W3094203970,5G Security Challenges and Opportunities: A System Approach,"The digital transformation brought by 5G is redefining current models of end-to-end connectivity and service reliability to include security-by-design principles necessary to enable 5G to achieve its promise. 5G trustworthiness highlights the importance of embedding security capabilities from the very beginning while the 5G architecture is being defined and standardized. Security requirements need to overlay and permeate through the different layers of the 5G systems (physical, network, and application) as well as different parts of an E2E5G architecture within a risk management framework that takes into account the evolving security threats landscape. 5G presents a typical use-case of wireless communication and computer networking convergence, where 5G fundamental building blocks include components such as Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and the edge cloud. This convergence extends many of the security challenges and opportunities applicable to SDN/NFV and cloud to 5G networks. Thus, 5G security needs to consider additional security requirements (compared to previous generations) such as SDN controller security, hypervisor security, orchestrator security, cloud security, edge security, etc. At the same time, 5G networks offer security improvement opportunities that should be considered. Here, 5G architectural flexibility, programmability and complexity can be harnessed to improve resilience and reliability.",2020-09-01,2020,Ashutosh Dutta; Eman Hammad,Johns Hopkins University,2020 IEEE 3rd 5G World Forum (5GWF),73,https://doi.org/10.1109/5gwf49715.2020.9221122,Defense_Security,Computer science; Cloud computing security; Security service; Computer security model; Computer security,0.6
W3014204465,"Advances in Microwave Near-Field Imaging: Prototypes, Systems, and Applications","Microwave imaging employs detection techniques to evaluate hidden or embedded objects in a structure or media using electro-magnetic (EM) waves in the microwave range, 300 MHz-300 GHz. Microwave imaging is often associated with radar detection such as target location and tracking, weather-pattern recognition, and underground surveillance, which are far-field applications. In recent years, due to microwaves' ability to penetrate optically opaque media, short-range applications, including medical imaging, nondestructive testing (NDT) and quality evaluation, through-the-wall imaging, and security screening, have been developed. Microwave near-field imaging most often occurs when detecting the profile of an object within the short range (when the distance from the sensor to the object is less than one wavelength to several wave-lengths) and depends on the electrical size of the antenna(s) and target.",2020-03-31,2020,Wenyi Shao; Todd R.

W3034639796,The operational readiness capacities of the grassroots health system in responses to epidemics: Implications for COVID-19 control in Vietnam,"The operational readiness capacities of the grassroots health system in responses to epidemics: Implications for COVID-19 control in Vietnam Background There is a paucity of data on the operational readiness capacities of the grassroots health system in Vietnam while it plays a vital role as a first-line defense against health emergencies, including the coronavirus disease .This study, therefore, aims to assess the operational readiness capacities of the grassroots health system in response to epidemics and provides implications for controlling COVID-19 in Vietnam. MethodsAn online cross-sectional study using the respondent-driven sampling technique was conducted with 6029 health professionals and medical students in Vietnam from December 2019 to February 2020.The operational readiness capacities of the health system were assessed by the sufficiency of health professionals, administrative and logistics staffs, equipment and facilities, and general capacity of health professionals.Kruskal-Wallis test, Fisher exact test and χ 2 test were employed to identify the differences among variables.Tobit and censored regression models were operated to determine associated factors. ResultsThe operational readiness capacities of the grassroots health system for four assessed criteria were at moderate levels, ranging from 6.3 to 6.8 over 10.In Vietnam, the grassroots health system in rural areas, in the South, and at the district level were more likely to be vulnerable compared to their counterparts. ConclusionsAccording to empirical data, this study reveals the vulnerability of the grassroots health system in Vietnam and provides the rationality of prompt and vigorous actions of the Vietnamese Government against COVID-19.Findings also offer useful insights for effective strategies to strengthen the grassroots health system in the long term.In the short term, practicing precautionary measures and mobilizing human resources, as well as medical equipment, are needed to successfully contain COVID-19 in Vietnam.",2020-06-01,2020,Bach Xuan Tran; Men Thi Hoang; Hai Quang Pham; Chi Linh Hoang; Huong Thi Le,Johns Hopkins University,Journal of Global Health,54,https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.10.011006,Defense_Security,Grassroots; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); Environmental health,0.508
W3111554718,Aligning Climate Change and Sustainable Development Goals With an Innovation Systems Roadmap for Renewable Power,"Energy development improves quality of life for humans, but also incurs environmental consequences. A global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy may mitigate climate change but may also undermine the capacity to achieve some or all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this study, we use an innovation systems approach to construct a comprehensive roadmap for solar and wind energy to anticipate and improve impacts of a transition to a low carbon future in a manner ensuring climate goals and SDGs are mutually reinforcing. Our multidisciplinary approach began with an assessment of public investments in renewable energy followed by a 2-day research prioritization workshop. Fifty-eight expert workshop participants identified six research themes that proactively address the environmental sustainability of renewable energy. Next, we identified linkages between the six research themes and all 17 SDGs. Finally, we conducted a scientiometric analysis to analyze the research maturity of these themes. The results of these efforts elucidated the limits of existing knowledge of renewable energy-SDG interactions, informing the development of a research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RD3) roadmap to a renewable energy future aligned with both climate goals and SDGs. The RD3 roadmap has been designed to systematically develop solutions for diverse actors and organizations. Overall, our findings confer a broad vision for a sustainable transition to renewables to minimize unintended environmental consequences while supporting interoperability among actors particularly poised to influence its magnitude and direction.",2020-12-18,2020,Rebecca R.

W3204188945,Study of Pre-Processing Defenses Against Adversarial Attacks on State-of-the-Art Speaker Recognition Systems,"Adversarial examples are designed to fool the speaker recognition (SR) system by adding a carefully crafted human-imperceptible noise to the speech signals. Posing a severe security threat to state-of-the-art SR systems, it becomes vital to deep-dive and study their vulnerabilities. Moreover, it is of greater importance to propose countermeasures that can protect the systems against these attacks. Addressing these concerns, we first investigated how state-of-the-art x-vector based SR systems are affected by white-box adversarial attacks, i.e., when the adversary has full knowledge of the system. x-Vector based SR systems are evaluated against white-box adversarial attacks common in the literature like fast gradient sign method (FGSM), basic iterative method (BIM)–a.k.a. iterative-FGSM–, projected gradient descent (PGD), and Carlini-Wagner (CW) attack. To mitigate against these attacks, we investigated four pre-processing defenses which do not need adversarial examples during training. The four pre-processing defenses–viz. randomized smoothing, DefenseGAN, variational autoencoder (VAE), and Parallel Wave-GAN vocoder (PWG) are compared against the baseline defense of adversarial training. Performing powerful adaptive white-box adversarial attack (i.e., when the adversary has full knowledge of the system, including the defense), our conclusions indicate that SR systems were extremely vulnerable under BIM, PGD, and CW attacks. Among the proposed pre-processing defenses, PWG combined with randomized smoothing offers the most protection against the attacks, with accuracy averaging 93% compared to 52% in the undefended system and an absolute improvement > 90% for BIM attacks with L∞ > 0.001 and CW attack.",2021-01-01,2021,Sonal Joshi; Jesús Villalba; Piotr Żelasko; Laureano Moro-Velázquez; Najim Dehak,Johns Hopkins University,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,35,https://doi.org/10.1109/tifs.2021.3116438,Defense_Security,Adversarial system; Computer science; Adversary; Smoothing; Computer security,0.717
W3010767619,Ingestible Sensors and Sensing Systems for Minimally Invasive Diagnosis and Monitoring: The Next Frontier in Minimally Invasive Screening,"Ingestible electronic systems that are capable of embedded sensing, particularly within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and its accessory organs, have the potential to screen for diseases that are difficult if not impossible to detect at an early stage using other means. Furthermore, these devices have the potential to (1) reduce labor and facility costs for a variety of procedures, (2) promote research for discovering new biomarker targets for associated pathologies, (3) promote the development of autonomous or semiautonomous diagnostic aids for consumers, and (4) provide a foundation for epithelially targeted therapeutic interventions. These technological advances have the potential to make disease surveillance and treatment far more effective for a variety of conditions, allowing patients to lead longer and more productive lives.

W3130618877,SCAN: System for Camera Autonomous Navigation in Robotic-Assisted Surgery,"Robot-Assisted systems for Minimally Invasive Surgery enhance the surgeon capability, however, direct control over both the surgical tools and the endoscope results in an increased workload that leads to longer operation times. This work investigates the introduction of SCAN (System for Camera Autonomous Navigation) to overcome this limitation. An experimental study involving 12 participants was carried out with the da Vinci Research Kit. Each user tested two novel camera control modalities, autonomous and semi-autonomous, as well as the current manual control of the camera, while carrying out a dry-lab task. Among the camera control modalities, the autonomous navigation achieved better objective performances and the highest user confidence. Moreover, the autonomous control (along with the semi-autonomous one) was able to optimize some metrics related to the robotic surgery workflow.",2020-10-24,2020,Tommaso Da Col; Andrea Mariani; Anton Deguet; Arianna Menciassi; Peter Kazanzides,Politecnico di Milano,2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),28,https://doi.org/10.1109/iros45743.2020.9341548,Autonomous_Systems,Modalities; Task (project management); Workflow; Computer science; Workload,0.925

W3200209451,A Dexterous Robotic System for Autonomous Debridement of Osteolytic Bone Lesions in Confined Spaces: Human Cadaver Studies,"This article presents a dexterous robotic system for autonomous debridement of osteolytic bone lesions in confined spaces. The proposed system is distinguished from the state-of-the-art orthopedics systems because it combines a rigid-link robot with a continuum manipulator (CM) that enhances reach in difficult-to-access spaces often encountered in surgery. The CM is equipped with flexible debriding instruments and fiber Bragg grating sensors. The surgeon plans on the patient's preoperative computed tomography and the robotic system performs the task autonomously under the surgeon's supervision. An optimization-based controller generates control commands on the fly to execute the task while satisfying physical and safety constraints. The system design and controller are discussed and extensive simulation, phantom and human cadaver experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance, workspace, and dexterity in confined spaces. Mean and standard deviation of target placement are 0.5 and 0.18 mm, and the robotic system covers 91% of the workspace behind an acetabular implant in treatment of hip osteolysis, compared to the 54% that is achieved by conventional rigid tools.",2021-07-21,2021,Shahriar Sefati; Rachel Hegeman; Iulian Iordachita; Russell H.

W3121831947,"The SEE Study: Safety, Efficacy, and Equity of Implementing Autonomous Artificial Intelligence for Diagnosing Diabetic Retinopathy in Youth","OBJECTIVE Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide. Screening for DR is recommended in children and adolescents, but adherence is poor. Recently, autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been developed for early detection of DR and have been included in the American Diabetes Association’s guidelines for screening in adults. We sought to determine the diagnostic efficacy of autonomous AI for the diabetic eye exam in youth with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this prospective study, point-of-care diabetic eye exam was implemented using a nonmydriatic fundus camera with an autonomous AI system for detection of DR in a multidisciplinary pediatric diabetes center. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnosability of AI was compared with consensus grading by retinal specialists, who were masked to AI output. Adherence to screening guidelines was measured before and after AI implementation. RESULTS Three hundred ten youth with diabetes aged 5–21 years were included, of whom 4.2% had DR. Diagnosability of AI was 97.5% (302 of 310). The sensitivity and specificity of AI to detect more-than-mild DR was 85.7% (95% CI 42.1–99.6%) and 79.3% (74.3–83.8%), respectively, compared with the reference standard as defined by retina specialists. Adherence improved from 49% to 95% after AI implementation. CONCLUSIONS Use of a nonmydriatic fundus camera with autonomous AI was safe and effective for the diabetic eye exam in youth in our study. Adherence to screening guidelines improved with AI implementation. As the prevalence of diabetes increases in youth and adherence to screening guidelines remains suboptimal, effective strategies for diabetic eye exams in this population are needed.",2021-01-21,2021,Risa M.

W3081954207,A Surgical Robotic System for Treatment of Pelvic Osteolysis Using an FBG-Equipped Continuum Manipulator and Flexible Instruments,"This paper presents the development and experimental evaluation of a redundant robotic system for the less-invasive treatment of osteolysis (bone degradation) behind the acetabular implant during total hip replacement revision surgery. The system comprises a rigid-link positioning robot and a Continuum Dexterous Manipulator (CDM) equipped with highly flexible debriding tools and a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)-based sensor. The robot and the continuum manipulator are controlled concurrently via an optimization-based framework using the Tip Position Estimation (TPE) from the FBG sensor as feedback. Performance of the system is evaluated on a setup that consists of an acetabular cup and saw-bone phantom simulating the bone behind the cup. Experiments consist of performing the surgical procedure on the simulated phantom setup. CDM TPE using FBGs, target location placement, cutting performance, and the concurrent control algorithm capability in achieving the desired tasks are evaluated. Mean and standard deviation of the CDM TPE from the FBG sensor and the robotic system are 0.50 mm, and 0.18 mm, respectively. Using the developed surgical system, accurate positioning and successful cutting of desired straight-line and curvilinear paths on saw-bone phantoms behind the cup with different densities are demonstrated. Compared to the conventional rigid tools, the workspace reach behind the acetabular cup is 2.47 times greater when using the developed robotic system.",2020-08-31,2020,Shahriar Sefati; Rachel Hegeman; Farshid Alambeigi; Iulian Iordachita; Peter Kazanzides,Johns Hopkins University,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,52,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmech.2020.3020504,Autonomous_Systems,Imaging phantom; Workspace; Fiber Bragg grating; Positioning system; Robot,0.717
W4224470041,Autonomous Spinal Robotic System for Transforaminal Lumbar Epidural Injections: A Proof of Concept of Study,"Phantom study.The aim of our study is to demonstrate in a proof-of-concept model whether the use of a marker less autonomous robotic controlled injection delivery system will increase accuracy in the lumbar spine.Ideal transforaminal epidural injection trajectories (bilateral L2/3, L3/4, L4/5, L5/S1 and S1) were planned out on a virtual pre-operative planning software by 1 experienced provider. Twenty transforaminal epidural injections were administered in a lumbar spine phantom model, 10 using a freehand procedure, and 10 using a marker less autonomous spinal robotic system. Procedural accuracy, defined as the difference between pre-operative planning and actual post-operative needle tip distance (mm) and angular orientation (degrees), were assessed between the freehand and robotic procedures.Procedural accuracy for robotically placed transforaminal epidural injections was significantly higher with the difference in pre- and post-operative needle tip distance being 20.1 (±5.0) mm in the freehand procedure and 11.4 (±3.9) mm in the robotically placed procedure (P < .001). Needle tip precision for the freehand technique was 15.6 mm (26.3 - 10.7) compared to 10.1 mm (16.3 - 6.1) for the robotic technique. Differences in needle angular orientation deviation were 5.6 (±3.3) degrees in the robotically placed procedure and 12.0 (±4.8) degrees in the freehand procedure (P = .003).The robotic system allowed for comparable placement of transforaminal epidural injections as a freehand technique by an experienced provider, with additional benefits of improved accuracy and precision.",2022-04-25,2022,Adam Margalit; Henry Phalen; Cong Gao; Justin Ma; Krishna V.

W3215643866,ColibriDoc: an Eye-in-Hand Autonomous Trocar Docking System,"Retinal surgery is a complex medical procedure that requires exceptional expertise and dexterity. For this purpose, several robotic platforms are currently under development to enable or improve the outcome of microsurgical tasks. Since the control of such robots is often designed for navigation inside the eye in proximity to the retina, successful trocar docking and insertion of the instrument into the eye represents an additional cognitive effort, and is therefore one of the open challenges in robotic retinal surgery. For this purpose, we present a platform for autonomous trocar docking that combines computer vision and a robotic setup. Inspired by the Cuban Colibri (hummingbird) aligning its beak to a flower using only vision, we mount a camera onto the endeffector of a robotic system. By estimating the position and pose of the trocar, the robot is able to autonomously align and navigate the instrument towards the Trocar Entry Point (TEP) and finally perform the insertion. Our experiments show that the proposed method is able to accurately estimate the position and pose of the trocar and achieve repeatable autonomous docking. The aim of this work is to reduce the complexity of the robotic setup prior to the surgical task and therefore, increase the intuitiveness of the system integration into clinical workflow.",2022-05-23,2022,Shervin Dehghani; Michael Sommersperger; Junjie Yang; Mehrdad Salehi; Benjamin Busam,,2022 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),12,https://doi.org/10.1109/icra46639.2022.9811364,Autonomous_Systems,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Robot; Computer vision; Visual servoing,0.85
W3140068452,A Robotic Platform to Navigate MRI-guided Focused Ultrasound System,"Focused ultrasound (FUS) technology attracts increasing interests accrediting to its non-invasive and painless treatment of tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance has been introduced to monitor this procedure, thus allowing the ultrasound foci to be precisely controlled. However, manual positioning of the FUS transducers is challenging, especially for the intra-operative (intra-op) adjustment in the MRI room. Currently, there are very few devices capable to provide robotic transducer positioning for the treatment of abdominopelvic organ diseases under MRI. The high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) spot would have to be ""steered"" to ablate large (>Ø 3.5 cm) or multiple tumors (e.g., in liver). To this end, we proposed a hydraulic-driven tele-operated robot platform that enables 5-DoF manipulation of the FUS transducer. Even operated close to the MRI iso-center, the robot can guarantee zero electromagnetic (EM) artifact to the MR image. Our proof-of-concept robot prototype can offer a large workspace (100 mm × 100 mm × 35 mm) for FUS foci steering. Accurate manipulation (0.2 mm in translation, 0.4° in rotation) of the FUS transducer holder is achieved using rolling diaphragm-sealed hydraulic actuators. The robot control responsiveness (from 0.1 to 4 Hz) is also evaluated to show the potential to compensate for the spot tracking error induced by respiratory motion. We also demonstrate the use of wireless radiofrequency (RF) markers to continuously register the robot task space in the MRI coordinates.",2021-03-25,2021,Jing Dai; Zhuoliang He; Ge Fang; Xiaomei Wang; Yingqi Li,University of Hong Kong,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,21,https://doi.org/10.1109/lra.2021.3068953,Autonomous_Systems,Computer science; Magnetic resonance imaging; Robot; Ultrasound; Transducer,0.567
W3177710911,An Investigative Study Into An Autonomous UAS Traffic Management System For Congested Airspace Safety,"Currently, Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) is the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) vision for air traffic management below 400 feet. Production UTM systems tend to reside only at specialized test sites and operational centers. UTM has been articulated as a concept of operation (ConOps) by the FAA. The UTM ConOps describes a complex interaction between UAS, UAS Operators, and the UTM system itself. These interactions may involve human operators, or be fully automated. Currently, most UTM studies and experimental prototypes do not look at the UTM concept from end-to-end; instead, they focus on specific aspects of UTM and thus cannot explore and test the holistic performance of a UTM ecosystem. Equally important is ensuring that production UTM can scale to meet the demands of future airspace, which is estimated to be 65,000 UAS operations (takeoffs and landings) per hour by 2035. The busiest US airports currently handle 300 operations per hour. In this paper, we evaluate a portion of the UTM system using a set of autonomous algorithms for flight plan de-confliction. Preliminary results suggest that the autonomy algorithms used for path planning, strategic de-confliction, and detect and avoid (DAA) are capable of scaling to high-congestion scenarios while drastically reducing collisions between UAS, even with almost all UAS deviating from de-conflicted plans (i.e., rogue UAS). We also observed that de-confliction algorithms represent a dominating safety layer in the separation hierarchy, since the strategic de-confliction algorithms manage airspace density, albeit at the cost of longer mission completion times. Our testing was done using a MATLAB simulator, which used the RRT* algorithm for flight planning, two different schedulers (Genetic Algorithm and the NASA Stratway Strategic Conflict Resolution algorithm) for strategic de-confliction, and the Airborne Collision Avoidance System for small unmanned aircraft systems (ACAS sXu) for DAA.",2021-06-01,2021,Lanier Watkins; Nick Sarfaraz; Sebastian Zanlongo; Joshua Silbermann; Tyler Young,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,2022 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops),15,https://doi.org/10.1109/iccworkshops50388.2021.9473838,Autonomous_Systems,Air traffic management; Systems engineering; Computer science; Aeronautics; Air traffic control,0.775

W4298139715,Generalized Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (G-SLAM) as unification framework for natural and artificial intelligences: towards reverse engineering the hippocampal/entorhinal system and principles of high-level cognition,"Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) represents a fundamental problem for autonomous embodied systems, for which the hippocampal/entorhinal system (H/E-S) has been optimized over the course of evolution. We have developed a biologically-inspired SLAM architecture based on latent variable generative modeling within the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference (FEP-AI) framework, which affords flexible navigation and planning in mobile robots. We have primarily focused on attempting to reverse engineer H/E-S ""design"" properties, but here we consider ways in which SLAM principles from robotics may help us better understand nervous systems and emergent minds. After reviewing LatentSLAM and notable features of this control architecture, we consider how the H/E-S may realize these functional properties not only for physical navigation, but also with respect to high-level cognition understood as generalized simultaneous localization and mapping (G-SLAM). We focus on loop-closure, graph-relaxation, and node duplication as particularly impactful architectural features, suggesting these computational phenomena may contribute to understanding cognitive insight (as proto-causal-inference), accommodation (as integration into existing schemas), and assimilation (as category formation). All these operations can similarly be describable in terms of structure/category learning on multiple levels of abstraction. However, here we adopt an ecological rationality perspective, framing H/E-S functions as orchestrating SLAM processes within both concrete and abstract hypothesis spaces. In this navigation/search process, adaptive cognitive equilibration between assimilation and accommodation involves balancing tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation; this dynamic equilibrium may be near optimally realized in FEP-AI, wherein control systems governed by expected free energy objective functions naturally balance model simplicity and accuracy. With respect to structure learning, such a balance would involve constructing models and categories that are neither too inclusive nor exclusive. We propose these (generalized) SLAM phenomena may represent some of the most impactful sources of variation in cognition both within and between individuals, suggesting that modulators of H/E-S functioning may potentially illuminate their adaptive significances as fundamental cybernetic control parameters. Finally, we discuss how understanding H/E-S contributions to G-SLAM may provide a unifying framework for high-level cognition and its potential realization in artificial intelligences.",2022-09-30,2022,Adam Safron; Ozan Çatal; Tim Verbelen,Indiana University Bloomington,Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience,21,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2022.787659,Autonomous_Systems,Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Simultaneous localization and mapping; Inference; Cognitive map,1.0
W3215817211,A Surgical Robotic System for Long-Bone Fracture Alignment: Prototyping and Cadaver Study,"In this paper, we design, develop, and validate a surgical robotic system, entitled Robossis, to assist long-bone fracture reduction, i.e., alignment, surgeries. Unlike traditional long-bone fracture surgeries, Robossis enables the surgeon to precisely align the fractured bone in the presence of large traction forces and torques. The proposed surgical system includes a novel 3-armed robot, a bone-gripping mechanism, and a master controller. The 6-DOF 3-armed wide-open parallel robot has a unique architecture, which facilitates positioning the bone inside the robot, providing a large workspace for surgical maneuvers. Kinematic analysis shows that the symmetric 3-armed mechanism provides a significant advantage over the Gough-Stewart platform, i.e., 15 times larger rotational workspace, which is a vital advantage for fracture alignment. Theoretical and experimental testing are performed to demonstrate Robossis performance, including high accuracy and force insertion capabilities. A successful cadaver test was performed using a Robossis prototype, which shows that guided by intraoperative X-ray imaging, Robossis is able to manipulate bone in all translational and rotational directions while encountering the muscle payload surrounding the femur. Robossis is designed to balance accuracy, payload, and workspace, and its innovative design presents major advantages over the existing robot designs for the reduction of long-bone fractures.",2021-11-19,2021,Marzieh S.

W4200061962,Generalized Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (G-SLAM) as unification framework for natural and artificial intelligences: towards reverse engineering the hippocampal/entorhinal system and principles of high-level cognition,"Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) represents a fundamental problem for autonomous embodied systems, for which the hippocampal/entorhinal system (H/E-S) has been optimized over the course of evolution. We have developed a biologically-inspired SLAM architecture based on latent variable generative modeling within the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference (FEP-AI) framework, which affords flexible navigation and planning in mobile robots. We have primarily focused on attempting to reverse engineer H/E-S ‘design’ properties, but here we consider ways in which SLAM principles from robotics may help us better understand nervous systems and emergent minds. After reviewing LatentSLAM and notable features of this control architecture, we consider how the H/E-S may realize these functional properties not only for physical navigation, but also with respect to high-level cognition understood as generalized simultaneous localization and mapping (G-SLAM). We focus on loop-closure, graph-relaxation, and node duplication as particularly impactful architectural features, suggesting these computational phenomena may contribute to understanding cognitive insight (as proto-causal-inference), accommodation (as integration into existing schemas), and assimilation (as category formation). All these operations can similarly be describable in terms of structure/category learning on multiple levels of abstraction. However, here we adopt an ecological rationality perspective, framing H/E-S functions as orchestrating SLAM processes within both concrete and abstract hypothesis spaces. In this navigation/search process, adaptive cognitive equilibration between assimilation and accommodation involves balancing tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation; this dynamic equilibrium may be near optimally realized in FEP-AI, wherein control systems governed by expected free energy objective functions naturally balance model simplicity and accuracy. With respect to structure learning, such a balance would involve constructing models and categories that are neither too inclusive nor exclusive. We propose these (generalized) SLAM phenomena may represent some of the most impactful sources of variation in cognition both within and between individuals, suggesting that modulators of H/E-S functioning may potentially illuminate their adaptive significances as fundamental cybernetic control parameters. Finally, we discuss how understanding H/E-S contributions to G-SLAM may provide a unifying framework for high-level cognition and its potential realization in artificial intelligences.",2021-10-01,2021,Adam Safron; Ozan Çatal; Tim Verbelen,Indiana University Bloomington,,18,https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tdw82,Autonomous_Systems,Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Simultaneous localization and mapping; Cognitive map; Inference,1.0
W4389610034,Autonomous System for Tumor Resection (ASTR) - Dual-Arm Robotic Midline Partial Glossectomy,"Head and neck cancers are the seventh most common cancers worldwide, with squamous cell carcinoma being the most prevalent histologic subtype. Surgical resection is a primary treatment modality for many patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and accurately identifying tumor boundaries and ensuring sufficient resection margins are critical for optimizing oncologic outcomes. This study presents an innovative autonomous system for tumor resection (ASTR) and conducts a feasibility study by performing supervised autonomous midline partial glossectomy for pseudotumor with millimeter accuracy. The proposed ASTR system consists of a dual-camera vision system, an electrosurgical instrument, a newly developed vacuum grasping instrument, two 6-DOF manipulators, and a novel autonomous control system. The letter introduces an ontology-based research framework for creating and implementing a complex autonomous surgical workflow, using the glossectomy as a case study. Porcine tongue tissues are used in this study, and marked using color inks and near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) markers to indicate the pseudotumor. ASTR actively monitors the NIRF markers and gathers spatial and color data from the samples, enabling planning and execution of robot trajectories in accordance with the proposed glossectomy workflow. The system successfully performs six consecutive supervised autonomous pseudotumor resections on porcine specimens.

W4319988692,ASAP: A Semi-Autonomous Precise System for Telesurgery During Communication Delays,"In remote, rural, and disadvantaged areas, telesurgery can be severely hindered by limitations of communication infrastructure. In conventional telesurgery, delays as small as 300ms can produce fatal surgical errors. To mitigate the effect of communication delays during telesurgery, we introduce a semi-autonomous system that decouples the user interaction from the robot execution. This system uses a physics-based simulator where a surgeon can demonstrate individual surgical subtasks, with immediate graphical feedback. Each subtask is performed asynchronously, unaffected by communication latency, jitter, and packet loss. A surgical step recognition module extracts the intended actions from the observed surgeon-simulation interaction. The remote robot can perform each one of these actions autonomously. The action recognition system leveraged a transfer learning approach that minimized the data needed during training, and most of the learning is obtained from simulated data. We tested this system in two tasks: fluid-submerged peg transfer (resembling bleeding events) and surgical debridement. The system showed robustness to delays of up to 5 seconds, maintaining a performance rate of 87% for peg transfer and 88% for debridement. Also, the framework reduced the completion time under delays by 45% and 11% during peg transfer and debridement, respectively.",2023-01-25,2023,Glebys Gonzalez; Mythra V.

The purpose of this study is to describe the Space System for Minimally Invasive Surgery (SY-MIS©) project, which started in 2016 under the supervision of the Center for Space Systems (C-SET). The process connects the best features of the following machines: Biomedik Surgeon, Space Biosurgeon, SP-LAP 1, and SP-LAP 2, which were defined using the VDI 2221 guidelines. This research uses methods based on 3 standards: i) Biomedical design: ISO 9001-13485 / FDA 21 CFR 820.30 / ASTM F1744-96(2016); ii) Aerospace human factors: HF-STD-001; iii) Mechatronics design: VDI 2206. The results depict the conceptual biomedical design of a novel training system named Surgical Engineering and Mechatronic System (SETY©), which integrates the use of 2 laparoscopic tools and 2 anthropomorphic mini-robotic arms (6 DOF). It has been validated by the Evaluation of Technical Criteria, getting a total score of 90% related to clinical assessment, machine adaptability, and robustness. The novelty of the research lies in the introduction of a new procedure that covers the simultaneous use of laparoscopic and robotic systems, named Hybrid Cyber-Physical Surgery (HYS©). In conclusion, the development of SY-MIS© promotes the use of advanced technologies to improve surgical procedures and human-machine medical cooperation for the next frontier of habitability on other planets.

In this letter, we develop an autonomous system with model-based planning and markerless tissue tracking techniques for autonomous vaginal cuff closure. The proposed planning method constructs an optimal suture plan that minimizes tissue collisions with the robotic suturing tool. Moreover, DeepLabCut is utilized for autonomous markerless soft-tissue tracking in robotic vaginal cuff closure. Furthermore, an instruction-based autonomous surgery interface (ASI) is designed to automate the complex suturing workflow. The proposed planning method is evaluated via a robotics simulator and real-world suture-placement tests. End-to-end vaginal cuff closure via Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR) on synthetic tissues was carried out and compared to the suturing results via conventional laparoscopic and robot-assisted approaches performed by experienced surgeons. The comparison results indicate that by using the proposed planning pipeline, STAR outperforms conventional laparoscopic and robotic-assisted methods with better accuracy and consistency, thus achieving a higher success rate of autonomous suture placement.",2023-05-05,2023,Michael Kam; Shuwen Wei; Justin D.

W4210656949,Autonomous robotic laparoscopic surgery for intestinal anastomosis,"Autonomous robotic surgery has the potential to provide efficacy, safety, and consistency independent of individual surgeon's skill and experience. Autonomous anastomosis is a challenging soft-tissue surgery task because it requires intricate imaging, tissue tracking, and surgical planning techniques, as well as a precise execution via highly adaptable control strategies often in unstructured and deformable environments. In the laparoscopic setting, such surgeries are even more challenging because of the need for high maneuverability and repeatability under motion and vision constraints. Here we describe an enhanced autonomous strategy for laparoscopic soft tissue surgery and demonstrate robotic laparoscopic small bowel anastomosis in phantom and in vivo intestinal tissues. This enhanced autonomous strategy allows the operator to select among autonomously generated surgical plans and the robot executes a wide range of tasks independently. We then use our enhanced autonomous strategy to perform in vivo autonomous robotic laparoscopic surgery for intestinal anastomosis on porcine models over a 1-week survival period. We compared the anastomosis quality criteria-including needle placement corrections, suture spacing, suture bite size, completion time, lumen patency, and leak pressure-of the developed autonomous system, manual laparoscopic surgery, and robot-assisted surgery (RAS). Data from a phantom model indicate that our system outperforms expert surgeons' manual technique and RAS technique in terms of consistency and accuracy. This was also replicated in the in vivo model. These results demonstrate that surgical robots exhibiting high levels of autonomy have the potential to improve consistency, patient outcomes, and access to a standard surgical technique.",2022-01-26,2022,Hamed Saeidi; Justin D.

W4386823554,Clinical Implementation of Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Systems for Diabetic Eye Exams: Considerations for Success,"Diabetic eye disease (DED), including diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME), is a complication of diabetes and the leading cause of vision loss among working-age adults in the United States (1-3).Screening for DED can lead to its early identification and treatment, thereby preventing irreversible vision loss (4-7).However, rates of diabetic eye exams for DED screening remain suboptimal, with reported rates in the United States ranging from 11 to 70% (8,9).Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI)-based diabetic eye exams have the potential to increase access to these exams and facilitate the early identification of DED so that timely treatment can be administered to prevent blindness.Autonomous AI systems use a robotic nonmydriatic fundus camera with a built-in AI algorithm to provide feedback to the operator to acquire high-quality fundus photographs for determining the presence or absence of referable DED, with immediate results after image acquisition at the point of care (10-12).The autonomous AI system guides the operator to acquire two color fundus images determined to be of adequate quality using an image quality algorithm, with one each centered on the fovea and the optic nerve, and guides the operator to retake any images of insufficient quality.It is important to note that these systems have been rigorously validated against a prognostic standard to identify DR and DME and do not diagnose other eye conditions.The first autonomous AI diagnostic system (Luminetics-Core, formerly IDx-DR, Digital Diagnostics, Coralville, IA) was de novo-authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 after completion of a pivotal trial demonstrating its safety, efficacy, and equity in diagnosing referable DED compared with a prognostic standard outcome (10).In the pivotal trial, the autonomous AI system demonstrated 87% sensitivity and 90% specificity in detecting referable DR and/or DME in adults (10,13).Since this first autonomous AI system was approved, two additional autonomous AI systems have been authorized under the FDA's 510(k) authorization process using it as a predicate, and there are several other autonomous AI systems in different stages of development (11,12).",2023-09-18,2023,Risa M.

W3214199142,"Assuring Autonomous UAS Traffic Management Systems Using Explainable, Fuzzy Logic, Black Box Monitoring","Researchers have shown via simulation and early flight tests the feasibility and safety benefit of adding autonomy to the concept of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM), which is the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) vision for air traffic management below 400 feet. Such simulations are a complex interaction between UAS, UAS operators, and the UTM system. Autonomy in this system is achieved through the algorithms used for strategic de-confliction (UAS launch scheduling) and flight planning (creates waypoints from delays introduced by scheduling), which have been shown to improve safety in congested UAS airspace. However, autonomous algorithms have been known to make poor decisions without notice, and thus need to be constantly monitored to prevent these decisions from negatively affecting airspace performance and safety. This is the impetus for developing and implementing a fuzzy assurance black box monitor. Using a rule set generated from parameters that have been shown to improve safety in congested airspace, this monitor only considers the inputs and outputs of the autonomous UTM system to estimate the risk of the autonomous algorithms making poor decisions. Fuzzy rules that fire during the operation of the fuzzy assurance monitor help identify offending algorithms and their poor decisions, and thus provide a level of explainable artificial intelligence (AI) capability. The goal is to use fuzzy inference rules to evaluate the performance of strategic de-confliction algorithms in the UTM simulation. We investigate several airspace operational use cases (i.e., normal and rogue behavior in congested airspace) and several different autonomous UTM configurations (No Strategic de-confliction and Strategic de-confliction). The simulation data is analyzed with the help of the fuzzy inference system rules to help identify offending algorithms and poor decisions that lead to unsafe airspace. Our results show that the fuzzy assurance monitor is able to use the inputs and outputs of the autonomous UTM system to assign safety risks appropriately across use cases and autonomous UTM configuration. The fuzzy assurance monitor can also provide insight on the performance trade-offs of black-box algorithms.",2021-08-11,2021,Denzel Hamilton; Lanier Watkins; Sebastian Zanlongo; Charles Leeper; Randall Sleight,Morgan State University,,7,https://doi.org/10.1109/iciafs52090.2021.9605908,Autonomous_Systems,Fuzzy logic; Air traffic control; Black box; Computer science; Scheduling (production processes),0.792

W3090595213,Towards Bimanual Vein Cannulation: Preliminary Study of a Bimanual Robotic System With a Dual Force Constraint Controller,"Retinal vein cannulation is a promising approach for treating retinal vein occlusion that involves injecting medicine into the occluded vessel to dissolve the clot. The approach remains largely unexploited clinically due to surgeon limitations in detecting interaction forces between surgical tools and retinal tissue. In this paper, a dual force constraint controller for robot-assisted retinal surgery was presented to keep the tool-to-vessel forces and tool-to-sclera forces below prescribed thresholds. A cannulation tool and forceps with dual force-sensing capability were developed and used to measure force information fed into the robot controller, which was implemented on existing Steady Hand Eye Robot platforms. The robotic system facilitates retinal vein cannulation by allowing a user to grasp the target vessel with the forceps and then enter the vessel with the cannula. The system was evaluated on an eye phantom. The results showed that, while the eyeball was subjected to rotational disturbances, the proposed controller actuates the robotic manipulators to maintain the average tool-to-vessel force at 10.9 mN and 13.1 mN and the average tool-to-sclera force at 38.1 mN and 41.2 mN for the cannula and the forcpes, respectively. Such small tool-to-tissue forces are acceptable to avoid retinal tissue injury. Additionally, two clinicians participated in a preliminary user study of the bimanual cannulation demonstrating that the operation time and tool-to-tissue forces are significantly decreased when using the bimanual robotic system as compared to freehand performance.",2020-05-01,2020,Changyan He; Ali Ebrahimi; Emily B Yang; Muller Urias; Yang Yang,Beihang University,,7,https://doi.org/10.1109/icra40945.2020.9196889,Autonomous_Systems,Sclera; Cannula; Retinal Vein; Forceps; Controller (irrigation),0.717

Our idea is to first compute accurate bounds on the Lipschitz constant of the neural network in certain directions of interest offline using a convex program. We then use these bounds to obtain an instantaneous but conservative polyhedral approximation of the reachable set using Lipschitz continuity arguments. To reduce conservatism, we incorporate our bounding algorithm within a branching strategy to decrease the over-approximation error within an arbitrary accuracy. We then extend our method to reachability analysis of control systems with neural network controllers. Finally, to capture the shape of the reachable sets as accurately as possible, we use sample trajectories to inform the directions of the reachable set over-approximations using Principal Com-ponent Analysis (PCA).

Examined in this paper is a traditional tubular oscillating water column device, and particular interest here is in designs that lead to optimization of power converted from shorter wind sea waves. A two step design procedure is investigated here, wherein a more approximate two-degree-of-freedom model is first used to identify relative dimensions (of device elements) that optimize power conversion from relative oscillations between the device elements. A more rigorous mathematical model based on the hydrodynamics of oscillating pressure distributions within solid oscillators is then used to provide the hydrodynamic coefficients, forces, and flow rates for the device.

However, making technology accessible for learning is challenging due to cost, safety and implementation concerns. This paper describes a method for drawing on current, real life challenges faced by researchers in the field and translating such experiences into a secondary school level program. The concept of the competition, application of LEGO Mindstorms® robotics platform, methods of organization and expansion, past experiences and future plans are presented. Our goal is to show an example of how to integrate off-the-shelf robotic technology with current real-world engineering challenges and to engage students in the fields of engineering, robotics, and medicine in a fun and exciting atmosphere. Introduction and Background Modern medical practice relies on innovation and technology to provide better solutions in the operating room. Doctors, scientists and engineers work together to improve current surgical care by designing tools and machines to overcome human limitations, namely precision, control, reliability, patience and memory. Computers and robots do not have these restrictions. Computers have had such an impact on surgery that many current procedures would be impossible or significantly more difficult without them. Computers aid surgeons by displaying images of internal organs through computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or exposing brain function through electroencephalographic analysis. Robots can function as surgical assistants [1] or even substitute for the surgeon on location (e.g. telesurgery). Robotics is a popular tool for science and engineering education on various levels because of its multidisciplinary nature. The development of a successful robot incorporates knowledge from a variety of disciplines such as physics, math, mechanical engineering, materials science, electrical engineering, and computer science as well as a variety of skills gained through practical experience. There is also a need for equipment: raw building materials and shop tools, wires and a soldering iron, a variety of computers and, often, complicated programming interfaces.

W4381613788,Predicting Surgical Experience After Robotic Nerve-sparing Radical Prostatectomy Simulation Using a Machine Learning–based Multimodal Analysis of Objective Performance Metrics,"Machine learning methods have emerged as objective tools to evaluate operative performance in urological procedures. Our objectives were to establish machine learning-based methods for predicting surgeon caseload for nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy using our validated hydrogel-based simulation platform and identify potential metrics of surgical expertise.Video, robotic kinematics, and force sensor data were collected from 35 board-certified urologists at the 2022 AUA conference. Video was annotated for surgical gestures. Objective performance indicators were derived from robotic system kinematic data. Force metrics were calculated from hydrogel model integrated sensors. Data were fitted to 3 supervised machine learning models-logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors-which were used to predict procedure-specific learning curve proficiency. Recursive feature elimination was used to optimize the best performing model.Logistic regression predicted caseload with the highest AUC score for 5/7 possible data combinations (force, 64%; objective performance indicators + gestures, 94%; objective performance indicators + force, 90%; gestures + force, 93%; objective performance indicators + gestures + force, 94%). Support vector machine predicted the highest AUC score for objective performance indicators (82%) and gestures (94%). Logistic regression with recursive feature elimination was the most effective model reaching 96% AUC in predicting case-specific experience. Most contributory features were identified across all model types.We have created a machine learning-based algorithm utilizing a novel combination of objective performance indicators, gesture analysis, and integrated force metrics to predict surgical experience, capable of discriminating between surgeons with low or high robot-assisted radical prostatectomy caseload with 96% AUC in a standardized, simulation-based environment.",2023-06-22,2023,Nathan Schuler; Lauren Shepard; Aaron Saxton; Jillian Russo; Daniel Johnston,Johns Hopkins University,Urology Practice,9,https://doi.org/10.1097/upj.0000000000000426,Autonomous_Systems,Medicine; Library science; Art history; Computer science; Art,0.567
W3182938540,Automated design of underactuated monolithic soft robotics structures with multiple predefined end poses,"The increasing frequency of robot interactions with humans and complex environments motivates the design and control of soft robotic systems made of compliant structures. Additive manufacturing processes enable the creation of new robotic systems and mechanisms that gain their compliance extrinsically through their design, rather than simply their material. With the ability to rapidly and affordably manufacture such mechanisms, the interest in producing custom task-specific underactuated mechanisms has grown. These mechanisms may be useful for highly repetitive tasks or complex situations where the simplicity of control outweighs the versatility of a more traditional robotic system. In the course of this work, new underactuated monolithic soft robotic mechanisms are presented along with automated design processes. The structures can reach multiple arbitrary end effector poses and are controlled with as few actuators as possible. Two methods for the automated design of such structures via inverse kinematics and two concepts for the mechanical realization are presented. Several functional models were created to illustrate possible application scenarios and validate the mechanical concepts. A novel contact surface was also developed and shown to improve the accuracy performance of these structures. These automated design methods contribute toward the general accessibility and usability of multi-pose underactuated extrinsically soft mechanisms.",2021-05-30,2021,Simon Schiele; Henry Phalen; Julian Kulozik; Yannick S.

W4396875095,One-Piece 3D-Printed Pneumatic Catheter: Dual-Segment Design with Integrated Robotics Control for Endovascular Interventions,"Soft robotics have propelled advancements in medical applications such as endovascular interventions through the development of soft steerable catheters. Despite their potential, existing catheters often require intricate manufacturing or complex control systems due to their inherent hysteresis and nonlinear material properties. This study introduces a novel catheter system featuring a 3D-printed hollow tip with two pneumatic bending units, facilitating rotation about two distinct axes without the need for additional fabrication steps. Finite element analysis simulations were used to optimize the catheter design while minimizing its diameter to 6.4 mm. Furthermore, an external robotic control system was integrated to perform physical experiments to assess the bending capabilities of the catheter tip. After calibration, the system exhibited proficient shape control, achieving a wide bending range from -47° to 169° under the integrated control system, and effectively conforming to 'C', 'S', and 'J' configurations with 0.53 degrees closed-loop accuracy. The catheter prototype demonstrated low hysteresis and high repeatability. The entire catheter system presents a pragmatic and cost-effective approach for the rapid prototyping and development of pneumatic steerable catheters. This novel system is ideally suited for testing preliminary concepts and educational applications in endovascular interventions.",2024-04-14,2024,Shaopeng Jiang; Lingyun Di; N.

W4210863149,CubeSat Security Attack Tree Analysis,"Once a novelty, small satellites, often referred to as CubeSats, have become important tools for a variety of space activities ranging from exploration to defense. Their relative affordability and short development timeline have made them attractive options to complement larger space vehicles, conduct reconnaissance and other finite tasks. The specialized nature of many CubeSat missions do not make their security any less important as their missions could easily be matters of national security. This paper demonstrates the use of attack tree analysis to assess vulnerabilities of a CubeSat. First, we abstract and build an architectural model of an operational CubeSat. We then create a series of attack trees for the abstracted architecture to illustrate a series of potential attack vectors for small satellites. We conclude by discussing some strategies that could be employed to improve CubeSat resilience.",2021-07-01,2021,Gregory Falco; Arun Viswanathan; Andrew Santangelo,Johns Hopkins University,,27,https://doi.org/10.1109/smc-it51442.2021.00016,Cybersecurity,CubeSat; Computer science; Timeline; Computer security; Resilience (materials science),0.6

While the space community generally refers to GSaaS as a singular model, there are several flavors of these systems. After a description of the general GSaaS network's basic structure, this paper presents an analysis of four reference architectures of GSaaS. On the basis of this systems engineering analysis, a cybersecurity analysis of the critical nodes will be carried out through the attack tree method. Later the cybersecurity implication both of technical and strategic characteristic of GSaaS networks will be discussed and put in relation with the current state of space cyberwarfare landscape.",2023-03-04,2023,Nicolò Boschetti; Chelsea Smethurst; Gregory Epiphaniou; Carsten Maple; Johan Sigholm,Johns Hopkins University,IEEE Aerospace Conference,2,https://doi.org/10.1109/aero55745.2023.10115903,Cybersecurity,Computer security; Computer science; Service (business); Relation (database); Space (punctuation),0.867
W4320802206,Cybersecurity as a Tic-Tac-Toe Game Using Autonomous Forwards (Attacking) And Backwards (Defending) Penetration Testing in a Cyber Adversarial Artificial Intelligence System,"In this paper, we investigate the potential behavior of Artificial Intelligence (AI) black hat hackers and the ability of ethical human hackers to defend against them. To this end, we develop an adversarial AI testbed, which marries game board play to the cyber realm by employing a statistical AI algorithm that maps every move made on the tic-tac-toe game board to an attack or defensive move made in the cyber realm. Our work demonstrates that this approach is an effective means of constraining the possible cybersecurity state space for autonomous forwards (i.e., attacking) and backwards (i.e., defending) penetration testing. Our results suggest that welltrained AI hackers may be nearly impossible to beat by human defenders unless prior knowledge of their possible attack strategies are known; however, for humans, this approach quickly becomes intractable. Also, we have observed that different AI algorithms used to search (play) the game state space (and thus the cyber state space) behave as different AI hacker personalities, which illustrates how forwards and backwards penetration testers with varying skills and knowledge would exploit or defend network vulnerabilities.",2022-10-19,2022,Samra Kasim; Nawal Valliani; Nelson Ka Ki Wong; Shahin Samadi; Lanier Watkins,Johns Hopkins University,,1,https://doi.org/10.1109/icosnikom56551.2022.10034922,Cybersecurity,Hacker; Computer security; Computer science; Adversarial system; Cyber-attack,0.642
W4214898980,Don’t Drink the Cyber: Extrapolating the Possibilities of Oldsmar’s Water Treatment Cyberattack,"Water treatment represents an essential critical infrastructure sector which has a direct impact on the health and well-being of its customers. Water treatment is often performed by municipalities with very limited budgets for cybersecurity resources. These underfunded, high-impact, targets represent an emerging cyber warfare attack-surface paradigm which poses a direct threat to the quality of life for millions of people. On February 5th, 2021, a water treatment plant in Oldsmar, Florida was the victim of an attempted cyberattack. This attack commanded the system to add a dangerous amount ofsodium hydroxide to water which supplied thousands. Direct exposure to sodium hydroxide causes painful burns to the exposed area with permanent internal damage likely upon ingestion. A system operator noticed this malicious behaviour and corrected the situation, minimizing the attack’s impact. This paper outlines the attack and illustrates how minor modifications to the attacker’s tactics, techniques, and procedures could have resulted in a cyber-derived catastrophe for thousands of unsuspecting citizens. Lastly, this paper explores the effectiveness of various low-cost cyber-physical security technologies when pitted against differing attacker models in these theoretical scenarios. These cybersecurity solutions are evaluated by cost, ease of use, implementation difficulty, and ability to support safe operation continuity when faced with adversary behaviour. The results of this evaluation illuminate a path forward for low-cost threat mitigation which increases the difficulty to compromise these critical cyber-physical systems. With attacks targeting industrial control systems on the rise, the Oldsmar water treatment cyberattack represents more than an individual incident, it can be viewed as a reflection of the current status of thousands of similar critical infrastructure systems that have yet to be caught in crosshairs of a competent and willing adversary with financial incentives and cyber warfare mission requirements serving as impetus for adversary willingness and any resulting large-scale cyber cataclysm.",2022-03-02,2022,James Cervini; Aviel D.

W3093070413,Adversarial Metric Attack and Defense for Person Re-Identification,"Person re-identification (re-ID) has attracted much attention recently due to its great importance in video surveillance. In general, distance metrics used to identify two person images are expected to be robust under various appearance changes. However, our work observes the extreme vulnerability of existing distance metrics to adversarial examples, generated by simply adding human-imperceptible perturbations to person images. Hence, the security danger is dramatically increased when deploying commercial re-ID systems in video surveillance. Although adversarial examples have been extensively applied for classification analysis, it is rarely studied in metric analysis like person re-identification. The most likely reason is the natural gap between the training and testing of re-ID networks, that is, the predictions of a re-ID network cannot be directly used during testing without an effective metric. In this work, we bridge the gap by proposing Adversarial Metric Attack, a parallel methodology to adversarial classification attacks. Comprehensive experiments clearly reveal the adversarial effects in re-ID systems. Meanwhile, we also present an early attempt of training a metric-preserving network, thereby defending the metric against adversarial attacks. At last, by benchmarking various adversarial settings, we expect that our work can facilitate the development of adversarial attack and defense in metric-based applications.",2020-10-16,2020,Song Bai; Yingwei Li; Yuyin Zhou; Qizhu Li; Philip H.

W4226232092,Segment and Complete: Defending Object Detectors against Adversarial Patch Attacks with Robust Patch Detection,"Object detection plays a key role in many security-critical systems. Adversarial patch attacks, which are easy to implement in the physical world, pose a serious threat to state-of-the-art object detectors. Developing reliable defenses for object detectors against patch attacks is critical but severely understudied. In this paper, we propose Segment and Complete defense (SAC), a general framework for defending object detectors against patch attacks through detection and removal of adversarial patches. We first train a patch segmenter that outputs patch masks which provide pixel-level localization of adversarial patches. We then propose a self adversarial training algorithm to robustify the patch segmenter. In addition, we design a robust shape completion algorithm, which is guaranteed to remove the entire patch from the images if the outputs of the patch segmenter are within a certain Hamming distance of the ground-truth patch masks. Our experiments on COCO and xView datasets demonstrate that SAC achieves superior robustness even under strong adaptive attacks with no reduction in performance on clean images, and generalizes well to unseen patch shapes, attack budgets, and unseen attack methods. Furthermore, we present the APRICOT-Mask dataset, which augments the APRICOT dataset with pixel-level annotations of adversarial patches. We show SAC can significantly reduce the targeted attack success rate of physical patch attacks.

Even with end-to-end encryption between the design owner and 3D-printer, side-channel attacks can be used to bypass cyber-security measures and obtain the underlying design. In this paper, we develop a method based on the power side-channel that enables accurate design reconstruction in the face of full encryption measures without any prior knowledge of the design. Our evaluation on a Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D Printer has shown 99 % accuracy in reconstruction, a significant improvement on the state of the art.

W3003625852,Unclonable photonic keys hardened against machine learning attacks,"The hallmark of the information age is the ease with which information is stored, accessed, and shared throughout the globe. This is enabled, in large part, by the simplicity of duplicating digital information without error. Unfortunately, an ever-growing consequence is the global threat to security and privacy enabled by our digital reliance. Specifically, modern secure communications and authentication suffer from formidable threats arising from the potential for copying of secret keys stored in digital media. With relatively little transfer of information, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate user, publish malicious software that is automatically accepted as safe by millions of computers, or eavesdrop on countless digital exchanges. To address this vulnerability, a new class of cryptographic devices known as physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are being developed. PUFs are modern realizations of an ancient concept, the physical key, and offer an attractive alternative for digital key storage. A user derives a digital key from the PUF’s physical behavior, which is sensitive to physical idiosyncrasies that are beyond fabrication tolerances. Thus, unlike conventional physical keys, a PUF cannot be duplicated and only the holder can extract the digital key. However, emerging machine learning (ML) methods are remarkably adept at learning behavior via training, and if such algorithms can learn to emulate a PUF, then the security is compromised. Unfortunately, such attacks are highly successful against conventional electronic PUFs. Here, we investigate ML attacks against a nonlinear silicon photonic PUF, a novel design that leverages nonlinear optical interactions in chaotic silicon microcavities. First, we investigate these devices’ resistance to cloning during fabrication and demonstrate their use as a source of large volumes of cryptographic key material. Next, we demonstrate that silicon photonic PUFs exhibit resistance to state-of-the-art ML attacks due to their nonlinearity and finally validate this resistance in an encryption scenario.",2020-01-01,2020,Bryan T.

W3212636545,Confronting Cyber Risk,"Abstract Confronting Cyber Risk: An Embedded Endurance Strategy for Cybersecurity is a practical leadership handbook defining a new strategy for improving cybersecurity and mitigating cyber risk. Written by two leading experts with extensive professional experience in cybersecurity, the book provides CEOs and cyber newcomers alike with novel, concrete guidance on how to implement a cutting-edge strategy to mitigate an organization’s overall risk to malicious cyberattacks. Using short, real-world case studies, the book highlights the need to address attack prevention and the resilience of each digital asset while also accounting for an incident’s potential impact on overall operations. In a world of hackers, artificial intelligence, and persistent ransomware attacks, the Embedded Endurance strategy embraces the reality of interdependent digital assets and provides an approach that addresses cyber risk at both the micro level (people, networks, systems and data) and the macro level (the organization). Most books about cybersecurity focus entirely on technology; the Embedded Endurance strategy recognizes the need for sophisticated thinking about hardware and software while also extending beyond to address operational, reputational and litigation risk. This book both provides the reader with a solid grounding in important prevention-focused technologies—such as cloud-based security and intrusion detection—and emphasizes the important role of incident response. By implementing an Embedded Endurance strategy, you can guide your team to blunt major cyber incidents with preventative and resilience measures engaged systematically across your organization.",2021-11-17,2021,Gregory Falco; Eric Rosenbach,Johns Hopkins University,Oxford University Press eBooks,10,https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780197526545.001.0001,Cybersecurity,Computer science,0.867
W4220770436,Application of machine learning in intelligent encryption for digital information of real-time image text under big data,"Abstract In the context of big data, the exploration of the application effect of machine learning in intelligent encryption for real-time image text digital information aims to improve the privacy information security of people. Aiming at the problem of digital information leakage of real-time image text, the convolutional neural network is introduced and improved by adding a preprocessing module to form AlexNet, to encrypt the digital information of real-time image text. Besides, to take into account both the security effect and the real-time performance of the system, the image text is encrypted by the chaotic sequence generated by a one-dimensional chaotic system called Logistic-Sine and a multi-dimensional chaotic system named Lorenz. In this way, a real-time image text encryption model is constructed by combining the chaotic function and AlexNet. Finally, a simulation experiment is performed to analyze the performance of this model. The comparative analysis indicates that the recognition accuracy of feature extraction of image text by the intelligent encryption model reaches 94.37%, which is at least 3.05% higher than that of other neural network models by scholars in related fields. In the security analysis of image text encryption, the information entropy of pixel values at (0, 0) of the proposed model is close to the ideal value 8. Meanwhile, the value of the number of pixels change rate is generally more than 99.50%, and the value of the unified average changing intensity is generally more than 33.50%. This demonstrates that the model has good security in resisting attacks. Therefore, the constructed model can provide good security guarantee under the premise of ensuring the recognition accuracy, which can provide experimental basis for improving the security performance of real-time image text data in the future.",2022-03-21,2022,Liang Liu; Melody Gao; Yong Zhang; Yu-Xiang Wang,Inner Mongolia University of Science and Technology,EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking,18,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13638-022-02111-9,Cybersecurity,Computer science; Encryption; Artificial intelligence; Chaotic; Pixel,0.792
W3106970112,Identification of Botnet Activity in IoT Network Traffic Using Machine Learning,"Today our world benefits from Internet of Things (IoT) technology; however, new security problems arise when these IoT devices are introduced into our homes. Because many of these IoT devices have access to the Internet and they have little to no security, they make our smart homes highly vulnerable to compromise. Some of the threats include IoT botnets and generic confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) attacks. Our research explores botnet detection by experimenting with supervised machine learning and deep-learning classifiers. Further, our approach assesses classifier performance on unbalanced datasets that contain benign data, mixed in with small amounts of malicious data. We demonstrate that the classifiers can separate malicious activity from benign activity within a small IoT network dataset. The classifiers can also separate malicious activity from benign activity in increasingly larger datasets. Our experiments have demonstrated incremental improvement in results for (1) accuracy, (2) probability of detection, and (3) probability of false alarm. The best performance results include 99.9% accuracy, 99.8% probability of detection, and 0% probability of false alarm.

W4306316898,Developing Scenarios Supporting Space-based IDS,"Satellites are essential to critical and commercial infrastructure used by governments, militaries, and industries worldwide. Satellites are prime targets for malicious cyber actors thanks to their relatively minimal defenses, the significance of their compromise, and their low barrier to entry. Due to technical limitations, satellite operators are hindered in their ability to quickly detect and respond to the presence of a cyber threat. Intrusion detection systems have demonstrated value in critical infrastructure, allowing operators to detect and prevent cyberattacks on their systems. The lack of cybersecurity resources that provide insight into adversarial attack patterns challenges the development of an intrusion detection system onboard a satellite. To overcome the lack of cybersecurity resources, we approach intrusion detection systems for satellites through the lens of penetration testing. This work begins by following the penetration testing process on a notional cube satellite to generate attack scenarios that can disrupt the satellite’s operations. We then compare the satellite attack scenarios with similar terrestrial-based attack patterns found in the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the common attack pattern enumeration and classification catalog. Through this comparison, satellite components that require malicious activity monitoring are identified and used as a medium for discussing a host-based and network-based intrusion detection system onboard a satellite.

W4391021696,Clustering Unsupervised Representations as Defense Against Poisoning Attacks on Speech Commands Classification System,"Poisoning attacks entail attackers intentionally tampering with training data. In this paper, we consider a dirty-label poisoning attack scenario on a speech commands classification system. The threat model assumes that certain utterances from one of the classes (source class) are poisoned by superimposing a trigger on it, and its label is changed to another class selected by the attacker (target class). We propose a filtering defense against such an attack. First, we use DIstillation with NO labels (DINO) to learn unsupervised representations for all the training examples. Next, we use K-means and LDA to cluster these representations. Finally, we keep the utterances with the most repeated label in their cluster for training and discard the rest. For a 10% poisoned source class, we demonstrate a drop in attack success rate from 99.75% to 0.25%.

W3162609778,Autonomous Navigation Assurance with Explainable AI and Security Monitoring,"With the rise of disruptive artificial intelligence (AI) technology, assuring autonomous systems is of the utmost importance. The drive to spread autonomous vehicles to all whether military or the commercial space is makes autonomous navigation a must for assurance. In this paper, we introduce the concept of using explainable AI to assure the operational autonomy of a vehicle while monitoring the security of the system. We demonstrate our paradigm by developing a system monitor using AI (i.e., Random Forest Tree algorithm) to assure the native autonomy of an autonomous Turtlebot3 and monitor security status of the Turtlebot3 computer system and sensor data. Then we dig into the decision trees of the AI algorithm and extract information to help explain the navigation autonomy and decisions made by our monitor. The explainability of the security monitor is not part of this experiment but the security monitor is useful for helping the autonomous navigation make decisions in the instance of attack. Further, we demonstrate the efficacy of the monitor by subjecting the Turtlebot3 to a ""Sharp Turn Maze"", which was designed to be hard to solve by the native autonomy, and a barrage of security attacks. These experiments allow the AI-Monitor to demonstrate its ability to identify and explain unproductive or wrong decisions made by the native autonomy and identify cyber-security related faults in order to trigger navigation contingencies.",2020-10-13,2020,Denzel Hamilton; Kevin Kornegay; Lanier Watkins,Morgan State University,,6,https://doi.org/10.1109/aipr50011.2020.9425292,Cybersecurity,Autonomy; Computer science; Computer security; Autonomous system (mathematics); Order (exchange),0.6
W3045500579,"THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SELECTIVE PASSENGER SCREENING SYSTEMS BASED ON DATA ANALYSIS AND BEHAVIORAL PROFILING IN THE SMART AVIATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT – CONDITIONS, CONSEQUENCES AND CONTROVERSIES","Since September 11, 2001, airport security control procedures have expanded in the face of the increased threat of terrorist attacks on aircrafts and airports.Obligatory and meticulous checks are carried out on all passengers although the overwhelming majority of passengers do not pose any risk.Current airport control procedures are expensive and inefficient; they extend the time spent by passengers at the airport and contribute to increased crowding; they inhibit the development of interconnected transport systems and significantly reduce the comfort of passengers who pose no threat.As the security needs of air transport morph, security experts are considering replacing the existing across-the-board procedures with personalized and more selective control processes based on data and behavioral analysis to reduce the duration of airport check-in procedures and improve the effectiveness of security controls.Such solutions have been successfully tested over the past decades at Israeli airports and check-in terminals by the Israeli state carrier El Al, which has the reputation of being the best-protected airline in the world.The FLYSEC system, developed and tested in 2015-2018 at Luxembourg Airport in cooperation with the local university, operates on similar principles although its implementation is less invasive.Modern computer tools for analyzing travel history data and data from current bookings as well as algorithmic methods of behavioral analysis based on advanced detection, identification, crowdsourcing and tracking systems all feed into such smart, selective and personalized security controls.Smart, selective control systems are based on the basic assumption that passengers can be accurately and effectively sorted into different risk groups (e.g.low-risk/trusted passengers, normal passengers, high-risk passengers), long before they arrive at the airport and create a real threat.There are many effective techniques for profiling and identifying perpetrators already used in criminology, criminalistics and computer forensics that are also suitable for use in smart security systems to better meet the current and future needs of civil air transport.The article presents the idea and general characteristics of smart, selective and personalized security control systems, followed by structuring of the analytical field and problem analysis in terms of their implementation conditions, opportunities, threats, conflict-forming potentials and controversies, as well as the needs for more detailed research and their suggested directions.",2020-06-30,2020,Krzysztof Michalski; Marcin Jurgilewicz; M S Kubiak; Anna Grądzka,Johns Hopkins University,Journal of Security and Sustainability Issues,7,https://doi.org/10.9770/jssi.2020.9.4(2),Cybersecurity,Profiling (computer programming); Airport security; Aviation; Computer security; Business,0.583
W3011182217,Privacy Violating Opensource Intelligence Threat Evaluation Framework: A Security Assessment Framework For Critical Infrastructure Owners,"Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the process of using tools and information to passively learn enough information about an organization to begin the cyber attack cycle. OSINT gathering is often the first step in a malicious cyber campaign. Social Media and the Internet (e.g., search engines, open source tools, blogs) are quickly becoming invaluable sources of information for malicious cyber actors. These two very popular forms of technology are notorious for inherently accumulating and archiving personal information about people, organizations, and networks. These technologies also give information perpetual life, which can be summoned at any time by those in possession of the right knowledge (i.e., Data Science) and tools to extract this information. We posit that the extent of these privacy violations have increased to the point where OSINT identified vulnerabilities may be as useful to attackers as zero-day vulnerabilities, since organizations are likely just as unaware of their presence. We refer to the tools and techniques used to identify these types of vulnerabilities as privacy violating OSINT (PV-OSINT). In this paper, we bring to light the very serious damage that can be done to critical infrastructure (CI), by the use of PV-OSINT. We tested our methodology with a real CI, we then shared our findings with the CI owner to verify the efficacy of our approach. Then we developed a framework that could be used by CI owners to constantly assess the security of their networks using PV-OSINT.",2020-01-01,2020,Adrian Cartagena; Gerald Rimmer; Thomas van Dalsen; Lanier Watkins; William H.

W3080383462,RUCKUS,"In 2016, the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) provided key foundations and motivations for navigating towards an autonomous cybersecurity approach. Since that time, novel strides have been made in the areas of static analysis, vulnerability discovery, patching, and exploit generation. However, a majority of these efforts have been focused on enterprise systems, leaving a gap in the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) domain. With the rise of connected infrastructure and the introduction of 5G communications, CPS are becoming more ingrained within present-day society. Due to a large amount of legacy software, and control of safety-critical actuation, CPS are and will continue to be a huge attack vector for our adversaries to remotely deploy devastating attacks against our country with low economic cost and at scale. To combat this threat, we propose the need to apply the most beneficial concepts from the CGC to create more secure and resilient CPS. In this paper, we introduce a CPS security assessment architecture RUCKUS for autonomously identifying and analyzing CPS firmware, identifying vulnerabilities, and developing exploits. Further, our approach considers how to integrate graph analytics to extrapolate findings to firmware at scale, allowing for measuring the potential widespread impact of attacks. Our architecture is demonstrated using an automotive case study, leveraging firmware from the most popular automotive and router manufacturers to assess the real-world potential impact of CPS attacks.",2020-08-26,2020,Bradley Potteiger; Jacob Mills; Daniel Cohen; Paul Velez,Johns Hopkins University,,3,https://doi.org/10.1145/3384217.3385622,Cybersecurity,Exploit; Firmware; Computer security; Computer science; Automotive industry,1.0
W4385730905,Novelty Detection in Network Traffic: Using Survival Analysis for Feature Identification,"Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are an important component of many organizations' cyber defense, resiliency and assurance strategies. However, one downside of these systems is their reliance on known attack signatures for detection of malicious network events. When it comes to unknown attack types and zero-day exploits, even modern machine learning based NIDS often fall short. In this paper, we introduce an unconventional approach to identifying network traffic features that influence novelty detection based on survival analysis techniques. Specifically, we combine several Cox proportional hazards models and implement Kaplan-Meier estimates to predict the probability that a classifier identifies novelty after the injection of an unknown network attack at any given time. The proposed model is successful at pinpointing PSH Flag Count, ACK Flag Count, URG Flag Count, and Down/Up Ratio as the main features to impact novelty detection via Random Forest, Bayesian Ridge, and Linear Support Vector Regression classifiers.",2023-06-01,2023,Taylor Bradley; Elie Alhajjar; Nathaniel D.

An attacker can exploit the off-nominal frequency operation of a power grid coupled with stability and tracking properties of an IBER PLL to manipulate the inverter and grid operations during strong and weak grid conditions. Employing a modified IEEE-14 bus system, simulation studies show that PLL-based attack can cause: (i) revenue losses to IBER operators in weak and strong grid conditions, (ii) voltage limit violations and voltage profile deterioration at IBER bus under weak grid condition, and (iii) system-wide power-angle instability under weak and strong grid conditions. To detect the PLL-based attack, we propose attack severity index (ASI) by generating a detection error signal from local grid voltage measurements and PLL estimation.

W4385187425,Understanding the (In)Security of Cross-side Face Verification Systems in Mobile Apps: A System Perspective,"Face Verification Systems (FVSes) are more and more deployed by real-world mobile applications (apps) to verify a human's claimed identity. One popular type of FVSes is called cross-side FVS (XFVS), which splits the FVS functionality into two sides: one at a mobile phone to take pictures or videos and the other at a trusted server for verification. Prior works have studied the security of XFVSes from the machine learning perspective, i.e., whether the learning models used by XFVSes are robust to adversarial attacks. However, the security of other parts of XFVSes, especially the design and implementation of the verification procedure used by XFVSes, is not well understood.In this paper, we conduct the first measurement study on the security of real-world XFVSes used by popular mobile apps from a system perspective. More specifically, we design and implement a semi-automated system, called XFVSChecker, to detect XFVSes in mobile apps and then inspect their compliance with four security properties. Our evaluation reveals that most of existing XFVS apps, including those with billions of downloads, are vulnerable to at least one of four types of attacks. These attacks require only easily available attack prerequisites, such as one photo of the victim, to pose significant security risks, including complete account takeover, identity fraud and financial loss.

Cloud-based office systems increase the attack surface and do not mitigate the effects of breaches that can result in theft of credentials. Although employee education is often recommended to avoid the threats, a single error by a single employee has often led to security breaches, and it is unreasonable to expect that no employee will ever make an error. Recognition of the 2 most common vectors of these breaches-compromised email attachments and surfing to compromised websites-allows the use of technical networking tools to prevent both email attachments from being received and employee use of unsanctioned and potentially compromised websites. Furthermore, once compromised code has been allowed to run within the office network, that code must necessarily make outbound connections to exploit the breach. Preventing that outbound traffic can mitigate the effects of a breach. However, most small office network consultants design firewalls to only limit incoming network traffic and fail to implement technical measures to stop the unauthorized outbound traffic that is necessary for most network attacks. The authors provide detailed techniques that can be used to direct information technology consultants to properly limit outbound network traffic as well as incoming email attachments.",2023-05-22,2023,James M.

W3033350628,Considering the potential for an increase in chronic pain after the COVID-19 pandemic,"1. Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the lives and health of persons worldwide, with potential for further effects in the future. The experience of living within this pandemic has disrupted daily life across all sectors, including those living with chronic pain (CP), those infected with the coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV2, healthcare providers and essential workers, as well as those who remained physically healthy. The toll of this pandemic extends beyond physical illness, with important psychosocial stressors that include prolonged periods of limited interpersonal contact, isolation, fear of illness, future uncertainty, and financial strain. Uncertainty is fuelled by the constant media coverage, often with conflicting information, differing recommendations by public health authorities in different jurisdictions, and the unknown duration and likelihood of resurgence of this pandemic. In this context, we will examine the potential health consequences of COVID-19 germane to CP, which might be nociplastic, neuropathic, or nociceptive. Specific possibilities might include: (1) CP as part of a postviral syndrome or the result of viral-associated organ damage; (2) worsening of CP due to exacerbation of preexisting pain physical or mental complaints; and (3) CP newly triggered in individuals not infected with COVID by exacerbation of risk factors (poor sleep, inactivity, fear, anxiety, and depression). Chronic pain must be considered in the context of the biopsychosocial model, which views symptoms as the result of a complex and dynamic interaction between biological, psychological, and social factors.36,39 Underlying predisposing mechanisms include genetic factors, previous pain experience, and traumatic events that could be physical or emotional.2 Chronic pain conditions can be triggered by psychosocial stressors or organ-specific biological factors, which may preferentially occur in individuals with a fragile stress response system.8,10,24,40,47 The COVID-19 pandemic has many characteristics that could potentially increase the prevalence of CP, especially with stressors extending over many months. The worldwide pain community is invited to consider the possible downstream consequences of COVID-19, not only for patients surviving infection, but also for the wider community that has experienced psychological, social, and economic effects. Although we address these issues from the perspective of physicians practicing in developed countries, many of the consequences discussed will be particularly relevant for people in other countries, with a call for colleagues in Asia, Africa, and South America to enter into this dialogue. 2. Infections as a trigger for chronic pain Acute viral illnesses often present with myalgia and fatigue, as well as organ-specific symptoms, as seen with influenza, and noted in the H1N1 pandemics of 1918 and 2009, and coronavirus infection during the SARS epidemic.4,17 Outcomes related to these infections are almost always focused on the immediate response to the acute illness, with little attention to long-term outcomes. In a small study of 22 subjects (21 of whom were healthcare workers) infected during the SARS epidemic, a chronic post-SARS syndrome consisting of fatigue, diffuse myalgia, depression, and nonrestorative sleep persisted for almost 2 years.27 Similarly, some patients with chronic widespread pain report onset of symptoms after a perceived viral illness. Although some infections cause specific postinfectious syndromes, there is also a common stereotypical response to any type of infection that is often observed. For example, up to 12% of patients infected with 3 different pathogens, ie, Ross River virus (the cause of epidemic polyarthritis), Coxiella burnetii (cause of Q fever), and Epstein–Barr virus, experienced a postviral syndrome of pain, fatigue, and memory difficulties for up to 12 months after infection.15 Although these infections have markedly disparate acute presentations, a stereotypical chronic syndrome occurred at remarkably similar rates and was not predicted by demographic, psychological/psychiatric measures, or microbiological factors.15 The presence and severity of somatic symptoms during acute infection was closely correlated with the subsequent development of chronic fatigue and pain. Chronic regional pain and other somatic symptoms can follow other types of acute infection. In a meta-analysis, Halvorson et al. noted that approximately 10% of individuals will develop postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome after an episode of acute viral or bacterial gastroenteritis, with premorbid psychological problems and/or psychosocial stressors recognized as risk factors.7,13 On a similar note, an episode of acute urinary tract infection is evident in a substantial proportion of women who develop interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome.43 Collectively, these findings imply that various acute infections are capable of triggering both widespread and regional CP. The evidence also suggests that the inciting infection must be of sufficient severity and duration to disrupt normal activities.44 Current estimates are that 80% of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients have mild to moderate disease, including both pneumonia and nonpneumonia cases, 13.8% have severe disease, and 6.1% develop critical illness requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission.42 3. Potential health-related consequences of COVID-19 3.1. Chronic pain as a consequence of COVID-19 disease Persons with COVID-19 may exhibit a broad range of symptoms, beginning with those who are asymptomatic and extending to patients who develop full-blown severe respiratory distress syndrome. Nonspecific constitutional symptoms include fatigue, myalgias, chills, and headaches. Most patients experience symptoms for 1 to 2 weeks with complete resolution, although some require hospitalization. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is on the order of 1% according to estimates published by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.37 Whether patients with CP are more susceptible to viral infection or the consequences thereof is unknown. Theoretically, the diminished immune response system observed in CP patients could be even further suppressed by factors such as depression, poor sleep, and opioid use, with potential to increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV2.19,41 Many individuals with COVID need ICU care, and individuals surviving an illness requiring ICU admission are at increased risk of long-lasting severe functional limitations, psychological distress, and CP. Surveys have reported persistent CP in 38% to 56% of ICU survivors when evaluated 2 to 4 years after ICU admission.18,34 Quality of life can also be affected for prolonged periods. In a study evaluating 575 patients 6 to 11 years after ICU discharge, many experienced persistent difficulty with mobility (52%), self-care (19%), activities of daily living (52%), pain/discomfort (57%), and cognition (43%).38 Mental health is also frequently affected by severe illness. Between 41% and 65% of SARS survivors have experienced persistent psychological symptoms.20,23 Between 25% and 44% of Hong Kong residents who were infected with SARS and survived were diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 15% experienced depression for at least 30 months after the illness.16,22 Posttraumatic stress disorder also occurred in 40.7% of SARS-infected healthcare workers.22 3.2. Exacerbation of chronic pain in the absence of actual infection Some CP patients may experience exacerbation of symptoms resulting from COVID-19 due to both public health and personal issues. Regular medical care may be compromised during lockdown and the ensuing months.9 Routine clinics may be less accessible or closed, healthcare professionals may be diverted to COVID-19-related activities, and waiting times may be prolonged, especially for medical illnesses such as CP that many consider nonurgent. Patients may be less able or willing to travel for care, or may be fearful of exposure to infection in a public or medical setting. There may be delays in timely access to medications due to reduced prescribing, as well as to pain management procedures considered to be of lesser importance than the care of patients with more urgent illnesses. Reduced clinical encounters with interdisciplinary healthcare team members (eg, physiotherapists, psychologists, and self-help groups) can have adverse consequences. Access to medications may be reduced due to logistical factors or true drug shortages when analgesic medications are diverted to emergency care causing some to turn to alcohol or nonmedically prescribed substances as a desperate measure to relieve poorly managed pain. The rapid evolution of telehealth presents new challenges for clinical care, especially for those not fully comfortable with or without access to digital technology. The economic impact on public health is evident for working patients who may have lost jobs or health insurance and must contend with financial insecurity or even poverty. Another factor to consider is reduced health-related physical activities, which are a vital management strategy for CP, that result from social distancing and isolation, and closure of group activity programs such as gyms and pools.21 Limited social support will also contribute to poor psychological health.12 Patients may have a heightened awareness of physical symptoms accompanied by fear that these symptoms are an indication of infection. These numerous and persistent stressors may exacerbate pain, even in the absence of viral illness. Given these factors, common wisdom might suggest that catastrophic and stressful events such as COVID-19 will inevitably lead to an exacerbation of CP. However, 2 studies performed in the United States just before and after the 9/11 terrorist attacks indicate that not all psychological stressors will trigger or exacerbate CP. Pain complaints and other somatic symptoms did not change among residents of New York and New Jersey who had been surveyed before and after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.32 Similarly, pain complaints did not change for patients with fibromyalgia in the Washington, D.C. region during the same period.32 Daily ""hassles"" and personally relevant stressors seem to be more likely to cause symptoms than major catastrophic events that do not personally impact the individual.30 Therefore, the duration of the stress (ie, weeks to months of lockdown in the current pandemic), and the vocational uncertainty and actual loss of jobs, may adversely affecting health outcomes. Reviews that highlight the role that various catastrophic events have on health suggest a number of factors that may be more important than the intensity of the ""stressor"" in predicting adverse health outcomes. Female sex, concerns about or the expectation of chronicity, and inactivity or time off work can all trigger pain and other somatic symptoms.26 Naturally occurring catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, or fires seem less likely to lead to chronic somatic symptoms than similarly ""man-made"" stressful events such as chemical spills or war.6 Exposure to a multitude of stressors simultaneously, or over time, may also pose significant risk for later somatic and/or psychological sequelae.14,33 For example, in military personnel, multiple deployments significantly increase the risk for PTSD and other psychiatric conditions, which in turn are highly coprevalent with CP.46 3.3. New onset of chronic pain related to psychological stressors It is not currently known whether COVID-19 will cause an increase in new-onset CP for the population at large. Risk factors for the longitudinal development of CP have been well studied in fibromyalgia and temporomandibular disorders.11,25,29 Although CP conditions are thought by some to be highly related to stress and distress, studies have consistently shown that high baseline levels of psychological distress are only modestly related to the development of chronic regional or widespread pain (OR 1.5-2).25 Regional CP, female sex, and low socioeconomic status are the strongest predictors for the subsequent development of widespread pain.11,25 Other factors that may contribute to an increase in CP are poor sleep and reduced physical activity. Sleep deprivation can lead to symptoms virtually indistinguishable from widespread pain, fatigue, and diffuse tenderness.28 Furthermore, the effects of sleep deprivation may be attenuated by physical activity (ie, individuals who remain physically active may be less sensitive to the effects of sleep disruption).1 Healthcare workers may be at increased risk for development of CP. In a recent Israeli study, 9.7% of a cohort of 206 nurses fulfilled criteria for fibromyalgia, with symptoms strongly correlated with work-related stress and PTSD-related symptoms.3 Numerous factors contribute to high stress levels across geographic boundaries. Nearly everyone is exposed to relentless media coverage and conflicting messages, and concerns about contracting SARS-CoV2, routine medical care, family, jobs, and economic issues are pervasive. Those with an underlying mental health disorder are at particular risk for exacerbation. Further stressors relate to social distancing, isolation and quarantine, and in some, grieving a death without the usual social support system. Persistent and extreme stress can lead to severe mental health consequences including an increased suicide rate. There is preliminary evidence that anxiety and depression (16%-28%), self-reported stress (8%), and sleep disturbances are common reactions to this pandemic.31 During the SARS outbreak in 2003, an historically high suicide rate of 18.6 per 100,000 was reported in Hong Kong.5 Furthermore, the annual suicide rate in older adults after the SARS epidemic did not return to preepidemic levels, suggesting that factors related to the epidemic had long-term consequences. 4. Immediate consequences of COVID-19 and strategies to mitigate these effects Recovery from a life-threatening illness can be expected to affect future physical and mental health. Rehabilitation services should be mobilized for both inpatient and outpatient care, with attention paid to staffing issues to ensure access to psychological services, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy.35 Routine medical care will resume for most patients, and healthcare professionals should be flexible and willing to adapt to new methods of healthcare delivery, especially with regard to telemedicine.9 Healthcare workers must also adapt to different methods of communicating with colleagues and an increased emphasis on virtual learning and teaching. Those working in mental health must be attuned to the consequences of economic hardship, which could include increased substance abuse, domestic violence, and suicide. Providers working in low- and middle-income countries are particularly disadvantaged by limited healthcare resources and a shortage of healthcare workers.45 Developed countries should recognize that healthcare crises in underdeveloped countries are constrained by artificial boundaries and continue to participate in efforts led by international organizations such the World Health Organization and International Red Cross. These suggestions can only be implemented if governments and legislators are willing to work in partnership with the healthcare community in accordance with the recommendations of experts. 5. Conclusion In this unprecedented crisis, the immediate healthcare concerns are directed towards containment and acute patient care. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health will likely be manifested in both infected individuals and in people spared infection, but are nevertheless adversely affected by disruptions in normal life and experience a wide array of physical, psychological, and social stressors. Based on past experience, we postulate that these scenarios may collectively lead to an increase in CP in the immediate and possibly long-term future. Amidst many uncertainties, the research community is urged to study, devise, and implement strategies aimed at mitigating the pain-related health consequences of this pandemic. Some suggestions could include the establishment of registries of infected patients (including those with concomitant CP), designated COVID-19-related clinics to ensure new and follow-up care for infected persons, examination of telehealth as a means of delivering health care, and population surveys to gather public health information related to COVID-19. Epidemiological data should be used to inform future healthcare policies that seek to reduce the magnitude of future epidemics and their myriad consequences on CP and other diseases. The timely recognition of new CP or exacerbations of preexisting CP, prompt and targeted treatment, and strategies to mitigate the potential impact on health are strongly encouraged.

W4297841898,AdvEst: Adversarial Perturbation Estimation to Classify and Detect Adversarial Attacks against Speaker Identification,"Adversarial attacks pose a severe security threat to the state-ofthe-art speaker identification systems, thereby making it vital to propose countermeasures against them.Building on our previous work that used representation learning to classify and detect adversarial attacks, we propose an improvement to it using Ad-vEst, a method to estimate adversarial perturbation.First, we prove our claim that training the representation learning network using adversarial perturbations as opposed to adversarial examples (consisting of the combination of clean signal and adversarial perturbation) is beneficial because it eliminates nuisance information.At inference time, we use a time-domain denoiser to estimate the adversarial perturbations from adversarial examples.Using our improved representation learning approach to obtain attack embeddings (signatures), we evaluate their performance for three applications: known attack classification, attack verification, and unknown attack detection.We show that common attacks in the literature (Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Carlini-Wagner (CW) with different Lp threat models) can be classified with an accuracy of ∼ 96%.We also detect unknown attacks with an equal error rate (EER) of ∼9%, which is absolute improvement of ∼12% from our previous work.",2022-09-16,2022,Sonal Joshi; Saurabh Kataria; Jesús Villalba; Najim Dehak,Johns Hopkins University,Interspeech 2022,4,https://doi.org/10.21437/interspeech.2022-10985,Cybersecurity,Adversarial system; Computer science; Speaker identification; Speech recognition; Identification (biology),0.508
W4210798802,Compact and Flexible KEM From Ideal Lattice,"A remarkable breakthrough in mathematics in recent years is the proof of the long-standing conjecture: sphere packing in the <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$E_{8}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> lattice is optimal in the sense of the best density for sphere packing in <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathbb {R}^{8}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> . In this work, we design a mechanism for asymmetric key consensus from noise (AKCN), referred to as AKCN-E8, for error correction and key consensus. As a direct application, we present a practical key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) from the ideal lattice based on the ring learning with errors (RLWE) problem. Compared with NewHope-KEM that was the second round candidate of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization, our AKCN-E8 KEM scheme overcomes some limitations and shortcomings of NewHope-KEM. Compared with some other dominating KEM schemes based on the variants of LWE, specifically Kyber and Saber, AKCN-E8 has a comparable performance but enjoys much flexible shared-key sizes. Specifically, the key encapsulated by AKCN-E8-512 (resp., 768, 1024) has the size of 256 (resp., 384, 512) bits. Flexible key size renders us stronger security against quantum attacks, more powerful and economic ability of key transportation, and better matches the demand in interactive protocols like TLS where parties need to negotiate the security parameters including the shared key length.",2022-02-01,2022,Zhengzhong Jin; Shiyu Shen; Yunlei Zhao,Fudan University,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,4,https://doi.org/10.1109/tit.2022.3148586,Cybersecurity,Learning with errors; Notation; Key encapsulation; Lattice (music); NIST,0.508
W3046558582,JSKernel: Fortifying JavaScript against Web Concurrency Attacks via a Kernel-Like Structure,"As portals to the Internet, web browsers constitute prominent targets for attacks. Existing defenses that redefine web APIs typically capture information related to a single JavaScript function. Thus, they fail to defend against the so-called web concurrency attacks that use multiple interleaved functions to trigger a browser vulnerability. In this paper, we propose JSKernel, the first generic framework that introduces a kernel concept into JavaScript to defend against web concurrency attacks. The JavaScript kernel, inspired from operating system concepts, enforces the execution order of JavaScript events and threads to fortify security. We implement a prototype of JSKernel deployable as add-on extensions to three widely used web browsers, namely Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. These open-source extensions are available at (https://github.com/jskernel2019/jskernel) along with a usability demo at (https://jskernel2019.github.io/).

W4376606435,Slipping Through Attackers' Fingers: Fast Neutron Communications for Space Cybersecurity,"Multi-agent space systems are inherently promiscuous. Blasting radio signals to each other within a constellation or to a ground station, it is simple for adversaries to disrupt the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the communication. With increasing rendezvous proximity operations (RPO) capabilities, the communication security of multi-agent space systems - be they configured as co-orbital, in constellations or other topology, is vulnerable to attackers. Optical communications offer several security benefits compared to radiofrequency (RF) communications, but are fragile and easily disrupted given the precision required to point a laser into a small receptacle while satellites are flying at 11,300 kph. We propose engaging the nascent technique of communicating using fast neutrons for secure, out-of-band, multi-agent space communications. Fast neutrons offer unique physics-based security properties such as their the ability to penetrate materials and be difficult to intercept. Using attack trees, we conduct a comparative analysis across RF, optical and neutron communications to evaluate the difficulty to achieve an RPO-based eavesdropping mission. We demonstrate that fast neutron communications would be more secure than other multi-agent space communication modalities, should the technology be further developed and deployed on a spacecraft. Fast neutrons would literally slip through adversaries' fingers.",2023-03-04,2023,Damiano Marsili; Nicolò Boschetti; Nathaniel G.

W4366258754,Explainable Autonomic Cybersecurity For Industrial Control Systems,"Industrial Control System (ICS) networks are the most targeted systems by attackers in the world, because they are the life-blood of any country's Critical Infrastructure. In this work-in-progress paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based (decision trees) intrusion detection system for ICS networks inspired by the principals of autonomic cybersecurity with the addition of explainability. Since autonomic systems are autonomous and can be preventative (i.e., active) by nature, the added benefit of explainability helps to better establish human trust in an era where human confidence in artificial intelligence (AI) is low. In the spirit of full transparency, we clearly explain our methodology, data collection, feature development, model training and testing, and results. Our resulting models achieved an accuracy of over 95%, and we also illustrate how information can be extracted from the nodes in the decision trees to clearly explain how our models arrived at their decisions.",2023-03-08,2023,V L Manoj; Shao Wenda; Niu Sihan; Christopher Rouff; Lanier Watkins,Johns Hopkins University,2022 IEEE 12th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC),2,https://doi.org/10.1109/ccwc57344.2023.10099307,Cybersecurity,Industrial control system; Computer science; Intrusion detection system; Transparency (behavior); Computer security,0.867
W4392389606,MaDEVIoT: Cyberattacks on EV Charging Can Disrupt Power Grid Operation,"This paper examines the feasibility of demand-side cyberattacks on power grids launched via internet-connected high-power EV Charging Stations (EVCSs). By distorting power grid frequency and voltage, these attacks can trigger system-wide outages. Our case study focuses on Manhattan, New York, and reveals that such attacks will become feasible by 2030 with increased EV adoption. With a single EVCS company dominating Manhattan, compromising a single EVCS server raises serious power grid security concerns. These attacks can overload power lines and trip over-frequency (OF) protection relays, resulting in a power grid blackout. This study serves as a crucial resource for planning authorities and power grid operators involved in the EV charging infrastructure roll-out, highlighting potential cyberthreats to power grids stemming from high-power EVCSs.",2024-02-19,2024,Samrat Acharya; Hafiz Anwar Ullah Khan; Ramesh Karri; Yury Dvorkin,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,,5,https://doi.org/10.1109/isgt59692.2024.10454199,Cybersecurity,Computer science; Power grid; Grid; Power (physics); Smart grid,0.508

W3089862415,Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in Mental Health: Systematic Review,"Background Machine learning systems are part of the field of artificial intelligence that automatically learn models from data to make better decisions. Natural language processing (NLP), by using corpora and learning approaches, provides good performance in statistical tasks, such as text classification or sentiment mining. Objective The primary aim of this systematic review was to summarize and characterize, in methodological and technical terms, studies that used machine learning and NLP techniques for mental health. The secondary aim was to consider the potential use of these methods in mental health clinical practice Methods This systematic review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; number CRD42019107376). The search was conducted using 4 medical databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO) with the following keywords: machine learning, data mining, psychiatry, mental health, and mental disorder. The exclusion criteria were as follows: languages other than English, anonymization process, case studies, conference papers, and reviews. No limitations on publication dates were imposed. Results A total of 327 articles were identified, of which 269 (82.3%) were excluded and 58 (17.7%) were included in the review. The results were organized through a qualitative perspective. Although studies had heterogeneous topics and methods, some themes emerged. Population studies could be grouped into 3 categories: patients included in medical databases, patients who came to the emergency room, and social media users. The main objectives were to extract symptoms, classify severity of illness, compare therapy effectiveness, provide psychopathological clues, and challenge the current nosography. Medical records and social media were the 2 major data sources. With regard to the methods used, preprocessing used the standard methods of NLP and unique identifier extraction dedicated to medical texts. Efficient classifiers were preferred rather than transparent functioning classifiers. Python was the most frequently used platform. Conclusions Machine learning and NLP models have been highly topical issues in medicine in recent years and may be considered a new paradigm in medical research. However, these processes tend to confirm clinical hypotheses rather than developing entirely new information, and only one major category of the population (ie, social media users) is an imprecise cohort. Moreover, some language-specific features can improve the performance of NLP methods, and their extension to other languages should be more closely investigated. However, machine learning and NLP techniques provide useful information from unexplored data (ie, patients’ daily habits that are usually inaccessible to care providers). Before considering It as an additional tool of mental health care, ethical issues remain and should be discussed in a timely manner. Machine learning and NLP methods may offer multiple perspectives in mental health research but should also be considered as tools to support clinical practice.",2020-10-02,2020,Aziliz Le Glaz; Yannis Haralambous; Deok-Hee Kim-Dufor; Philippe Lenca; Romain Billot,Hôpital de l'Antiquaille,Journal of Medical Internet Research,412,https://doi.org/10.2196/15708,AI_Machine_Learning,PsycINFO; Systematic review; Mental health; Scopus; Artificial intelligence,0.7
W3184954410,Artificial intelligence-assisted tools for redefining the communication landscape of the scholarly world,"The flood of research output and increasing demands for peer reviewers have necessitated the intervention of artificial intelligence (AI) in scholarly publishing. Although human input is seen as essential for writing publications, the contribution of AI slowly and steadily moves ahead. AI may redefine the role of science communication experts in the future and transform the scholarly publishing industry into a technology-driven one. It can prospectively improve the quality of publishable content and identify errors in published content. In this article, we review various AI and other associated tools currently in use or development for a range of publishing obligations and functions that have brought about or can soon leverage much-demanded advances in scholarly communications. Several AI-assisted tools, with diverse scope and scale, have emerged in the scholarly market. AI algorithms develop summaries of scientific publications and convert them into plain-language texts, press statements, and news stories. Retrieval of accurate and sufficient information is prominent in evidence-based science publications. Semantic tools may empower transparent and proficient data extraction tactics. From detecting simple plagiarism errors to predicting the projected citation impact of an unpublished article, AI’s role in scholarly publishing is expected to be multidimensional. AI, natural language processing, and machine learning in scholarly publishing have arrived for writers, editors, authors, and publishers.

W4206900330,Translatability Analysis of National Institutes of Health–Funded Biomedical Research That Applies Artificial Intelligence,"Despite the rapid growth of interest and diversity in applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to biomedical research, there are limited objective ways to characterize the potential for use of AI in clinical practice.To examine what types of medical AI have the greatest estimated translational impact (ie, ability to lead to development that has measurable value for human health) potential.In this cohort study, research grants related to AI awarded between January 1, 1985, and December 31, 2020, were identified from a National Institutes of Health (NIH) award database. The text content for each award was entered into a Natural Language Processing (NLP) clustering algorithm. An NIH database was also used to extract citation data, including the number of citations and approximate potential to translate (APT) score for published articles associated with the granted awards to create proxies for translatability.Unsupervised assignment of AI-related research awards to application topics using NLP.Annualized citations per $1 million funding (ACOF) and average APT score for award-associated articles, grouped by application topic. The APT score is a machine-learning based metric created by the NIH Office of Portfolio Analysis that quantifies the likelihood of future citation by a clinical article.A total of 16 629 NIH awards related to AI were included in the analysis, and 75 applications of AI were identified. Total annual funding for AI grew from $17.4 million in 1985 to $1.43 billion in 2020. By average APT, interpersonal communication technologies (0.488; 95% CI, 0.472-0.504) and population genetics (0.463; 95% CI, 0.453-0.472) had the highest translatability; environmental health (ACOF, 1038) and applications focused on the electronic health record (ACOF, 489) also had high translatability. The category of applications related to biochemical analysis was found to have low translatability by both metrics (average APT, 0.393; 95% CI, 0.388-0.398; ACOF, 246).Based on this study's findings, data on grants from the NIH can apparently be used to identify and characterize medical applications of AI to understand changes in academic productivity, funding support, and potential for translational impact.

W4401829593,"Utility of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Artificial Intelligence in Predicting Hospital Readmissions After Orthopaedic Surgery","Background: Numerous applications and strategies have been utilized to help assess the trends and patterns of readmissions after orthopaedic surgery in an attempt to extrapolate possible risk factors and causative agents. The aim of this work is to systematically summarize the available literature on the extent to which natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) can help improve the predictability of hospital readmissions after orthopaedic and spine surgeries. Methods: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar were searched, up until August 30, 2023, for studies that explore the use of AI, natural language processing, and machine learning tools for the prediction of readmission rates after orthopedic procedures. Data regarding surgery type, patient population, readmission outcomes, advanced models utilized, comparison methods, predictor sets, the inclusion of perioperative predictors, validation method, size of training and testing sample, accuracy, and receiver operating characteristics (C-statistic), among other factors, were extracted and assessed. Results: A total of 26 studies were included in our final dataset. The overall summary C-statistic showed a mean of 0.71 across all models, indicating a reasonable level of predictiveness. A total of 15 articles (57%) were attributed to the spine, making it the most commonly explored orthopaedic field in our study. When comparing accuracy of prediction models between different fields, models predicting readmissions after hip/knee arthroplasty procedures had a higher prediction accuracy (mean C-statistic = 0.79) than spine (mean C-statistic = 0.7) and shoulder (mean C-statistic = 0.67). In addition, models that used single institution data, and those that included intraoperative and/or postoperative outcomes, had a higher mean C-statistic than those utilizing other data sources, and that include only preoperative predictors. According to the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool, the majority of the articles in our study had a high risk of bias. Conclusion: AI tools perform reasonably well in predicting readmissions after orthopaedic procedures. Future work should focus on standardizing study methodologies and designs, and improving the data analysis process, in an attempt to produce more reliable and tangible results.

W4311973817,Artificial Intelligence Tools to Evaluate Language and Speech Patterns in Alzheimer's Disease,"Speech and language problems are one of the earliest signs of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), but they are often difficult to detect especially in the early stages. Utility of assessing speech and language problems using artificial intelligence (AI) has been examined in the past. However, the accuracy of different methods has been variable, preventing incorporation of these techniques in clinical use. In this study, we present different speech-based machine learning techniques. We focused on the automatic extraction of a wide array of interpretable features from the speech signals, then compared these features across different neurological disorders.Spoken responses to four different tasks (i.e., Cookie Theft Picture (CTP) and Stroop Task) were recorded from 80 participants, 5 with AD, 28 with Parkinson's disease (PD), 18 normal controls (NCs), and the remaining with other neurological diseases (OTRs). We automatically extracted several acoustic and linguistic features using speech and language technologies. We conducted pairwise Kruskal-Wallis tests to assess how speech and language abilities differed between different neurodegenerative disease vs. control groups. We used SciPy Python library.The total amount of speech time and pauses as well as the average duration and the variance of the number pauses significantly differed between AD and NC and between PD and NC in almost every task (p <0.05). Prosodic features based on F0 contour and F0 on the first and last voiced segment resulted in significant differences across tasks between AD and NC, AD and PD, AD and OTR (p <0.05). The phonological posterior for the phonological classes of consonantal, voiced, labial, nasal, velar, trill, and close significantly differed in almost every task between AD and NC, AD and PD and AD and OTR (p <0.05). Moreover, from the transcriptions of the CTP task, the number of sentences and noun phrases differed significantly between AD and NC, whereas the number of contrastive connectives and the moving average type-token ratio were significant between NC and OTR (p <0.05).Automated analysis of speech employing machine learning techniques can provide objective assessment of patients with AD that may be useful in distinguishing AD from other neurological disorders.",2022-12-01,2022,Anna Favaro; Seneca Motley; Quincy M.

W4396853285,Connecting the Unconnected,"Connecting the Unconnected or under-connected (CTU) is the holy grail of transforming the lives of over 3 billion people around the globe with wireless internet who are yet to experience its value in multiple ways. If this could be accomplished, its impact on the society would be enormous as everyone would have access to information and an opportunity to improve their quality of life and income. This chapter from the IEEE Future Networks CTU Working Group endeavors to highlight the need to consider the CTU requirements in 5G and B5G networks in the standardization process and in the development of the use cases and affordable solutions. In its Vision 2030 SDG (Sustainability Development Goals) the United Nations has proclaimed access to internet as basic human right and has said these goals cannot be achieved without affordable access to internet by everyone on this planet[65]. While there are numerous projects and initiatives ongoing around the world, these are fragmented and lack the critical mass and coordination to be able to impact the future standards, product development, and cost of deployment otherwise achievable by economy of scale. Although difficult to pin down, to define a threshold for basic connectivity for all is important. But it would need to be flexible to adapt to changing times. It is the goal of the CTU group to create an open platform where the experts can bring their ideas, solutions, and potentially collaborate to create large global projects and influence the network service providers, manufacturers and their governments. This paper defines the CTU working group's charter, scope, and provides a brief overview of the relevant stakeholders and linkages between them. Then the paper goes into the current status of the CTU landscape and where we want to reach to accomplish the vision of connecting everybody, especially those living in rural and remote areas. We present the various standards and industry fora and how they are interlinked. While technologies are available today, they need to be customized and optimized at the systems level to bring down the cost of the network to be affordable. In addition, the content needs to be relevant and in local languages to be useful, not to mention the need to offer innovative human computer interaction (HCI) solutions (that are not text based) so that people who are not literate or are digitally disadvantaged can easily use the devices and consume services. Another important area is that of flexible spectrum allocation regime at the lower range of the spectrum to increase reach and coverage. Use of renewable energy sources will enable deployment in remote areas where there is lack of power grid, or it is intermittent. Thus, this paper identifies a number of technology gaps to be filled in by 5G and B5G networks, such that access is affordable and content and services are actually consumed by the targeted set of users. Although hitherto unexplored, artificial intelligence (AI) an machine learning (ML) have tremendous role to play for serving the rural and remote communities both to deliver the most needed services and to customize them to the digital capacity of the end users. Technology aside, the need to develop innovative business models is a must to be commercially sustainable in the long-term. A number of such models, especially designed for the rural population, are proposed, such as Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE) Freemium (Free + Premium), revenue sharing among the chain of service providers, subsidized billing by USOF (Universal Service Obligation Funds). Finally, the paper presents a 10-year roadmap starting from the current state to three years, five years, and ten years.",2023-11-13,2023,Sudhir Dixit; Ashutosh Dutta; Sandeep Agrawal; Marvin R.

W4392157509,Artificial intelligence and technology collaboratories: Empowering innovation in <scp>AI</scp> + <scp>AgeTech</scp>,"Launched in September 2021, the Artificial Intelligence and Technology Collaboratories (AITC) for Aging Research program is the newest of the seven centers programs funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and is dedicated to helping Americans live longer, healthier lives through the application of AI and emerging technologies (Figure 1). Three collaboratories, centered at Johns Hopkins University (JH AITC), the University of Massachusetts Amherst (MassAITC), and the University of Pennsylvania (PennAITech), and a Coordinating Center managed by Rose Li & Associates Inc. (RLA) comprise the ""a2 Collective."" By committing more than $65 million over 5 years toward this program, NIA amplified the promise of technology, and AI in particular, to accelerate the development of solutions to help Americans, especially those with dementia, live where they most want: in their homes.1 NIA relies on proven tactics for the greatest impact: bringing together multiple disciplines to tackle societal challenges, cultivating timely data sharing where possible, identifying and enticing top talent in varied fields to focus on aging, and orchestrating a harmonized approach from the start, with national scope, to give the program staying power in a fast-evolving AgeTech ecosystem. NIA earmarked $40 million over 5 years for the a2 Collective to hold annual pilot award competitions. Our first three calls for applications drew nearly 700 applications from 45 states plus Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A significant majority (71%) of the initial 60 awardees (from two competitions) include academic collaborators, reflecting the premium placed on research rigor (Figure 2). More than 40% of pilots are led by women, and about three-quarters relate to dementia. Specific examples include a machine learning-enabled, speech-based dementia screening tool for families and caregivers and a simple imaging and telemedicine system for remote eye (cataract) screening in disadvantaged populations by non-ophthalmologists. (See additional funded pilot descriptions at https://www.a2collective.ai/awardees.) Most pilot projects are developing or beta testing prototypes (60%) and evaluating prototypes in real-world conditions (30%); fewer are at the technology concept or discovery stage (7%) or pursuing commercial deployment or scaling up (3%). About 80% of funded pilots involve machine learning (ML) and significant proportions are developing user-facing software and platforms, wearables, smart household devices or utilities, and environmental sensors. Pilot awards to date were selected from an application pool constituted before the advent of widespread public engagement with powerful large language models (LLMs) at the end of 2022. Given the many LLMs now available, future calls are expected to see a dramatic increase in the number of projects building on generative AI and LLMs. The landscape is becoming saturated with technologies and platforms with overlapping functions. Comparative effectiveness research is increasingly needed to facilitate inevitable consolidation in the field. In the meantime, we need to continue to identify and support the most innovative technology and partnerships, invest in projects that take calculated risks and employ ethical AI design, pursue practical product-development goals, and demonstrate an understanding of the user experience and integration into clinical practice. Almost all awarded pilots are collecting human subjects data, but generally in small numbers. Giving more weight to projects that access large datasets (e.g., through academic research institutions, industry, or payers) and prioritizing the completeness of data will accelerate the development of more sophisticated, inclusive AI/ML methods. The pace of AI evolution may simply be too rapid for our pilot projects to reflect the current research frontier in real time. Reducing the time to project launch would help our pilots more nimbly respond to fast-changing developments.

W4400778756,Embracing Real AI: A call to action for medical physicists in healthcare,"The article ""Embracing Real AI: A Call to Action for Medical Physicists in Healthcare"" urges medical physicists to prepare for the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare practices, emphasizing their pivotal role in adapting to technological advancements. The authors advocate for embracing AI through advocacy, broadening perspectives, and enhancing coordination and communication. They propose an ABC strategy focusing on increasing educational initiatives, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and creating team collaboration to facilitate AI integration. The commentary highlights AI's potential in enhancing diagnostics, personalizing medicine, and automating routine tasks while addressing challenges such as data sharing and the role of federated learning. The article calls for medical physicists to lead in embracing AI, emphasizing continuous learning and collaboration to leverage its potential for improving healthcare and patient care. Medical physicists have consistently demonstrated strong interest in developing proficiency in the adoption of new technological advancements. The roots of the profession come from the radiation sciences, including radiation protection, radiation therapy, diagnostic imaging, and nuclear medicine.1 As science and technology continued to evolve, medical physicists' roles have extended into other non-radiation domains, such as non-ionizing-radiation-based imaging (ultrasound and magnetic resonance), molecular imaging, computer aided diagnosis (CAD), information technologies, and data science.2 In addition, medical physicists gradually have adopted increasingly more active roles in ensuring the professional education of other radiology/radiation oncology team members, maintaining high quality standards via quality assurance (QA) methods. They also play a major role in advising the hospital management on medical devices and software acquisition. The continuing expansion of these roles and responsibilities has put medical physicists on the forefront of embracing emerging technologies, making the profession one of the most technical and versatile in healthcare settings. Currently, as our field grows in importance, we medical physicists seek to continue to engage in significant ways to for increased contributions and roles in human health. This commentary/opinion urges medical physicists to prepare for their expanding roles in the field of AI and its implementation and oversight in clinical practice. Medical physicists must embrace ""Real AI"" to help integrate AI into healthcare practices. Conceptually we advocate for a strategy that involves Real AI through advocacy, broadening, and enhancing coordination/communication (an ABC strategy). In our current and future work medical physicists will use AI to automate routine tasks, allowing medical physicists to focus on more complex tasks. Furthermore, Medical Physics will use AI to enhance efficiency, safety, diagnostic and therapeutic applications, and for personalized medicine. However, as we have done in the past with other complex concepts (such as radiation), medical physicists need to be prepared for the potential risks and ethical dilemmas associated with AI, such as bias and lack of transparency. It will be important that Medical Physicists prepare for the rapidly changing AI landscape, and continue learning, gain hands-on experience, and collaborate with other AI experts in the healthcare environment. This paper aligns with the already approved guidance document developed by the AAPM in conjunction with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)3 that discusses how medical physicists can ensure the effective implementation and management of AI systems. It is crucial for the Clinical Quality Management Program (CQMP) personnel to receive regular training and updates on relevant guidelines and legislation. Clear communication channels should be established with IT experts, vendors, and other stakeholders for smooth coordination.4 Comprehensive documentation should be developed to ensure compliance with contractual obligations and guidelines. The clinical team should be involved in acceptance testing and discussions, depending on the clinical purpose of the AI system.4 Protocols for data collection and curation should be established, along with the development of standardized validation datasets for performance evaluation.4 A system for monitoring updates to AI systems and models should be implemented, with the CQMP leading new acceptance/commissioning rounds for any updates. Lastly, mechanisms for continuous evaluation and improvement of the CQMP processes should be established, which could involve regular audits, feedback mechanisms from end-users, and incorporating lessons learned from previous rounds.4 Nowadays, major healthcare systems in the US consider their data as immensely valuable assets that require rigorous protection to ensure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance, as well as intellectual property considerations. It can be very difficult for researchers to share clinical data with vendors for development purposes without a significant return being specified to the institution, such as joint intellectual property or substantial grant funding. Instead, these healthcare systems encourage their researchers to commercialize their findings independently, allowing the institution to retain full rights to intellectual property. That said, the realization of federated learning would be a significant advancement. To achieve this, a powerful pre-trained model that would be adaptable to operation on different scales and in various clinical scenarios is necessary. It is plausible that local adaptation may not require substantial computing power or AI expertise. This concept is particularly intriguing and could be beneficial to smaller centers and clinics in underserved areas. However, the primary challenge is the cost. As we become more reliant on AI systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google Gemini, we often overlook the fact that these conveniences come with a hefty price tag, costing billions of dollars to develop and maintain.5 As medical physicists we and other healthcare professionals can anticipate that AI will significantly transform healthcare, improving efficiency, accuracy, and the level of detail that can be extracted from imaging, and methods of therapy. These technological advancements are expected to bring immense value to the field, offering a new horizon in diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. Yet, we also must recognize that it also introduces potential significant risks and ethical dilemmas. One of the primary concerns is the possibility of bias in AI, which can stem from the training data, the algorithms, or their application, leading to potentially detrimental effects on patient care. As medical physicists, we should acknowledge that the complexity and lack of transparency in AI decision-making processes present obstacles in terms of accountability and rectifying errors and requires greater oversight and responsibility. The integration of AI also has great capacity in redefining the role of medical physicists, impacting education and employment within the field. Addressing these issues necessitates the creation of ethical standards for AI in healthcare, emphasizing transparency, responsibility, and equity, with contributions from diverse stakeholders, including patients, medical professionals, and ethicists.6 Such measures are crucial to ensure the responsible utilization of AI in healthcare, and ultimately serve the best interests of patients and society. We anticipate that continued guidance from our professional societies will be helpful as our collective communities develop methods and approaches that help us learn, adopt, and employ AI responsibly. Advocacy: increase educational initiative, public awareness, and recommending processes at all levels of the clinical workforce, as well as patient engagement. Broadening Perspectives: encourage Interdisciplinary Collaborations that allow medical physicists to work with professionals from other disciplines such as computer science, data science, and biomedical engineering, to gain insights into different perspectives on AI applications in healthcare. This enables medical physicists to provide continuing education and connect the community with research opportunities. Improving Coordination and Communication through creating team collaboration: enhance communication with healthcare professionals, administrators, and patients by clearly defining and articulating the role of medical physicists in AI applications. Promote the sharing of knowledge, as exemplified by creating data repositories through contributions, to further creating the foundation of our understanding and application of AI in the field. We consider the concept of Real AI in our context to be aimed at providing and/or qualifying a ready AI product that has undergone a rigorous QA process, that is free of false additives and biases, with data carefully curated to represent the demographics and be attuned to the needs of the clinic, sourced with proper ingredients, and abiding by laws and regulations that can ensure the product serves the common health needs of patients and benefits the public's interest. What AI 'is' and what it 'is not' is a complex topic that warrants further exploration and understanding, but one vital for comprehension of what utility AI can fulfill in the clinical process, what its advantages and limitations are, and how it can be curated to perform in the clinical scenarios relevant to a particular radiology/radiation oncology practice. Multiple data-analysis algorithms have been created over the course of years, and not all of them qualify as AI.7 What distinction(s) lie in what constitutes AI? One possible interpretation is that AI is a system that can adapt to new data, or a system that generates insights driven by data. AI systems are designed to ""learn"" and adapt to new data and be stable over the course of introducing data perturbations or employ model adaptation mechanisms. AI systems can adjust the underlying data-processing mechanisms based on the input they receive, which allows them to improve their performance and make more accurate predictions or decisions over time. This is often achieved through techniques such as machine learning, where algorithms are trained on a dataset and then used to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programed to perform the task.8 Understanding how such datasets are selected, what data needs to be fed into AI model to achieve desired results, and how to prevent common pitfalls and ethical conundrums associated with the use of AI models requires additional training that might yet be lacking in the traditional training of the radiology/radiation oncology adjacent specialists. The scope of involvement of each member of the team when it comes to AI integration into the clinic continues to be determined as the field rapidly evolves. When it comes to the role of medical physicists in conjunction with AI, an open discussion of the exact responsibilities is still ongoing, and feedback is encouraged from all the members of the community. So, what can medical physicists do? They can use AI to enhance quality improvement and safety by analyzing medical data to identify trends, patterns, and outliers.9 This can lead to the identification of areas for improvement or potential safety hazards and help them enter the realm of Responsible AI. AI can also improve diagnostic and therapeutic techniques by enhancing the quality of medical imaging and automating image interpretation.10 Furthermore, AI can help in integrating diagnostics, personalized medicine, and theragnostics by analyzing large datasets to tailor treatment plans to individual patients.11 This can lead to more effective and personalized care. AI can also automate routine tasks in medical physics, such as treatment planning and QA processes, leading to increased efficiency.12 Lastly, AI techniques like machine learning and deep learning can be leveraged for research and development to analyze complex datasets, discover patterns, and develop innovative techniques for disease detection, treatment, and monitoring.13 Whether it involves developing AI-driven solutions like automated segmentation, dose calculations, addressing intricate problems in the clinic, or potentially even contributing to open-source AI initiatives, such activities will empower medical physicists to enhance their skills and make tangible contributions to the advancement of healthcare. Embracing AI not only fosters a sense of accomplishment but also opens doors to the world of `automation' and scaling that will pervade all technologies of the future. The AHAIBC committee is at the center of bringing the medical physicist forward by developing curriculum concepts, bootcamps, and engendering engagement for our society. Integration of AI into the realm of medical physics education is critical, especially considering the potential significance of incorrect AI usage or misapplication. The physicist is responsible for installing and commissioning the AI software, ensuring the modeling is not biased, performing continuing QA on the hospital data and processes, and establishing efficient resource management. Embracing education in AI offers new benefits for medical physicists as it is already revolutionizing various industries and professional practices and we need to be equally prepared. One way to engage and prepare healthcare professionals for the upcoming AI wave is to start with the roots of quality safety and assurance. To do this, we should enable a comprehensive QA program that encompasses all clinical operations related to medical fields including radiology, nuclear medicine, and radiation oncology. Ensuring the safe operation of hardware, software, clinical operation processes and machinery is of utmost importance and one of the most crucial responsibilities of a medical physicist. A Real AI approach can be highly beneficial in achieving the goal of safe clinical implementation. Understanding the potential and limitations of AI serves as a cornerstone for fostering engagement not only within our profession but with other healthcare providers. Continuous learning and participation in hands-on experience are essential components for navigating the complexities of AI applications within healthcare. Collaboration, networking, and exploring AI's purpose and impact are equally vital in this journey. Additionally, some physicists may choose personal projects, embracing challenges in small groups, and actively contributing to AI-focused teams to amplify the motivation and expertise of our field. Insights through personal and collaborative opportunities ultimately provide for and encourage professional growth and innovation within our medical physics field. Some medical physicists may be able to attend specialty meetings and conferences dedicated to AI which further enriches their knowledge base and provides them avenues for fruitful collaboration. There are successful educational programs such as the Radiological Society of North America Artificial Intelligence (RSNA AI)-certificate program.14 Interdisciplinary cooperation and inter-institutional collaboration for AI experts is of paramount importance for integrating AI into medical physicists' practice on a larger scale, and mechanisms enabling this collaboration should be provided to the community. In summary, the authors believe that being prepared for and embracing the changes that AI is already bringing at the current time will benefit our community, healthcare, patient care, and society at large immediately and for the future. We are at a critical juncture, which can be considered a fourth industrial revolution, where AI and automation are applied more broadly. Medical physicists have a pivotal role to play in this revolution. We need to position ourselves at the forefront of 'Real AI' and lead the charge in this exciting new era. It is time for action, and we can take the first steps with potentially just a few ABCs. All authors contributed their efforts in writing and editing this call for action.

W3043610461,Connecting With Patients: The Rapid Rise of Voice Right Now,"Up until 5 years ago, I was a developer. I never thought that computers should be hard. When I was here previously, I discussed some of the things people can do with voice-enabled technology and how health care might be influenced [1Isbitski D. Fishman E.K. Horton K.M. Rowe S.P. Learning to talk again in a voice-first world.J Am Coll Radiol. 2019; 16: 1123-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. Even in the short time since then, interval advances have led to even more widespread adoption of voice-enabled devices and technologies, including Amazon Alexa and Echo, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, Apple Siri, and others. What is happening, far beyond anything that happened with the telephone or the Internet, is that voice is becoming routine throughout the day. No other technology has become such a part of routine. Technology has often been divisive, but now voice technology can help bring us together. Some of these technologies can be incorporated across multiple devices. Access to a computer is no longer necessary to have tremendous knowledge and ability through use of voice. Anyone who can speak a sentence can interact with voice-enabled devices. The artificial intelligence algorithms in such devices have traditionally broken down sentences into units the algorithms can understand, in order to subsequently provide appropriate responses. If we take an example, the sentence ""Alexa, ask for my heart rate from Healthkeeper"" includes a wake word (""Alexa""), a launch word (""ask""), an utterance (""my heart rate""), and an invocation name (""Healthkeeper""). Now, the algorithms work from much more conversational sentences, such as ""How did my heart rate do yesterday?"" From those increasingly conversational sentence structures, a user can access a tremendous fund of knowledge. Users specify actions and provide seed data, and developers work with an application programming interface to create responses and simulated dialogue; the resultant models lead to the development of a recurrent neural network that can be deployed in the voice-enabled device. From there, the device undergoes self-learning, and user interactions give feedback on live data, thereby constantly improving the neural network. One of the emerging abilities of voice-enabled devices is anticipating latent goals. If you say, ""I want a night out,"" the device can figure out that you will need transportation, food, and a movie and then assist you in arranging all of those. Furthermore, the ability of devices to visually recognize objects is improving, such that you can hold something up to the device and ask it to identify the object. This could profoundly help the visually impaired. Also, users are increasingly being put in charge of the neural network ""black box"" by being empowered to ask, ""Why did you do that?"" or ""What did you hear?"" The complexity of conversations with voice-enabled devices continues to increase from single-turn instructions leading to simple goals, through multiturn conversations leading to complex goals, to multisession reasoning leading to ambiguous goals (Fig. 1). Even medical devices can be enabled, and the ultimate goal is to make voice technology as available to everyone as possible. Hundreds of thousands of developers work with these devices to build skills that allow the devices to be able to talk about certain topics. Among the common topics for skills are health and lifestyle. Additionally, users are no longer restricted to just one possible voice from these devices; for example, those devices can learn to synthesize your voice. Imagine a patient's being able to access a device and hear your voice even when you are unable to be there. Voice can also be used in devices to help patients with medication routines, and they can be safety net devices for the elderly who live alone. With the limitations of senior health care shown so clearly by the nursing home coronavirus tragedy, the future will surely involve more people living in their homes rather than in large facilities. These changes can be supported by technology such as voice. Particularly during the coronavirus pandemic, there are many opportunities for us to use voice to improve our response to the public health crisis. For example, you can ask voice-enabled devices what you should do if you think you have coronavirus, how to make a face mask, to give you tips for cleaning, or to call a coronavirus helpline. You can train such devices to give you curated good news. Voice-enabled devices often have key information in many different languages. When working from home, people can teach their voice-enabled devices about topics, discuss those topics with the devices, and then publish and share the new skills the devices have now acquired. Reminders about when to take medications and when to go to a doctor's appointment are easily incorporated. Beyond providing information about the pandemic, voice-enabled devices can help us place video calls and connect with friends and relatives we are not able to see in person right now. There are voice platforms that allow kids to access kid-friendly things, giving their parents and caretakers potential breaks. Providing a voice, and connecting us with others, can help combat the profound feelings of loneliness that many have felt during this crisis. There is an increasing variety with which people are asking their devices about things, indicating that there are more people using voice-enabled technologies and that they are doing so more frequently and for longer periods of time. With the ongoing fear of the pandemic, and the conflicting data regarding possible spread from surfaces, being able to have voice commands decrease risk and provides the ability to bypass common danger points from elevator buttons to door knobs to credit card processing machines. Outside of the individual, the increasing presence of voice-enabled devices affects the data-gathering and research approaches to this pandemic as well as to future public health crises. These devices can facilitate the sharing and gathering of information, provide near instantaneous updated information, and facilitate the pooling of data for use by public health experts and artificial intelligence algorithms. The combination of rapidly advancing voice-enabled technology and the social changes we have seen because of the coronavirus have driven the adoption of voice as a potential transformative way that patients can obtain information and communicate with their health care providers. Because of the changes that have already occurred, we can expect that we will never go back entirely to how things were and that voice will be an increasingly important influence on health care. The focus on artificial intelligence in radiology has been on the use of algorithms to enhance image interpretation and uncover imaging biomarkers. However, artificial intelligence will have profound impacts across radiology practices, and the rise of voice-enabled devices indicates that. We can expect that patient preparation, explanations of studies, and the consenting process will be well handled by voice-enabled devices with artificial intelligence algorithms. Radiology, and medicine more broadly, needs to find creative ways to apply voice to existing and emerging technologies and work flows. For example, wearable technologies such as voice-enabled glasses could allow a physician to record important aspects of a patient history or physical for later review. The same technology could be used to provide guided tours and to keep patients and visitors from getting lost in the hospital. Successful practices that emerge from the coronavirus pandemic in strong positions will find ways to leverage artificial intelligence, and voice-enabled technologies can play a large role in that. Our day-to-day work in our offices will also change. Voice-enabled technologies can finally help us to realize the ""paperless"" office. Our phone calls, dictations, and communications with colleagues can all be done in a contactless way using voice.

W4401097446,Promoting Language Justice for Children With Medical Complexity and Their Families: An Urgent Call to Action,"People who use languages other than English (defined as those whose primary language identity is something other than English)1 comprise nearly 9% of the US population.2 Sixty percent of children who are first- or second-generation immigrants (1 or more parents born outside of the United States) have at least 1 caregiver who use languages other than English.3 These caregivers and their children experience health and health care disparities, including worse health care access, lower health care quality, and higher experiences of adverse medical outcomes.4,5 To address these disparities, health care systems must implement a language justice approach,6 whereby the responsibility of provision of linguistically affirming services is shouldered by health care systems rather than patients, and where language services are seamlessly interwoven into all parts of a patients' health care experience.In this edition of Hospital Pediatrics, Luercio et al take a step to further elucidate how best to implement language justice in health care settings by conducting interviews around inpatient hospital communication challenges and opportunities with Spanish-speaking parents of children with medical complexity (CMC) and hospital staff members.7 Trust emerged as a cross-cutting facilitator to optimal communication. Trust in the medical system is critical and deeply interwoven with improved health care access, quality, and health outcomes.5,8 However, mistrust of health care is often well justified because of historical and current day harm perpetrated against marginalized communities, including families who use languages other than English. Trustworthiness, or actions taken by health care clinicians and systems to show they are deserving of trust, is an important paradigm shift9,10 and aligned with a language justice approach.Luercio et al noted how participants shared that caregivers would ask for interpreters if not provided. To foster trustworthiness, health care systems should implement strengths-based and affirming strategies to identify patients who use languages other than English and provide them with linguistically affirming services. Universally screening all families on registration with a question such as ""What language would you like for your care today? We have free and confidential interpreter services available"" will ensure that families do not need to advocate for language services and that they will receive services seamlessly throughout their health care experience. Individuals within a family may have different language identities (ie, the child, caregivers); therefore, in pediatric settings, it is critical to ask and document each caregivers' (and for children and adolescents, the patient's) language identity.11Use of certified, professional interpreters is required in health care settings under Title VI of the Civil Right Act, Executive Order 13166, and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. However, similar to other studies, Luercio et al uncovered the use of ""workarounds"" when language services are unavailable or underused, including ad hoc interpreters, families being asked to use English, or use of nonverbal cues. Ad hoc interpreter use (eg, bilingual staff, use of family members) is associated with suboptimal communication,12 which can be particularly dangerous for CMC who have lower reported health-related quality of life,13 independent of language. It may also be traumatizing for the family member who interprets (eg, interpreting for a sibling's care) or for the person themself (eg, a survivor of partner violence having their abusive partner interpret). Past studies have also demonstrated how clinicians may use their language skills, even if they are not fluent,14 or may attempt to speak in English with a person who uses languages other than English. Language is complex; although some caregivers may be able to use English in some contexts, it may not be the primary language identity they wish to use when they are in a health care setting or at their most vulnerable. Systems-level solutions are needed to ensure provision of linguistically affirming services, such as universal training for all staff, interpreters being part of mock codes (as it may be harder to remember to use linguistically affirming services during emergencies), review of all clinical protocols and policies to ensure inclusion of provisions around language justice, and integration of language documentation in the electronic medical record.Another systems-level opportunity is hiring and training a culturally diverse and multilingual workforce. Although Luercio et al found that interpreters were highly acceptable, families also desired linguistically concordant staff. Physician–patient language concordance is associated with increased patient satisfaction, patient–physician trust, and medication adherence.15,16 Although ethnoracial concordance is important, language concordance among non-Hispanic White health care workers can still be impactful. The call for workforce diversity is not new and takes time, resources, and long-term investment to recruit, retain, and promote culturally and linguistically diverse staff. High school and university pipeline programs for individuals from racial and ethnic populations underrepresented in medicine, as well as bilingual individuals can foster support and mentoring for those interested in the health care field. Health care training should more broadly offer language courses and assessments to support interest in multilingual learning among medical students, physicians, nurses, medical assistants, and social workers (eg, Clínica Hispana de Cuidados de Salud-CHiCoS program).17Language is integrally intertwined with culture, as shown in this study where participants highlighted their experiences with cultural stereotyping, leading authors to urge cultural humility when serving immigrant, refugee, and families speaking languages other than English. Cultural humility shifts away from considering culture in a superficial or stereotypical way, and instead recommends active listening, power sharing, and continuously understanding how a family's lived experience may impact their health-related decision making.18 Cultural humility also prioritizes the strength and beauty of culture and language, rather than viewing these concepts from a deficits-based lens and highlights the heterogeneity of lived experiences rather than seeing cultural groups as a monolith. In addition to culture, health care systems must consider the intersecting impacts of structural oppressions on families who use languages other than English. Upward of 4 million US children have at least 1 parent without documentation, who may be fearful to apply for public benefits such as supplemental nutrition, Women, Infants, and Children program, subsidized housing, and social security disability insurance for their CMC.19 These intersecting vulnerabilities may create compounding challenges for families in accessing health care and achieving optimal health underscoring the urgent need for health care systems to create healing-centered spaces that address structural violence.Luercio et al also highlighted the important opportunities and challenges offered by technology to provide linguistically affirming services. Health care has experienced rapid innovation in the past decade, catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the advent of telemedicine and the increased use of the patient portal for medical communication. These innovations, although helpful for some, may be widening health care disparities. For example, studies have shown that caregivers who use languages other than English are less likely to access telehealth services compared with caregivers who use English.20 Written communication is now a common way for patients to interact with the health care system, through patient messages, review of notes or patient instructions, and visit reminders. There is currently inconsistent translation of patient-facing written materials and limited options for clinicians to translate patient instructions in real time.21 Providing equitable access to telemedicine services and written health care materials may be even more critical for families with CMC, who need to attend health care visits more frequently and may have more complicated discharge instructions. One consideration mentioned in the article is use of artificial intelligence (eg, Google Translate) to serve as a real-time translator. A 2023 review of machine learning tools for health outreach and communication with communities who use languages other than English showed that more than half presented mixed or inclusive results regarding accuracy and readiness of machine learning for the dissemination of public health information.22 An article from 2021 examining accuracy of Google Translate in translating medication directions and counseling found varying accuracy among Arabic, simplified Chinese, and Spanish translations, with 29% of the inaccuracies considered highly clinically significant or potentially life threatening.23 Although current evidence does not support use of artificial intelligence to augment translation services in health care settings, further work in collaboration with artificial intelligence experts is needed to determine how to develop systems that can promote language justice while also ensuring thriving and longevity for the translator workforce.A critical aspect and innovation of this work is ""centering on the margins"" or amplifying the voices of families who use languages other than English in policy, practice, and research.24 Past studies have shown that participants who use languages other than English are often excluded from pediatric health research25 and pediatric clinical trials.26 Research representation is a powerful tool to amplify the voices of communities through science, disrupt health disparities, and foster trustworthiness of health care. Research must also align with a language justice approach, ensuring optimal spoken, written, and signed communication with participants in all phases of the research process, including reporting participants' primary language in publications.6,27 Research with participants must particularly consider equitable inclusion of families with intersecting vulnerabilities (such as caregivers of CMC) and must be conducted in partnership with families and culturally affirming community based organizations.Language justice in health care and research is an essential step toward disrupting health disparities and promoting equity for communities who use languages other than English. Pediatric health care systems have an urgent responsibility to implement evidenced-based, equity-centered practices and policies that foster trustworthiness, provide linguistically affirming services, leverage health care innovations, and promote a thriving workforce of bilingual and bicultural clinicians, interpreters, and translators. Language justice, as a critical aspect of health equity and justice, cannot be an afterthought and must be intentionally incorporated into health care and research to radically change the health care experience for families and promote lifelong thriving for CMC.",2024-07-29,2024,Maya I.

W3116118545,Reflections on Diversity and Inclusion,"Déjà vu is the feeling that one has lived through the present situation before… As we reflect on the past, present, and future, it feels like we have seen this before. Despite significant career and professional growth as an underrepresented academic surgeon, I am actually quite amazed to find myself in this place at this time in these circumstances. I feel proud and fortunate to be one of the very few, if not the first, African American leaders of any Department at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. But I am not sure that is the most remarkable thing at all. I am sure that my journey is very similar to others – the life of people of color in America in the postJim Crow Era from the 1950s to now – a combination of hard work, resilience, good fortune, and perseverance in the face of structural racism, discrimination, and explicit and implicit bias. What may have changed, is the realization that the lived experiences of being Black in America are now a point of consternation and concern for those who live in the world of White majority privilege, thanks to social media and irrefutable evidence in the real world of violations of human rights directed against those who are most vulnerable based upon race, gender, socioeconomic status, and color. The intention of this reflection is to not only identify the obvious societal failures throughout the country, but to also point out that we, as accountable academic leaders, have an extraordinary challenge and unprecedented opportunity to change the part of this world where we have the greatest impact and influence: the world of academic medicine. I am impressed by a concept and want to share the idea of “inclusive excellence” championed by organizations like the Association of American Medical Colleges and the NIH. “inclusive excellence” is defined as the recognition that an academic community or institution's success is dependent on how well it values, engages, promotes, and includes the rich diversity of students, staff, faculty, administration, and alumni constituents. In this model, diversity is a key component of a comprehensive strategy for achieving institutional excellence – it embraces the academic excellence of all learners and faculty, but inclusion must be part of the effort to be more diverse. Active, intentional, strategic, thoughtful, and ongoing engagement help us have a better understanding of the experiences of the people around us, a better understanding of the complex environment in our school, our city, and our country. This is an essential component of our effort if we want to be successful in making this a better place.1“Carve a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of disappointment.” - Dr Martin Luther King, Jr.2 Our lived experiences often tell a story. My mother and father met in Nashville in the 1950s when my father graduated from Meharry Medical School, one of a few places where a person of color could get medical training in the 1950s. After graduation, they married and moved to Camp Pendleton, where my dad served in the United States Navy as a physician attached to the Marines. I was born in San Diego in 1958 and a few years later, my family moved to Charleston, South Carolina to start one of the few general medicine practices in my father's hometown. Life was good – until someone ran a stop sign and killed my father in a car accident – he had no life insurance (because he was going to live forever) and my mom was widowed with three young boys, ages 5, 3, and 1 years old. A devastating loss, for sure. We moved to upstate New York to live with my grandparents and extended family network, who helped raise 3 hell-raising boys. Throughout my childhood, we experienced a nurturing environment where discipline, academic excellence, and service to the community above self were taught and expected. In 1965, my grandfather, fresh on the heels of a promotion as legal counsel and the regional director of the New York State Commission for Human Rights, contracted to buy a house in an all-White neighborhood, only to have that house burn to the ground in what police termed as “suspicious circumstances.” He was quoted as saying in the local news that, “They better get another fire lit – there's something else involved now, something personal, but we’re used to that.”3 Our family later relocated to another home a few blocks away and lived in a desegregated neighborhood for many years until my grandparents’ death. Violence against people of color is not a recent phenomenon. During the past 30 years, there have been many other examples of racially motivated discrimination during my training as a cardiothoracic and transplant surgeon – random traffic stops in my neighborhood as a Black man driving a nice car; patients asking if I am the orderly or environmental services worker in the hospital; senior majority faculty questioning my opinions and or judgment in the clinical setting… So what lessons do we learn from these experiences? Many would be disillusioned, angry, and despondent, yet my brothers and I were taught to be strong and resilient, coached to keep our goals in sight and to work hard to have a positive influence in the world. We were taught that, at some point, we would impact change in thought by our deeds and actions. Although these are lessons many people of color learn in their lifetime, in the current context, it is a part of the reality of being Black in our country. It will be difficult to move forward if we do not acknowledge how things have been in the past, as well as the current state of affairs for people of color in this country. How should we respond when the death of George Floyd and so many other people of color send a seismic shockwave through the academic landscape, and create a geopolitical firestorm across our country and the world? Although I cannot speak for everyone, my informal– and now more formal voice (in my recently appointed role as Senior Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion at Hopkins) –is positioned to join the chorus of those who want to have an impact in places like Johns Hopkins. As we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the pioneering efforts of Alfred Blalock, Helen Tausig, and Vivien Thomas, who innovated the famous surgical treatment of the Blue Baby Syndrome in the 1940s, we are reminded of the miraculous circumstances under which these things occurred. In a place where structural racism and discrimination were evident and obvious, Vivien Thomas was prevented from having full rights as a surgeon or scientist, which created barriers to full acceptance and collaboration between Black and White. Yet, despite these barriers, commitment to the well-being of these children helped to create the dawn of a new era in cardiac surgery.“Excellence of performance will transcend artificial barriers created by man.” - Charles Drew, M.D.4 Many of our predecessors and mentors, like Levi Watkins (the first African American cardiac resident at Johns Hopkins and the first to implant the automatic cardiac defibrillator in a patient), shook the foundation of the academic world. They demanded that academic medicine create a place at the table for people of color and those who were underrepresented in medicine. Many now call for partnership between majority and minority concerns to influence academic processes like promotion, recruitment, and retention in medical admissions and research training. Although I believe that many of these efforts are well-intentioned, they only scratch the surface of equality, diversity, and equity – most academic environments at majority institutions struggle to create real change in these areas.“Privilege is invisible to those who have it – for those who have privilege, equality feels like discrimination.” - Professor Michael Kimmel5 A lack of clear understanding of these concepts may be why we struggle to accomplish substantive improvements and goals. Diversity focuses on representation, any collective mixture characterized by differences including, but not limited to, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, language, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, and ability status. Inclusion focuses on involvement – the practice of encouraging and belonging, participation, and celebration of differences. Equity and equality are 2 strategies that are used in an effort to produce fairness. Equity is giving everyone what they need to be successful. Equality is treating everyone the same – it aims to promote fairness, but it can only work if everyone starts from the same place and needs the same help. These concepts resonate now more than ever. There has been a proliferation of articles, analyses, training opportunities, and organizational reflections about diversity, equity, and inclusion during the past several years. In 2015, my family and I arrived in Baltimore to search for a new home during the time of the disturbance and riots after the death of Freddie Gray. My kids thought it was wild to have armed National Guard troops and armored vehicles on street corners in downtown Baltimore. The outpouring of concern and activity by the Johns Hopkins Medicine leadership and academic community to stand up and be counted against police brutality, structural racism, and explicit bias in Baltimore struck me in a profound and positive way then. Five years later, we should ask ourselves: Has anything changed? I do believe that there is a general acknowledgment by people of all races that we have a better understanding of the obstacles people of color face. There is greater awareness of the problem of race and equity issues thanks to social media, but there has been little recent change in actual conditions – it may even be worse! Organizations have invested extensively in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives – bias training as the most frequent activity – but there are fewer shifts toward equity in the academic workplace. Perhaps we have seen some improvements in career support. You can be the judge if you think it is better overall. The current macro and micro-aggressions people of color face every day in academic medicine are evidence that we still have work to do.“Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are affected.” - Unknown Johns Hopkins has a storied history of extraordinary patient care, education, innovation, and groundbreaking research for over 130 years. In my opinion, one of the greatest challenges for Hopkins and other academic institutions in the modern era is to extend its impact in the identification, training, and professional development of healthcare professionals from underrepresented groups in medicine, including ethnic minorities, women, and those from diverse religions, national origins, lower socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation. Critical to this effort must be the development of an environment that fosters acceptance and professionalism where those who are underrepresented in medicine are not only admitted, but welcomed to these institutions as an academic home. As we move forward in the current world, we are likely to learn many more lessons. But how much more do we need to understand? In addition to the need to provide better health care coverage to the underserved and minority populations and developing a more effective public health response to a potential crisis like the COVID pandemic, the recruitment, training, and deployment of a diverse healthcare workforce has never been more important. Calls to action in those areas hardest hit by this crisis not only emphasize the shortage of physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and allied health professionals, but it underscores the need for a more diverse healthcare workforce dedicated to serving those in need. In addition to acknowledging our shortfalls, what actions can we take to create a more diverse and inclusive academic environment here and in medicine in general? Sincere, earnest listening and reflection to understand the Underrepresented in Medicine (URM) perspective and challenges– followed by thoughtful and intentional action to address these issues to bring about a more equitable and sustainable future. From my perspective, there are areas to focus on as a starting point, which include improvements in process, promotion, and programming: Process – Recruitment: For example, provide scholarships for URM subinternships, premed/medical student research opportunities in Science, technology, engineering, mathmatics and manufactoring, organize second-look recruitment activities for admitted medical students, increase URM faculty identification and recruitment when hiring new fellows/PhDs/faculty. Promotion – Retention and Faculty Development: For example, meet with Department Directors and Chairs to assure and even mandate URM candidate inclusion in new faculty recruitment/retention, support portfolio preparation for academic promotion of URMs and women being considered for promotion to Associate/full Professor to ensure their success. Programs – Racial and Multicultural Competency and Inclusion: For example, introduce and require implicit/unconscious bias training for School of medicine students, faculty, and program leadership; leadership training for any and all who would benefit from learning how to “Navigate the Maze in Academic Medicine”; consider monitoring/incentivizing program and departmental leadership based upon their performance in addressing diversity initiatives. In my opinion, there is an additional dimension, which continues to undermine our current URM representation in academic medicine and in healthcare specialties like surgery. Our current medical culture is a relatively unsupportive environment for URM students and faculty.Speaking from my personal experience, it can be a very isolating experience in academic medicine as a person of color or URM. When there is a very small percentage of those who are from a similar cultural experience or racially sensitive backgrounds to share academic experiences, it is very difficult. Creating a racial and multicultural environment that is inclusive and supportive with a network of supportive faculty and staff – a critical mass of URM professionals – would have a huge impact and lead to the successful recruitment and retention of more URM students, staff, and faculty.Our goal for every faculty member, particularly those underrepresented in medicine, is to avoid the past and create a future where we can be “seen, heard and valued.” A. Haggins, MD.6 In the final analysis, this is the call to action in our time –to positively affect change in healthcare across the country and to create a better future.

W4304762392,Diagnostic Performance of Deep Learning in Infectious Keratitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol,"ABSTRACT Introduction Infectious keratitis (IK) represents the 5 th leading cause of blindness worldwide. A delay in diagnosis is often a major factor in progression to irreversible visual impairment and/or blindness from IK. The diagnostic challenge is further compounded by low microbiological culture yield, long turnaround time, poorly differentiated clinical features, and polymicrobial infections. In recent years, deep learning (DL), a subfield of artificial intelligence, has rapidly emerged as a promising tool in assisting automated medical diagnosis, clinical triage and decision making, and improving workflow efficiency in healthcare services. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of using DL in assisting the diagnosis of IK, though the accuracy remains to be elucidated. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to critically examine and compare the performance of various DL models with clinical experts and/or microbiological results (the current “gold standard”) in diagnosing IK, with an aim to inform practice on the clinical applicability and deployment of DL-assisted diagnostic models. Methods and analysis This review will consider studies that included application of any DL models to diagnose patients with suspected IK, encompassing bacterial, fungal, protozoal and/or viral origins. We will search various electronic databases, including EMBASE and MEDLINE. There will be no restriction to the language and publication date. Two independent reviewers will assess the titles, abstracts and full-text articles. Extracted data will include details of each primary studies, including title, year of publication, authors, types of DL models used, populations, sample size, decision threshold, and diagnostic performance. We will perform meta-analyses for the included primary studies when there are sufficient similarities in outcome reporting. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval is required for this systematic review. We plan to disseminate our findings via presentation/publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Protocol registration This systematic review protocol will be registered with the PROSPERO after peer review. STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY - This study will serve as the most up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis specifically evaluating the diagnostic performance of deep learning in infectious keratitis. - The quality of the study will depend on the quality of the available published literature related to this topic. - This study will help identify the gaps in the current clinical evidence, which may be related to study design, quality of the research methodologies, setting of reference standard, risk of bias, and outcome reporting.",2022-10-12,2022,Zun Zheng Ong; Youssef Sadek; Xiaoxuan Liu; Riaz Qureshı; Su‐Hsun Liu,Queen's Medical Centre,medRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory),0,https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.11.22280968,AI_Machine_Learning,MEDLINE; Workflow; Protocol (science); Triage; Systematic review,0.7
W3128156084,Design and Comparative Performance of a Robust Lung Auscultation System for Noisy Clinical Settings,"Chest auscultation is a widely used clinical tool for respiratory disease detection. The stethoscope has undergone a number of transformative enhancements since its invention, including the introduction of electronic systems in the last two decades. Nevertheless, stethoscopes remain riddled with a number of issues that limit their signal quality and diagnostic capability, rendering both traditional and electronic stethoscopes unusable in noisy or non-traditional environments (e.g., emergency rooms, rural clinics, ambulatory vehicles). This work outlines the design and validation of an advanced electronic stethoscope that dramatically reduces external noise contamination through hardware redesign and real-time, dynamic signal processing. The proposed system takes advantage of an acoustic sensor array, an external facing microphone, and on-board processing to perform adaptive noise suppression. The proposed system is objectively compared to six commercially-available acoustic and electronic devices in varying levels of simulated noisy clinical settings and quantified using two metrics that reflect perceptual audibility and statistical similarity, normalized covariance measure (NCM) and magnitude squared coherence (MSC). The analyses highlight the major limitations of current stethoscopes and the significant improvements the proposed system makes in challenging settings by minimizing both distortion of lung sounds and contamination by ambient noise.",2021-02-03,2021,Ian McLane; Dimitra Emmanouilidou; J.

W4307841611,The Virtual Inclusive Digital Health Intervention Design to Promote Health Equity (iDesign) Framework for Atrial Fibrillation: Co-design and Development Study,"Smartphone ownership and mobile app use are steadily increasing in individuals of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds living in the United States. Growing adoption of technology creates a perfect opportunity for digital health interventions to increase access to health care. To successfully implement digital health interventions and engage users, intervention development should be guided by user input, which is best achieved by the process of co-design. Digital health interventions co-designed with the active engagement of users have the potential to increase the uptake of guideline recommendations, which can reduce morbidity and mortality and advance health equity.We aimed to co-design a digital health intervention for patients with atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia, with patient, caregiver, and clinician feedback and to describe our approach to human-centered design for building digital health interventions.We conducted virtual meetings with patients with atrial fibrillation (n=8), their caregivers, and clinicians (n=8). We used the following 7 steps in our co-design process: step 1, a virtual meeting focused on defining challenges and empathizing with problems that are faced in daily life by individuals with atrial fibrillation and clinicians; step 2, a virtual meeting focused on ideation and brainstorming the top challenges identified during the first meeting; step 3, individualized onboarding of patients with an existing minimally viable version of the atrial fibrillation app; step 4, virtual prototyping of the top 3 ideas generated during ideation; step 5, further ranking by the study investigators and engineers of the ideas that were generated during ideation but were not chosen as top-3 solutions to be prototyped in step 4; step 6, ongoing engineering work to incorporate top-priority features in the app; and step 7, obtaining further feedback from patients and testing the atrial fibrillation digital health intervention in a pilot clinical study.The top challenges identified by patients and caregivers included addressing risk factor modification, medication adherence, and guidance during atrial fibrillation episodes. Challenges identified by clinicians were complementary and included patient education, addressing modifiable atrial fibrillation risk factors, and remote atrial fibrillation episode management. Patients brainstormed more than 30 ideas to address the top challenges, and the clinicians generated more than 20 ideas. Ranking of the ideas informed several novel or modified features aligned with the Theory of Health Behavior Change, features that were geared toward risk factor modification; patient education; rhythm, symptom, and trigger correlation for remote atrial fibrillation management; and social support.We co-designed an atrial fibrillation digital health intervention in partnership with patients, caregivers, and clinicians by virtually engaging in collaborative creation through the design process. We summarize our experience and describe a flexible approach to human-centered design for digital health intervention development that can guide innovative clinical investigators.",2022-10-31,2022,Nino Isakadze; Nancy Molello; Zane MacFarlane; Yumin Gao; Erin M.

W4307373585,"Responding to a call to action for health equity curriculum development in pediatric graduate medical education: Design, implementation and early results of Leaders in Health Equity (LHE)","Recent calls to action have urged graduate medical education leaders to develop health equity-focused curricula (HEFC) to redouble efforts to promote pediatric HE and address racism. Despite this call, examples of HEFC for pediatric residents are lacking. Such curricula could catalyze educational innovations to address training gaps.To describe the design, content, and delivery of ""Leaders in Health Equity (LHE),"" an innovative HEFC delivered to categorical pediatric residents using multi-modal, service-free retreats.This single institution, longitudinal curriculum study occurred between 2014 and 2020 and reports multi-level outcomes including: (1) impact on trainee's health equity related knowledge, skills and satisfaction, (2) residency impact and (3) institutional impact. Educational approaches used related to design, content and delivery are summarized and detailed.Trainees (n = 72) demonstrated significant improvements in pre-post knowledge and skills related to HE content. Residents also reported increased desire for advanced HE content over the course of the 6-year study period. Residency impact on operations and resources were sustainable with the opportunity for integration of LHE content in other curricular and training areas noted. Institutional impact included catalyzing organizational HE initiatives and observing an increase in resident-led quality improvement (QI) projects focused on LHE content.On-going adaptation and growth of LHE content to educate increasingly prepared pediatric trainees is a critical next step and a best practice for educators in this evolving field. Developing HEFC within pediatric training programs using a longitudinal, leadership-centered approach may be an effective educational strategy in addressing pediatric health disparities.",2022-10-25,2022,Raquel Hernandez; Darcy A.
