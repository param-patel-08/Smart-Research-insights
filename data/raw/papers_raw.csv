W3140854437,"Review of deep learning: concepts, CNN architectures, challenges, applications, future directions","In the last few years, the deep learning (DL) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning (ML) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL. The paper ends with the evolution matrix, benchmark datasets, and summary and conclusion.",2021-03-31,2021,Laith Alzubaidi; Jinglan Zhang; Amjad J. Humaidi; Ayad Q.

W4236357753,The ARRIVE guidelines 2.0: Updated guidelines for reporting animal research,"Reproducible science requires transparent reporting. The ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) were originally developed in 2010 to improve the reporting of animal research. They consist of a checklist of information to include in publications describing in vivo experiments to enable others to scrutinise the work adequately, evaluate its methodological rigour, and reproduce the methods and results. Despite considerable levels of endorsement by funders and journals over the years, adherence to the guidelines has been inconsistent, and the anticipated improvements in the quality of reporting in animal research publications have not been achieved. Here, we introduce ARRIVE 2.0. The guidelines have been updated and information reorganised to facilitate their use in practice. We used a Delphi exercise to prioritise and divide the items of the guidelines into 2 sets, the ""ARRIVE Essential 10,"" which constitutes the minimum requirement, and the ""Recommended Set,"" which describes the research context. This division facilitates improved reporting of animal research by supporting a stepwise approach to implementation. This helps journal editors and reviewers verify that the most important items are being reported in manuscripts. We have also developed the accompanying Explanation and Elaboration (E&E) document, which serves (1) to explain the rationale behind each item in the guidelines, (2) to clarify key concepts, and (3) to provide illustrative examples.

W3014641072,Deep High-Resolution Representation Learning for Visual Recognition,"High-resolution representations are essential for position-sensitive vision problems, such as human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Existing state-of-the-art frameworks first encode the input image as a low-resolution representation through a subnetwork that is formed by connecting high-to-low resolution convolutions <i>in series</i> (e.g., ResNet, VGGNet), and then recover the high-resolution representation from the encoded low-resolution representation. Instead, our proposed network, named as High-Resolution Network (HRNet), maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process. There are two key characteristics: (i) Connect the high-to-low resolution convolution streams <i>in parallel</i> and (ii) repeatedly exchange the information across resolutions. The benefit is that the resulting representation is semantically richer and spatially more precise. We show the superiority of the proposed HRNet in a wide range of applications, including human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection, suggesting that the HRNet is a stronger backbone for computer vision problems.

W4210257598,A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Neural Networks,"Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications, where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on the existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art GNNs into four categories, namely, recurrent GNNs, convolutional GNNs, graph autoencoders, and spatial-temporal GNNs. We further discuss the applications of GNNs across various domains and summarize the open-source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of GNNs. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.",2020-03-24,2020,Zonghan Wu; Shirui Pan; Fengwen Chen; Guodong Long; Chengqi Zhang,University of Technology Sydney,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,3416,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2020.2978386,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Graph; Artificial neural network; Artificial intelligence; Theoretical computer science,0.4
W3168997536,"A Survey of Convolutional Neural Networks: Analysis, Applications, and Prospects","A convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most significant networks in the deep learning field. Since CNN made impressive achievements in many areas, including but not limited to computer vision and natural language processing, it attracted much attention from both industry and academia in the past few years. The existing reviews mainly focus on CNN's applications in different scenarios without considering CNN from a general perspective, and some novel ideas proposed recently are not covered. In this review, we aim to provide some novel ideas and prospects in this fast-growing field. Besides, not only 2-D convolution but also 1-D and multidimensional ones are involved. First, this review introduces the history of CNN. Second, we provide an overview of various convolutions. Third, some classic and advanced CNN models are introduced; especially those key points making them reach state-of-the-art results. Fourth, through experimental analysis, we draw some conclusions and provide several rules of thumb for functions and hyperparameter selection. Fifth, the applications of 1-D, 2-D, and multidimensional convolution are covered.

W2998508940,Random Erasing Data Augmentation,"In this paper, we introduce Random Erasing, a new data augmentation method for training the convolutional neural network (CNN). In training, Random Erasing randomly selects a rectangle region in an image and erases its pixels with random values. In this process, training images with various levels of occlusion are generated, which reduces the risk of over-fitting and makes the model robust to occlusion. Random Erasing is parameter learning free, easy to implement, and can be integrated with most of the CNN-based recognition models. Albeit simple, Random Erasing is complementary to commonly used data augmentation techniques such as random cropping and flipping, and yields consistent improvement over strong baselines in image classification, object detection and person re-identification.

W3036063864,Purposive sampling: complex or simple? Research case examples,"Purposive sampling has a long developmental history and there are as many views that it is simple and straightforward as there are about its complexity. The reason for purposive sampling is the better matching of the sample to the aims and objectives of the research, thus improving the rigour of the study and trustworthiness of the data and results. Four aspects to this concept have previously been described: credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability.The aim of this paper is to outline the nature and intent of purposive sampling, presenting three different case studies as examples of its application in different contexts.Presenting individual case studies has highlighted how purposive sampling can be integrated into varying contexts dependent on study design. The sampling strategies clearly situate each study in terms of trustworthiness for data collection and analysis. The selected approach to purposive sampling used in each case aligns to the research methodology, aims and objectives, thus addressing each of the aspects of rigour.Making explicit the approach used for participant sampling provides improved methodological rigour as judged by the four aspects of trustworthiness.

W4206706211,Transformers in Vision: A Survey,"Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM). Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works.",2022-01-06,2022,Salman Khan; Muzammal Naseer; Munawar Hayat; Syed Waqas Zamir; Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Australian National University,ACM Computing Surveys,2245,https://doi.org/10.1145/3505244,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Transformer; Segmentation; Artificial intelligence; Image processing,0.625
W3093223973,Can I use TA? Should I use TA? Should I<i>not</i>use TA? Comparing reflexive thematic analysis and other pattern‐based qualitative analytic approaches,"Abstract Thematic analysis methods, including the reflexive approach we have developed, are widely used in counselling and psychotherapy research, as are other approaches that seek to develop ‘patterns’ (themes, categories) across cases. Without a thorough grounding in the conceptual foundations of a wide variety of across‐case analytic approaches, and qualitative research more broadly—something rarely offered in counselling training—it can be difficult to understand how these differ, where they overlap, and which might be appropriate for a particular research project. Our aim in this paper is to support researchers in counselling and psychotherapy to select an appropriate across‐case approach for their research, and to justify their choice, by discussing conceptual and procedural differences and similarities between reflexive thematic analysis (TA) and four other across‐case approaches. Three of these are also widely used in counselling and psychotherapy research—qualitative content analysis, interpretative phenomenological analysis and grounded theory. The fourth—discourse analysis—is less widely used but importantly exemplifies the critical qualitative research tradition. We contextualise our comparative approach by highlighting the diversity within TA. TA is best thought of as a spectrum of methods—from types that prioritise coding accuracy and reliability to reflexive approaches like ours that emphasise the inescapable subjectivity of data interpretation. Although reflexive TA provides the point of comparison for our discussion of other across‐case approaches, our aim is not to promote reflexive TA as ‘best’. Rather, we encourage the knowing selection and use of analytic methods and methodologies in counselling and psychotherapy research.",2020-10-18,2020,Virginia Braun; Victoria Clarke,University of Auckland,Counselling and Psychotherapy Research,2054,https://doi.org/10.1002/capr.12360,AI_Machine_Learning,Reflexivity; Thematic analysis; Qualitative research; Psychology; Variety (cybernetics),0.225
W4285585446,"Metaverse beyond the hype: Multidisciplinary perspectives on emerging challenges, opportunities, and agenda for research, practice and policy","The metaverse has the potential to extend the physical world using augmented and virtual reality technologies allowing users to seamlessly interact within real and simulated environments using avatars and holograms. Virtual environments and immersive games (such as, Second Life, Fortnite, Roblox and VRChat) have been described as antecedents of the metaverse and offer some insight to the potential socio-economic impact of a fully functional persistent cross platform metaverse. Separating the hype and ""meta…"" rebranding from current reality is difficult, as ""big tech"" paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people. This study examines these topics in detail by combining the informed narrative and multi-perspective approach from experts with varied disciplinary backgrounds on many aspects of the metaverse and its transformational impact.

W4294106961,Advances and Open Problems in Federated Learning,"The term Federated Learning was coined as recently as 2016 to describe a machine learning setting where multiple entities collaborate in solving a machine learning problem, under the coordination of a central server or service provider. Each client’s raw data is stored locally and not exchanged or transferred; instead, focused updates intended for immediate aggregation are used to achieve the learning objective. Since then, the topic has gathered much interest across many different disciplines and the realization that solving many of these interdisciplinary problems likely requires not just machine learning but techniques from distributed optimization, cryptography, security, differential privacy, fairness, compressed sensing, systems, information theory, statistics, and more. This monograph has contributions from leading experts across the disciplines, who describe the latest state-of-the art from their perspective. These contributions have been carefully curated into a comprehensive treatment that enables the reader to understand the work that has been done and get pointers to where effort is required to solve many of the problems before Federated Learning can become a reality in practical systems. Researchers working in the area of distributed systems will find this monograph an enlightening read that may inspire them to work on the many challenging issues that are outlined.

W3093231216,Achieving Effective Remote Working During the COVID‐19 Pandemic: A Work Design Perspective,"Existing knowledge on remote working can be questioned in an extraordinary pandemic context. We conducted a mixed‐methods investigation to explore the challenges experienced by remote workers at this time, as well as what virtual work characteristics and individual differences affect these challenges. In Study 1, from semi‐structured interviews with Chinese employees working from home in the early days of the pandemic, we identified four key remote work challenges (work‐home interference, ineffective communication, procrastination, and loneliness), as well as four virtual work characteristics that affected the experience of these challenges (social support, job autonomy, monitoring, and workload) and one key individual difference factor (workers’ self‐discipline). In Study 2, using survey data from 522 employees working at home during the pandemic, we found that virtual work characteristics linked to worker's performance and well‐being via the experienced challenges. Specifically, social support was positively correlated with lower levels of all remote working challenges; job autonomy negatively related to loneliness; workload and monitoring both linked to higher work‐home interference; and workload additionally linked to lower procrastination. Self‐discipline was a significant moderator of several of these relationships. We discuss the implications of our research for the pandemic and beyond.",2020-10-14,2020,Bin Wang; Yukun Liu; Jing Qian; Sharon K.

W3080253043,Connecting the Dots: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Graph Neural Networks,"Modeling multivariate time series has long been a subject that has attracted researchers from a diverse range of fields including economics, finance, and traffic. A basic assumption behind multivariate time series forecasting is that its variables depend on one another but, upon looking closely, it is fair to say that existing methods fail to fully exploit latent spatial dependencies between pairs of variables. In recent years, meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown high capability in handling relational dependencies. GNNs require well-defined graph structures for information propagation which means they cannot be applied directly for multivariate time series where the dependencies are not known in advance. In this paper, we propose a general graph neural network framework designed specifically for multivariate time series data. Our approach automatically extracts the uni-directed relations among variables through a graph learning module, into which external knowledge like variable attributes can be easily integrated. A novel mix-hop propagation layer and a dilated inception layer are further proposed to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies within the time series. The graph learning, graph convolution, and temporal convolution modules are jointly learned in an end-to-end framework. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on 3 of 4 benchmark datasets and achieves on-par performance with other approaches on two traffic datasets which provide extra structural information.",2020-08-20,2020,Zonghan Wu; Shirui Pan; Guodong Long; Jing Jiang; Xiaojun Chang,University of Technology Sydney,,1241,https://doi.org/10.1145/3394486.3403118,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Multivariate statistics; Graph; Data mining; Time series,0.7

One recent phenomenon is ChatGPT, a chatbot with a conversational artificial intelligence interface that was developed by OpenAI. As one of the most advanced artificial intelligence applications, ChatGPT has drawn much public attention across the globe. In this regard, this study examines ChatGPT in education, among early adopters, through a qualitative instrumental case study. Conducted in three stages, the first stage of the study reveals that the public discourse in social media is generally positive and there is enthusiasm regarding its use in educational settings. However, there are also voices who are approaching cautiously using ChatGPT in educational settings. The second stage of the study examines the case of ChatGPT through lenses of educational transformation, response quality, usefulness, personality and emotion, and ethics. In the third and final stage of the study, the investigation of user experiences through ten educational scenarios revealed various issues, including cheating, honesty and truthfulness of ChatGPT, privacy misleading, and manipulation.

W3048804154,The k-means Algorithm: A Comprehensive Survey and Performance Evaluation,"The k-means clustering algorithm is considered one of the most powerful and popular data mining algorithms in the research community. However, despite its popularity, the algorithm has certain limitations, including problems associated with random initialization of the centroids which leads to unexpected convergence. Additionally, such a clustering algorithm requires the number of clusters to be defined beforehand, which is responsible for different cluster shapes and outlier effects. A fundamental problem of the k-means algorithm is its inability to handle various data types. This paper provides a structured and synoptic overview of research conducted on the k-means algorithm to overcome such shortcomings. Variants of the k-means algorithms including their recent developments are discussed, where their effectiveness is investigated based on the experimental analysis of a variety of datasets. The detailed experimental analysis along with a thorough comparison among different k-means clustering algorithms differentiates our work compared to other existing survey papers. Furthermore, it outlines a clear and thorough understanding of the k-means algorithm along with its different research directions.",2020-08-12,2020,Mohiuddin Ahmed; Raihan Seraj; Syed Mohammed Shamsul Islam,Edith Cowan University,Electronics,1118,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics9081295,AI_Machine_Learning,Cluster analysis; Computer science; Data mining; Algorithm; Convergence (economics),0.492

W3014420450,From digital literacy to digital competence: the teacher digital competency (TDC) framework,"Abstract Over the years, a variety of frameworks, models and literacies have been developed to guide teacher educators in their efforts to build digital capabilities in their students, that will support them to use new and emerging technologies in their future classrooms. Generally, these focus on advancing students’ skills in using ‘educational’ applications and digitally-sourced information, or understanding effective blends of pedagogical, content and technological knowledge seen as supporting the integration of digital resources into teaching, to enhance subject learning outcomes. Within teacher education institutions courses developing these capabilities are commonly delivered as standalone entities, or there is an assumption that they will be generated by technology’s integration in other disciplines or through mandated assessment. However, significant research exists suggesting the current narrow focus on subject-related technical and information skills does not prepare students adequately with the breadth of knowledge and capabilities needed in today’s classrooms, and beyond. This article presents a conceptual framework introducing an expanded view of teacher digital competence (TDC). It moves beyond prevailing technical and literacies conceptualisations, arguing for more holistic and broader-based understandings that recognise the increasingly complex knowledge and skills young people need to function ethically, safely and productively in diverse, digitally-mediated environments. The implications of the framework are discussed, with specific reference to its interdisciplinary nature and the requirement of all faculty to engage purposefully and deliberately in delivering its objectives. Practical suggestions on how the framework might be used by faculty, are presented.",2020-03-29,2020,Garry Falloon,Macquarie University,Educational Technology Research and Development,931,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-020-09767-4,AI_Machine_Learning,Competence (human resources); Conceptual framework; Variety (cybernetics); Digital literacy; Information literacy,0.508
W3084021717,"Vision, challenges, roles and research issues of Artificial Intelligence in Education","The rapid advancement of computing technologies has facilitated the implementation of AIED (Artificial Intelligence in Education) applications. AIED refers to the use of AI (Artificial Intelligence) technologies or application programs in educational settings to facilitate teaching, learning, or decision making. With the help of AI technologies, which simulate human intelligence to make inferences, judgments, or predictions, computer systems can provide personalized guidance, supports, or feedback to students as well as assisting teachers or policymakers in making decisions. Although AIED has been identified as the primary research focus in the field of computers and education, the interdisciplinary nature of AIED presents a unique challenge for researchers with different disciplinary backgrounds. In this paper, we present the definition and roles of AIED studies from the perspective of educational needs. We propose a framework to show the considerations of implementing AIED in different learning and teaching settings. The structure can help guide researchers with both computers and education backgrounds in conducting AIED studies. We outline 10 potential research topics in AIED that are of particular interest to this journal. Finally, we describe the type of articles we like to solicit and the management of the submissions.",2020-01-01,2020,Gwo‐Jen Hwang; Haoran Xie; Benjamin W.

W3185076117,Artificial gorilla troops optimizer: A new nature‐inspired metaheuristic algorithm for global optimization problems,"Metaheuristics play a critical role in solving optimization problems, and most of them have been inspired by the collective intelligence of natural organisms in nature. This paper proposes a new metaheuristic algorithm inspired by gorilla troops' social intelligence in nature, called Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimizer (GTO). In this algorithm, gorillas' collective life is mathematically formulated, and new mechanisms are designed to perform exploration and exploitation. To evaluate the GTO, we apply it to 52 standard benchmark functions and seven engineering problems. Friedman's test and Wilcoxon rank-sum statistical tests statistically compared the proposed method with several existing metaheuristics. The results demonstrate that the GTO performs better than comparative algorithms on most benchmark functions, particularly on high-dimensional problems. The results demonstrate that the GTO can provide superior results compared with other metaheuristics.",2021-07-12,2021,Benyamın Abdollahzadeh; Farhad Soleimanian Gharehchopogh; Seyedali Mirjalili,Torrens University Australia,International Journal of Intelligent Systems,861,https://doi.org/10.1002/int.22535,AI_Machine_Learning,Metaheuristic; Benchmark (surveying); Computer science; Swarm intelligence; Mathematical optimization,0.283
W4205129187,Particle Swarm Optimization: A Comprehensive Survey,"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the most well-regarded swarm-based algorithms in the literature. Although the original PSO has shown good optimization performance, it still severely suffers from premature convergence. As a result, many researchers have been modifying it resulting in a large number of PSO variants with either slightly or significantly better performance. Mainly, the standard PSO has been modified by four main strategies: modification of the PSO controlling parameters, hybridizing PSO with other well-known meta-heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE), cooperation and multi-swarm techniques. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive review of PSO, including the basic concepts of PSO, binary PSO, neighborhood topologies in PSO, recent and historical PSO variants, remarkable engineering applications of PSO, and its drawbacks. Moreover, this paper reviews recent studies that utilize PSO to solve feature selection problems.

W4360980141,Examining Science Education in ChatGPT: An Exploratory Study of Generative Artificial Intelligence,"Abstract The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential in the field of education. The study explores three main areas: (1) How did ChatGPT answer questions related to science education? (2) What are some ways educators could utilise ChatGPT in their science pedagogy? and (3) How has ChatGPT been utilised in this study, and what are my reflections about its use as a research tool? This exploratory research applies a self-study methodology to investigate the technology. Impressively, ChatGPT’s output often aligned with key themes in the research. However, as it currently stands, ChatGPT runs the risk of positioning itself as the ultimate epistemic authority, where a single truth is assumed without a proper grounding in evidence or presented with sufficient qualifications. Key ethical concerns associated with AI include its potential environmental impact, issues related to content moderation, and the risk of copyright infringement. It is important for educators to model responsible use of ChatGPT, prioritise critical thinking, and be clear about expectations. ChatGPT is likely to be a useful tool for educators designing science units, rubrics, and quizzes. Educators should critically evaluate any AI-generated resource and adapt it to their specific teaching contexts. ChatGPT was used as a research tool for assistance with editing and to experiment with making the research narrative clearer. The intention of the paper is to act as a catalyst for a broader conversation about the use of generative AI in science education.",2023-03-22,2023,Grant Cooper,Curtin University,Journal of Science Education and Technology,832,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10956-023-10039-y,AI_Machine_Learning,Transformative learning; Science education; Rubric; Engineering ethics; Narrative,0.55
W3034303554,Circle Loss: A Unified Perspective of Pair Similarity Optimization,"This paper provides a pair similarity optimization viewpoint on deep feature learning, aiming to maximize the within-class similarity $s_p$ and minimize the between-class similarity $s_n$. We find a majority of loss functions, including the triplet loss and the softmax cross-entropy loss, embed $s_n$ and $s_p$ into similarity pairs and seek to reduce $(s_n-s_p)$. Such an optimization manner is inflexible, because the penalty strength on every single similarity score is restricted to be equal. Our intuition is that if a similarity score deviates far from the optimum, it should be emphasized. To this end, we simply re-weight each similarity to highlight the less-optimized similarity scores. It results in a Circle loss, which is named due to its circular decision boundary. The Circle loss has a unified formula for two elemental deep feature learning paradigms, \emph {i.e.}, learning with class-level labels and pair-wise labels. Analytically, we show that the Circle loss offers a more flexible optimization approach towards a more definite convergence target, compared with the loss functions optimizing $(s_n-s_p)$. Experimentally, we demonstrate the superiority of the Circle loss on a variety of deep feature learning tasks. On face recognition, person re-identification, as well as several fine-grained image retrieval datasets, the achieved performance is on par with the state of the art.",2020-06-01,2020,Yifan Sun; Changmao Cheng; Yuhan Zhang; Chi Zhang; Liang Zheng,Australian National University,2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),799,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr42600.2020.00643,AI_Machine_Learning,Softmax function; Similarity (geometry); Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Feature (linguistics),0.208
W4225716729,"AI-Based Modeling: Techniques, Applications and Research Issues Towards Automation, Intelligent and Smart Systems","Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) is a leading technology of the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0 or 4IR), with the capability of incorporating human behavior and intelligence into machines or systems. Thus, AI-based modeling is the key to build automated, intelligent, and smart systems according to today’s needs. To solve real-world issues, various types of AI such as analytical, functional, interactive, textual, and visual AI can be applied to enhance the intelligence and capabilities of an application. However, developing an effective AI model is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature and variation in real-world problems and data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on “AI-based Modeling” with the principles and capabilities of potential AI techniques that can play an important role in developing intelligent and smart systems in various real-world application areas including business, finance, healthcare, agriculture, smart cities, cybersecurity and many more. We also emphasize and highlight the research issues within the scope of our study.

They consist of a checklist of information to include in publications describing in vivo experiments to enable others to scrutinise the work adequately, evaluate its methodological rigour, and reproduce the methods and results. Despite considerable levels of endorsement by funders and journals over the years, adherence to the guidelines has been inconsistent, and the anticipated improvements in the quality of reporting in animal research publications have not been achieved. Here, we introduce ARRIVE 2.0. The guidelines have been updated and information reorganised to facilitate their use in practice. We used a Delphi exercise to prioritise and divide the items of the guidelines into 2 sets, the “ARRIVE Essential 10,” which constitutes the minimum requirement, and the “Recommended Set,” which describes the research context. This division facilitates improved reporting of animal research by supporting a stepwise approach to implementation. This helps journal editors and reviewers verify that the most important items are being reported in manuscripts. We have also developed the accompanying Explanation and Elaboration (E&amp;E) document, which serves (1) to explain the rationale behind each item in the guidelines, (2) to clarify key concepts, and (3) to provide illustrative examples.

W3096561213,GraphDTA: predicting drug–target binding affinity with graph neural networks,"Abstract Summary The development of new drugs is costly, time consuming and often accompanied with safety issues. Drug repurposing can avoid the expensive and lengthy process of drug development by finding new uses for already approved drugs. In order to repurpose drugs effectively, it is useful to know which proteins are targeted by which drugs. Computational models that estimate the interaction strength of new drug–target pairs have the potential to expedite drug repurposing. Several models have been proposed for this task. However, these models represent the drugs as strings, which is not a natural way to represent molecules. We propose a new model called GraphDTA that represents drugs as graphs and uses graph neural networks to predict drug–target affinity. We show that graph neural networks not only predict drug–target affinity better than non-deep learning models, but also outperform competing deep learning methods. Our results confirm that deep learning models are appropriate for drug–target binding affinity prediction, and that representing drugs as graphs can lead to further improvements. Availability of implementation The proposed models are implemented in Python. Related data, pre-trained models and source code are publicly available at https://github.com/thinng/GraphDTA.

W2887063112,Automatically Designing CNN Architectures Using the Genetic Algorithm for Image Classification,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained a remarkable success on many image classification tasks in recent years. However, the performance of CNNs highly relies upon their architectures. For most state-of-the-art CNNs, their architectures are often manually-designed with expertise in both CNNs and the investigated problems. Therefore, it is difficult for users, who have no extended expertise in CNNs, to design optimal CNN architectures for their own image classification problems of interest. In this paper, we propose an automatic CNN architecture design method by using genetic algorithms, to effectively address the image classification tasks. The most merit of the proposed algorithm remains in its ""automatic"" characteristic that users do not need domain knowledge of CNNs when using the proposed algorithm, while they can still obtain a promising CNN architecture for the given images. The proposed algorithm is validated on widely used benchmark image classification datasets, by comparing to the state-of-the-art peer competitors covering eight manually-designed CNNs, seven automatic+manually tuning and five automatic CNN architecture design algorithms. The experimental results indicate the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing automatic CNN architecture design algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, parameter numbers and consumed computational resources. The proposed algorithm also shows the very comparable classification accuracy to the best one from manually-designed and automatic+manually tuning CNNs, while consumes much less of computational resource.",2020-04-21,2020,Yanan Sun; Bing Xue; Mengjie Zhang; Gary G.

W3004519387,Porous scaffolds for bone regeneration,"Globally, bone fractures due to osteoporosis occur every 20 s in people aged over 50 years. The significant healthcare costs required to manage this problem are further exacerbated by the long healing times experienced with current treatment practices. Novel treatment approaches such as tissue engineering, is using biomaterial scaffolds to stimulate and guide the regeneration of damaged tissue that cannot heal spontaneously. Scaffolds provide a three-dimensional network that mimics the extra cellular micro-environment supporting the viability, attachment, growth and migration of cells whilst maintaining the structure of the regenerated tissue in vivo. The osteogenic capability of the scaffold is influenced by the interconnections between the scaffold pores which facilitate cell distribution, integration with the host tissue and capillary ingrowth. Hence, the preparation of bone scaffolds with applicable pore size and interconnectivity is a significant issue in bone tissue engineering. To be effective however in vivo, the scaffold must also cope with the requirements for physiological mechanical loading. This review focuses on the relationship between the porosity and pore size of scaffolds and subsequent osteogenesis, vascularisation and scaffold degradation during bone regeneration.",2020-02-07,2020,Naghmeh Abbasi; Stephen Hamlet; Robert Love; Nam‐Trung Nguyen,Griffith University,Journal of Science Advanced Materials and Devices,733,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsamd.2020.01.007,AI_Machine_Learning,Scaffold; Interconnectivity; Materials science; Regeneration (biology); Biomedical engineering,0.358

Here, we introduce DeepFRI, a Graph Convolutional Network for predicting protein functions by leveraging sequence features extracted from a protein language model and protein structures. It outperforms current leading methods and sequence-based Convolutional Neural Networks and scales to the size of current sequence repositories. Augmenting the training set of experimental structures with homology models allows us to significantly expand the number of predictable functions. DeepFRI has significant de-noising capability, with only a minor drop in performance when experimental structures are replaced by protein models. Class activation mapping allows function predictions at an unprecedented resolution, allowing site-specific annotations at the residue-level in an automated manner. We show the utility and high performance of our method by annotating structures from the PDB and SWISS-MODEL, making several new confident function predictions.

W4322617812,Generative AI and the future of education: Ragnarök or reformation? A paradoxical perspective from management educators,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm, with notable tension transpiring in the field of education. Given that Generative AI is rapidly emerging as a transformative innovation, this article endeavors to offer a seminal rejoinder that aims to (i) reconcile the great debate on Generative AI in order to (ii) lay the foundation for Generative AI to co-exist as a transformative resource in the future of education. Using critical analysis as a method and paradox theory as a theoretical lens (i.e., the ""how""), this article (i) defines Generative AI and transformative education (i.e., the ""ideas""), (ii) establishes the paradoxes of Generative AI (i.e., the ""what""), and (iii) provides implications for the future of education from the perspective of management educators (i.e., the ""so what""). Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative AI are four-fold: (Paradox #1) Generative AI is a 'friend' yet a 'foe', (Paradox #2) Generative AI is 'capable' yet 'dependent', (Paradox #3) Generative AI is 'accessible' yet 'restrictive', and (Paradox #4) Generative AI gets even 'popular' when 'banned' (i.e., the ""what""). Through a position that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative AI, the lessons and implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should be useful for approaching Generative AI as a game-changer for education reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by extension, mitigating a situation where Generative AI develops into a Ragnarök that dooms the future of education of which management education is a part of (i.e., the ""so what"").",2023-03-01,2023,Weng Marc Lim; Asanka Gunasekara; Jessica L.

Virus, bacteria and fungi can all cause pneumonia. However, it is difficult to judge the pneumonia just by looking at chest X-rays. The aim of this study is to simplify the pneumonia detection process for experts as well as for novices. We suggest a novel deep learning framework for the detection of pneumonia using the concept of transfer learning. In this approach, features from images are extracted using different neural network models pretrained on ImageNet, which then are fed into a classifier for prediction. We prepared five different models and analyzed their performance. Thereafter, we proposed an ensemble model that combines outputs from all pretrained models, which outperformed individual models, reaching the state-of-the-art performance in pneumonia recognition. Our ensemble model reached an accuracy of 96.4% with a recall of 99.62% on unseen data from the Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center dataset.",2020-01-12,2020,V. S.

W3018428404,Beyond a tandem analysis of SEM and PROCESS: Use of PLS-SEM for mediation analyses!,"Mediation and conditional process analyses have become popular approaches for examining the mechanisms by which effects operate and the factors that influence them. To estimate mediation models, researchers often augment their structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses with additional regression analyses using the PROCESS macro. This duality is surprising considering that research has long acknowledged the limitations of regression analyses when estimating models with latent variables. In this article, we argue that much of the confusion regarding SEM’s efficacy for mediation analyses results from a singular focus on factor-based methods, and there is no need for a tandem use of SEM and PROCESS. Specifically, we highlight that composite-based SEM methods overcome the limitations of both regression and factor-based SEM analyses when estimating even highly complex mediation models. We further conclude that composite-based SEM methods such as partial least squares (PLS-SEM) are the preferred and superior approach when estimating mediation and conditional process models, and that the PROCESS approach is not needed when mediation is examined with PLS-SEM.",2020-04-26,2020,Marko Sarstedt; Joseph F.

W3156313549,Classification of Skin Disease Using Deep Learning Neural Networks with MobileNet V2 and LSTM,"Deep learning models are efficient in learning the features that assist in understanding complex patterns precisely. This study proposed a computerized process of classifying skin disease through deep learning based MobileNet V2 and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The MobileNet V2 model proved to be efficient with a better accuracy that can work on lightweight computational devices. The proposed model is efficient in maintaining stateful information for precise predictions. A grey-level co-occurrence matrix is used for assessing the progress of diseased growth. The performance has been compared against other state-of-the-art models such as Fine-Tuned Neural Networks (FTNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition developed by Visual Geometry Group (VGG), and convolutional neural network architecture that expanded with few changes. The HAM10000 dataset is used and the proposed method has outperformed other methods with more than 85% accuracy. Its robustness in recognizing the affected region much faster with almost 2× lesser computations than the conventional MobileNet model results in minimal computational efforts. Furthermore, a mobile application is designed for instant and proper action. It helps the patient and dermatologists identify the type of disease from the affected region's image at the initial stage of the skin disease.

W3129603262,Student Motivation and Associated Outcomes: A Meta-Analysis From Self-Determination Theory,"Student outcomes are influenced by different types of motivation that stem from external incentives, ego involvement, personal value, and intrinsic interest. The types of motivation described in self-determination theory each co-occur to different degrees and should lead to different consequences. The associations with outcomes are due in part to unique characteristics and in part to the degree of autonomy each entails. In the current meta-analysis, we examine these different types of motivation in 344 samples (223,209 participants) as they relate to 26 performance, well-being, goal orientation, and persistence-related student outcomes. Findings highlight that intrinsic motivation is related to student success and well-being, whereas personal value (identified regulation) is particularly highly related to persistence. Ego-involved motives (introjected regulation) were positively related to persistence and performance goals but also positively related with indicators of ill-being. Motivation driven by a desire to obtain rewards or avoid punishment (external regulation) was not associated with performance or persistence but was associated with decreased well-being. Finally, amotivation was related to poor outcomes. Relative weights analysis further estimates the degree to which motivation types uniquely predict outcomes, highlighting that identified regulation and intrinsic motivation are likely key factors for school adjustment.",2021-02-16,2021,Joshua L.

W3214625971,Climate change and COP26: Are digital technologies and information management part of the problem or the solution? An editorial reflection and call to action,"The UN COP26 2021 conference on climate change offers the chance for world leaders to take action and make urgent and meaningful commitments to reducing emissions and limit global temperatures to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2050. Whilst the political aspects and subsequent ramifications of these fundamental and critical decisions cannot be underestimated, there exists a technical perspective where digital and IS technology has a role to play in the monitoring of potential solutions, but also an integral element of climate change solutions. We explore these aspects in this editorial article, offering a comprehensive opinion based insight to a multitude of diverse viewpoints that look at the many challenges through a technology lens. It is widely recognized that technology in all its forms, is an important and integral element of the solution, but industry and wider society also view technology as being part of the problem. Increasingly, researchers are referencing the importance of responsible digitalization to eliminate the significant levels of e-waste. The reality is that technology is an integral component of the global efforts to get to net zero, however, its adoption requires pragmatic tradeoffs as we transition from current behaviors to a more climate friendly society.",2021-11-24,2021,Yogesh K.

W3014138823,Factors Associated With Virtual Reality Sickness in Head-Mounted Displays: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"The use of head-mounted displays (HMD) for virtual reality (VR) application-based purposes including therapy, rehabilitation, and training is increasing. Despite advancements in VR technologies, many users still experience sickness symptoms. VR sickness may be influenced by technological differences within HMDs such as resolution and refresh rate, however, VR content also plays a significant role. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the literature on HMDs that report Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) scores to determine the impact of content. User factors associated with VR sickness were also examined. A systematic search was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Fifty-five articles met inclusion criteria, representing 3,016 participants (mean age range 19.5-80; 41% female). Findings show gaming content recorded the highest total SSQ mean 34.26 (95%CI 29.57-38.95). VR sickness profiles were also influenced by visual stimulation, locomotion and exposure times. Older samples (mean age ≥35 years) scored significantly lower total SSQ means than younger samples, however, these findings are based on a small evidence base as a limited number of studies included older users. No sex differences were found. Across all types of content, the pooled total SSQ mean was relatively high 28.00 (95%CI 24.66-31.35) compared with recommended SSQ cut-off scores. These findings are of relevance for informing future research and the application of VR in different contexts.",2020-03-31,2020,Dimitrios Saredakis; Ancrêt Szpak; Brandon Birckhead; Hannah A. D.

W3100928534,GW190814: Gravitational Waves from the Coalescence of a 23 Solar Mass Black Hole with a 2.6 Solar Mass Compact Object,"Abstract We report the observation of a compact binary coalescence involving a 22.2–24.3 M ⊙ black hole and a compact object with a mass of 2.50–2.67 M ⊙ (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The gravitational-wave signal, GW190814, was observed during LIGO’s and Virgo’s third observing run on 2019 August 14 at 21:10:39 UTC and has a signal-to-noise ratio of 25 in the three-detector network. The source was localized to 18.5 deg 2 at a distance of Mpc; no electromagnetic counterpart has been confirmed to date. The source has the most unequal mass ratio yet measured with gravitational waves, , and its secondary component is either the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system. The dimensionless spin of the primary black hole is tightly constrained to ≤0.07. Tests of general relativity reveal no measurable deviations from the theory, and its prediction of higher-multipole emission is confirmed at high confidence. We estimate a merger rate density of 1–23 Gpc −3 yr −1 for the new class of binary coalescence sources that GW190814 represents. Astrophysical models predict that binaries with mass ratios similar to this event can form through several channels, but are unlikely to have formed in globular clusters. However, the combination of mass ratio, component masses, and the inferred merger rate for this event challenges all current models of the formation and mass distribution of compact-object binaries.",2020-06-01,2020,R.

Specifically, the dataset has been generated using a purpose-built IoT/IIoT testbed with a large representative set of devices, sensors, protocols and cloud/edge configurations. The IoT data are generated from various IoT devices (more than 10 types) such as Low-cost digital sensors for sensing temperature and humidity, Ultrasonic sensor, Water level detection sensor, pH Sensor Meter, Soil Moisture sensor, Heart Rate Sensor, Flame Sensor, etc.). Furthermore, we identify and analyze fourteen attacks related to IoT and IIoT connectivity protocols, which are categorized into five threats, including, DoS/DDoS attacks, Information gathering, Man in the middle attacks, Injection attacks, and Malware attacks. In addition, we extract features obtained from different sources, including alerts, system resources, logs, network traffic, and propose new 61 features with high correlations from 1176 found features. After processing and analyzing the proposed realistic cyber security dataset, we provide a primary exploratory data analysis and evaluate the performance of machine learning approaches (i.e., traditional machine learning as well as deep learning) in both centralized and federated learning modes.

W3169902780,The Colony Predation Algorithm,"Abstract This paper proposes a new stochastic optimizer called the Colony Predation Algorithm (CPA) based on the corporate predation of animals in nature. CPA utilizes a mathematical mapping following the strategies used by animal hunting groups, such as dispersing prey, encircling prey, supporting the most likely successful hunter, and seeking another target. Moreover, the proposed CPA introduces new features of a unique mathematical model that uses a success rate to adjust the strategy and simulate hunting animals’ selective abandonment behavior. This paper also presents a new way to deal with cross-border situations, whereby the optimal position value of a cross-border situation replaces the cross-border value to improve the algorithm’s exploitation ability. The proposed CPA was compared with state-of-the-art metaheuristics on a comprehensive set of benchmark functions for performance verification and on five classical engineering design problems to evaluate the algorithm’s efficacy in optimizing engineering problems. The results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits competitive, superior performance in different search landscapes over the other algorithms. Moreover, the source code of the CPA will be publicly available after publication.",2021-05-01,2021,Jiaze Tu; Huiling Chen; Mingjing Wang; Amir H.

W4327918021,ChatGPT in higher education: Considerations for academic integrity and student learning,"The release of ChatGPT has sparked significant academic integrity concerns in higher education. However, some commentators have pointed out that generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT can enhance student learning. Consequently, academics should adapt their teaching and assessment practices to embrace the new reality of living, working, and studying in a world where AI is freely available. Despite this important debate, very little academic literature has been published on ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. This article uses content analysis to examine news articles (N=100) about how ChatGPT is disrupting higher education, concentrating specifically on Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. It explores several key themes, including university responses, academic integrity concerns, the limitations and weaknesses of AI tool outputs, and opportunities for student learning. The data reveals mixed public discussion and university responses, with a focus mainly on academic integrity concerns and opportunities for innovative assessment design. There has also been a lack of public discussion about the potential for ChatGPT to enhance participation and success for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Similarly, the students’ voice is poorly represented in media articles to date.

One of the promising applications of machine learning is in precision medicine, where disease risk is predicted using patient genetic data. However, creating an accurate prediction model based on genotype data remains challenging due to the so-called “curse of dimensionality” (i.e., extensively larger number of features compared to the number of samples). Therefore, the generalizability of machine learning models benefits from feature selection, which aims to extract only the most “informative” features and remove noisy “non-informative,” irrelevant and redundant features. In this article, we provide a general overview of the different feature selection methods, their advantages, disadvantages, and use cases, focusing on the detection of relevant features (i.e., SNPs) for disease risk prediction.",2022-06-27,2022,Nicholas Pudjihartono; Tayaza Fadason; Andreas W.

W4383913712,Human resource management in the age of generative artificial intelligence: Perspectives and research directions on ChatGPT,"Abstract ChatGPT and its variants that use generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have rapidly become a focal point in academic and media discussions about their potential benefits and drawbacks across various sectors of the economy, democracy, society, and environment. It remains unclear whether these technologies result in job displacement or creation, or if they merely shift human labour by generating new, potentially trivial or practically irrelevant, information and decisions. According to the CEO of ChatGPT, the potential impact of this new family of AI technology could be as big as “the printing press”, with significant implications for employment, stakeholder relationships, business models, and academic research, and its full consequences are largely undiscovered and uncertain. The introduction of more advanced and potent generative AI tools in the AI market, following the launch of ChatGPT, has ramped up the “AI arms race”, creating continuing uncertainty for workers, expanding their business applications, while heightening risks related to well‐being, bias, misinformation, context insensitivity, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and security.

W3037669777,An Overview of Recent Advances in Coordinated Control of Multiple Autonomous Surface Vehicles,"Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) are marine vessels capable of performing various marine operations without a crew in a variety of cluttered and hostile water/ocean environments. For complex missions, there are increasing needs for deploying a fleet of ASVs instead of a single one to complete difficult tasks. Cooperative operations with a fleet of ASVs offer great advantages with enhanced capability and efficacy. Despite various application potentials, coordinated motion control of ASVs pose great challenges due to the multiplicity of ASVs, complexity of intravehicle interactions and fleet formation with collision avoidance requirements, and scarcity of communication bandwidths in sea environments. Coordinated control of multiple ASVs has received considerable attention in the last decade. This article provides an overview of recent advances in coordinated control of multiple ASVs. First, some challenging issues and scenarios in motion control of ASVs are presented. Next, coordinated control architecture and methods of multiple ASVs are briefly discussed. Then, recent results on trajectory-guided, path-guided, and target-guided coordinated control of multiple ASVs are reviewed in detail. Finally, several theoretical and technical issues are suggested to direct future investigations including network-based coordination, event-triggered coordination, collision-free coordination, optimization-based coordination, data-driven coordination of ASVs, and task-region-oriented coordination of multiple ASVs and autonomous underwater vehicles.",2020-06-23,2020,Zhouhua Peng; Jun Wang; Dan Wang; Qing‐Long Han,Swinburne University of Technology,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,517,https://doi.org/10.1109/tii.2020.3004343,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Trajectory; Unmanned surface vehicle; Underwater; Control (management),0.45

W4206609022,2022 roadmap on neuromorphic computing and engineering,"Modern computation based on von Neumann architecture is now a mature cutting-edge science. In the von Neumann architecture, processing and memory units are implemented as separate blocks interchanging data intensively and continuously. This data transfer is responsible for a large part of the power consumption. The next generation computer technology is expected to solve problems at the exascale with 1018 calculations each second. Even though these future computers will be incredibly powerful, if they are based on von Neumann type architectures, they will consume between 20 and 30 megawatts of power and will not have intrinsic physically built-in capabilities to learn or deal with complex data as our brain does. These needs can be addressed by neuromorphic computing systems which are inspired by the biological concepts of the human brain. This new generation of computers has the potential to be used for the storage and processing of large amounts of digital information with much lower power consumption than conventional processors. Among their potential future applications, an important niche is moving the control from data centers to edge devices. The aim of this roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of neuromorphic technology and provide an opinion on the challenges and opportunities that the future holds in the major areas of neuromorphic technology, namely materials, devices, neuromorphic circuits, neuromorphic algorithms, applications, and ethics. The roadmap is a collection of perspectives where leading researchers in the neuromorphic community provide their own view about the current state and the future challenges for each research area.

W4366091323,"Deep learning modelling techniques: current progress, applications, advantages, and challenges","Abstract Deep learning (DL) is revolutionizing evidence-based decision-making techniques that can be applied across various sectors. Specifically, it possesses the ability to utilize two or more levels of non-linear feature transformation of the given data via representation learning in order to overcome limitations posed by large datasets. As a multidisciplinary field that is still in its nascent phase, articles that survey DL architectures encompassing the full scope of the field are rather limited. Thus, this paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-art DL modelling techniques and provides insights into their advantages and challenges. It was found that many of the models exhibit a highly domain-specific efficiency and could be trained by two or more methods. However, training DL models can be very time-consuming, expensive, and requires huge samples for better accuracy. Since DL is also susceptible to deception and misclassification and tends to get stuck on local minima, improved optimization of parameters is required to create more robust models. Regardless, DL has already been leading to groundbreaking results in the healthcare, education, security, commercial, industrial, as well as government sectors. Some models, like the convolutional neural network (CNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN), recurrent neural network (RNN), recursive neural networks, and autoencoders, are frequently used, while the potential of other models remains widely unexplored. Pertinently, hybrid conventional DL architectures have the capacity to overcome the challenges experienced by conventional models.

W3112134271,The Future of Sensitivity Analysis: An essential discipline for systems modeling and policy support,"Sensitivity analysis (SA) is en route to becoming an integral part of mathematical modeling. The tremendous potential benefits of SA are, however, yet to be fully realized, both for advancing mechanistic and data-driven modeling of human and natural systems, and in support of decision making. In this perspective paper, a multidisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners revisit the current status of SA, and outline research challenges in regard to both theoretical frameworks and their applications to solve real-world problems. Six areas are discussed that warrant further attention, including (1) structuring and standardizing SA as a discipline, (2) realizing the untapped potential of SA for systems modeling, (3) addressing the computational burden of SA, (4) progressing SA in the context of machine learning, (5) clarifying the relationship and role of SA to uncertainty quantification, and (6) evolving the use of SA in support of decision making.

W3044285175,Hand Gesture Recognition Based on Computer Vision: A Review of Techniques,"Hand gestures are a form of nonverbal communication that can be used in several fields such as communication between deaf-mute people, robot control, human–computer interaction (HCI), home automation and medical applications. Research papers based on hand gestures have adopted many different techniques, including those based on instrumented sensor technology and computer vision. In other words, the hand sign can be classified under many headings, such as posture and gesture, as well as dynamic and static, or a hybrid of the two. This paper focuses on a review of the literature on hand gesture techniques and introduces their merits and limitations under different circumstances. In addition, it tabulates the performance of these methods, focusing on computer vision techniques that deal with the similarity and difference points, technique of hand segmentation used, classification algorithms and drawbacks, number and types of gestures, dataset used, detection range (distance) and type of camera used. This paper is a thorough general overview of hand gesture methods with a brief discussion of some possible applications.",2020-07-23,2020,Munir Oudah; Ali Al‐Naji; Javaan Chahl,University of South Australia,Journal of Imaging,491,https://doi.org/10.3390/jimaging6080073,AI_Machine_Learning,Gesture; Computer science; Gesture recognition; Artificial intelligence; Wired glove,0.7
W3185256938,Effect of Data Scaling Methods on Machine Learning Algorithms and Model Performance,"Heart disease, one of the main reasons behind the high mortality rate around the world, requires a sophisticated and expensive diagnosis process. In the recent past, much literature has demonstrated machine learning approaches as an opportunity to efficiently diagnose heart disease patients. However, challenges associated with datasets such as missing data, inconsistent data, and mixed data (containing inconsistent missing data both as numerical and categorical) are often obstacles in medical diagnosis. This inconsistency led to a higher probability of misprediction and a misled result. Data preprocessing steps like feature reduction, data conversion, and data scaling are employed to form a standard dataset—such measures play a crucial role in reducing inaccuracy in final prediction. This paper aims to evaluate eleven machine learning (ML) algorithms—Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest Classifier (RF), Gradient Boost (GB), AdaBoost (AB), Extra Tree Classifier (ET)—and six different data scaling methods—Normalization (NR), Standscale (SS), MinMax (MM), MaxAbs (MA), Robust Scaler (RS), and Quantile Transformer (QT) on a dataset comprising of information of patients with heart disease. The result shows that CART, along with RS or QT, outperforms all other ML algorithms with 100% accuracy, 100% precision, 99% recall, and 100% F1 score. The study outcomes demonstrate that the model’s performance varies depending on the data scaling method.",2021-07-24,2021,Md Manjurul Ahsan; M. A.

W3206604724,A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Anomaly Detection With Deep Learning,"Anomalies are rare observations (e.g., data records or events) that deviate significantly from the others in the sample. Over the past few decades, research on anomaly mining has received increasing interests due to the implications of these occurrences in a wide range of disciplines - for instance, security, finance, and medicine. For this reason, anomaly detection, which aims to identify these rare observations, has become one of the most vital tasks in the world and has shown its power in preventing detrimental events, such as financial fraud, network intrusions, and social spam. The detection task is typically solved by identifying outlying data points in the feature space, which, inherently, overlooks the relational information in real-world data. At the same time, graphs have been prevalently used to represent the structural/relational information, which raises the <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">graph anomaly detection problem</i> - identifying anomalous graph objects (i.e., nodes, edges and sub-graphs) in a single graph, or anomalous graphs in a set/database of graphs. Conventional anomaly detection techniques cannot tackle this problem well because of the complexity of graph data (e.g., irregular structures, relational dependencies, node/edge types/attributes/directions/multiplicities/weights, large scale, etc.). However, thanks to the advent of deep learning in breaking these limitations, graph anomaly detection with deep learning has received a growing attention recently. In this survey, we aim to provide a systematic and comprehensive review of the contemporary deep learning techniques for graph anomaly detection. Specifically, we provide a taxonomy that follows a task-driven strategy and categorizes existing work according to the anomalous graph objects that they can detect. We especially focus on the challenges in this research area and discuss the key intuitions, technical details as well as relative strengths and weaknesses of various techniques in each category. From the survey results, we highlight 12 future research directions spanning unsolved and emerging problems introduced by graph data, anomaly detection, deep learning and real-world applications. Additionally, to provide a wealth of useful resources for future studies, we have compiled a set of open-source implementations, public datasets, and commonly-used evaluation metrics. With this survey, our goal is to create a “one-stop-shop” that provides a unified understanding of the problem categories and existing approaches, publicly available hands-on resources, and high-impact open challenges for graph anomaly detection using deep learning.",2021-10-10,2021,Xiaoxiao Ma; Jia Wu; Shan Xue; Jian Yang; Chuan Zhou,Macquarie University,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,483,https://doi.org/10.1109/tkde.2021.3118815,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Anomaly detection; Graph; Data mining; Data science,0.642
W2999851651,Personalized Recommendation System Based on Collaborative Filtering for IoT Scenarios,"Recommendation technology is an important part of the Internet of Things (IoT) services, which can provide better service for users and help users get information anytime, anywhere. However, the traditional recommendation algorithms cannot meet user's fast and accurate recommended requirements in the IoT environment. In the face of a large-volume data, the method of finding neighborhood by comparing whole user information will result in a low recommendation efficiency. In addition, the traditional recommendation system ignores the inherent connection between user's preference and time. In reality, the interest of the user varies over time. Recommendation system should provide users accurate and fast with the change of time. To address this, we propose a novel recommendation model based on time correlation coefficient and an improved K-means with cuckoo search (CSK-means), called TCCF. The clustering method can cluster similar users together for further quick and accurate recommendation. Moreover, an effective and personalized recommendation model based on preference pattern (PTCCF) is designed to improve the quality of TCCF. It can provide a higher quality recommendation by analyzing the user's behaviors. The extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets of MovieLens and Douban, and the precision of our model have improved about 5.2 percent compared with the MCoC model. Systematic experimental results have demonstrated our models TCCF and PTCCF are effective for IoT scenarios.",2020-01-07,2020,Zhihua Cui; Xianghua Xu; Fei Xue; Xingjuan Cai; Yang Cao,Swinburne University of Technology,IEEE Transactions on Services Computing,479,https://doi.org/10.1109/tsc.2020.2964552,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; MovieLens; Collaborative filtering; Recommender system; Cluster analysis,0.625

W4365504037,"A survey on deep learning tools dealing with data scarcity: definitions, challenges, solutions, tips, and applications","Abstract Data scarcity is a major challenge when training deep learning (DL) models. DL demands a large amount of data to achieve exceptional performance. Unfortunately, many applications have small or inadequate data to train DL frameworks. Usually, manual labeling is needed to provide labeled data, which typically involves human annotators with a vast background of knowledge. This annotation process is costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. Usually, every DL framework is fed by a significant amount of labeled data to automatically learn representations. Ultimately, a larger amount of data would generate a better DL model and its performance is also application dependent. This issue is the main barrier for many applications dismissing the use of DL. Having sufficient data is the first step toward any successful and trustworthy DL application. This paper presents a holistic survey on state-of-the-art techniques to deal with training DL models to overcome three challenges including small, imbalanced datasets, and lack of generalization. This survey starts by listing the learning techniques. Next, the types of DL architectures are introduced. After that, state-of-the-art solutions to address the issue of lack of training data are listed, such as Transfer Learning (TL), Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Model Architecture (MA), Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), and Deep Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (DeepSMOTE). Then, these solutions were followed by some related tips about data acquisition needed prior to training purposes, as well as recommendations for ensuring the trustworthiness of the training dataset. The survey ends with a list of applications that suffer from data scarcity, several alternatives are proposed in order to generate more data in each application including Electromagnetic Imaging (EMI), Civil Structural Health Monitoring, Medical imaging, Meteorology, Wireless Communications, Fluid Mechanics, Microelectromechanical system, and Cybersecurity. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first review that offers a comprehensive overview on strategies to tackle data scarcity in DL.",2023-04-14,2023,Laith Alzubaidi; Jinshuai Bai; Aiman Al-Sabaawi; José Santamaría; A.

W3121216533,Efficient Prediction of Cardiovascular Disease Using Machine Learning Algorithms With Relief and LASSO Feature Selection Techniques,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are among the most common serious illnesses affecting human health. CVDs may be prevented or mitigated by early diagnosis, and this may reduce mortality rates. Identifying risk factors using machine learning models is a promising approach. We would like to propose a model that incorporates different methods to achieve effective prediction of heart disease. For our proposed model to be successful, we have used efficient Data Collection, Data Pre-processing and Data Transformation methods to create accurate information for the training model. We have used a combined dataset (Cleveland, Long Beach VA, Switzerland, Hungarian and Stat log). Suitable features are selected by using the Relief, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) techniques. New hybrid classifiers like Decision Tree Bagging Method (DTBM), Random Forest Bagging Method (RFBM), K-Nearest Neighbors Bagging Method (KNNBM), AdaBoost Boosting Method (ABBM), and Gradient Boosting Boosting Method (GBBM) are developed by integrating the traditional classifiers with bagging and boosting methods, which are used in the training process. We have also instrumented some machine learning algorithms to calculate the Accuracy (ACC), Sensitivity (SEN), Error Rate, Precision (PRE) and F1 Score (F1) of our model, along with the Negative Predictive Value (NPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), and False Negative Rate (FNR). The results are shown separately to provide comparisons.

Consequently, these diagnoses do not depict psychopathology accurately, and their validity in research and utility in clinicalpractice are therefore limited. The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) consortium proposed a model based on structural evidence. It addresses problems of diagnostic heterogeneity, comorbidity, and unreliability. We review the HiTOP model, supporting evidence, and conceptualization of psychopathology in this hierarchical dimensional framework. The system is not yet comprehensive, and we describe the processes for improving and expanding it. We summarize data on the ability of HiTOP to predict and explain etiology (genetic, environmental, and neurobiological), risk factors, outcomes, and treatment response. We describe progress in the development of HiTOP-based measures and in clinical implementation of the system. Finally, we review outstanding challenges and the research agenda.

W3156226702,Federated Learning Meets Blockchain in Edge Computing: Opportunities and Challenges,"Mobile-edge computing (MEC) has been envisioned as a promising paradigm to handle the massive volume of data generated from ubiquitous mobile devices for enabling intelligent services with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data collection and training in a single entity, e.g., an MEC server, which is now becoming a weak point due to data privacy concerns and high overhead of raw data communications. In this context, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to provide collaborative data training solutions, by coordinating multiple mobile devices to train a shared AI model without directly exposing their underlying data, which enjoys considerable privacy enhancement. To improve the security and scalability of FL implementation, blockchain as a ledger technology is attractive for realizing decentralized FL training without the need for any central server. Particularly, the integration of FL and blockchain leads to a new paradigm, called FLchain, which potentially transforms intelligent MEC networks into decentralized, secure, and privacy-enhancing systems. This article presents an overview of the fundamental concepts and explores the opportunities of FLchain in MEC networks. We identify several main issues in FLchain design, including communication cost, resource allocation, incentive mechanism, security and privacy protection. The key solutions and the lessons learned along with the outlooks are also discussed. Then, we investigate the applications of FLchain in popular MEC domains, such as edge data sharing, edge content caching and edge crowdsensing.

W3015014633,Deep-Learning-Enhanced Human Activity Recognition for Internet of Healthcare Things,"Along with the advancement of several emerging computing paradigms and technologies, such as cloud computing, mobile computing, artificial intelligence, and big data, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been applied in a variety of fields. In particular, the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is becoming increasingly important in human activity recognition (HAR) due to the rapid development of wearable and mobile devices. In this article, we focus on the deep-learning-enhanced HAR in IoHT environments. A semisupervised deep learning framework is designed and built for more accurate HAR, which efficiently uses and analyzes the weakly labeled sensor data to train the classifier learning model. To better solve the problem of the inadequately labeled sample, an intelligent autolabeling scheme based on deep Q-network (DQN) is developed with a newly designed distance-based reward rule which can improve the learning efficiency in IoT environments. A multisensor based data fusion mechanism is then developed to seamlessly integrate the on-body sensor data, context sensor data, and personal profile data together, and a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based classification method is proposed to identify fine-grained patterns according to the high-level features contextually extracted from the sequential motion data.

W3133543405,Evaluating the Quality of Machine Learning Explanations: A Survey on Methods and Metrics,"The most successful Machine Learning (ML) systems remain complex black boxes to end-users, and even experts are often unable to understand the rationale behind their decisions. The lack of transparency of such systems can have severe consequences or poor uses of limited valuable resources in medical diagnosis, financial decision-making, and in other high-stake domains. Therefore, the issue of ML explanation has experienced a surge in interest from the research community to application domains. While numerous explanation methods have been explored, there is a need for evaluations to quantify the quality of explanation methods to determine whether and to what extent the offered explainability achieves the defined objective, and compare available explanation methods and suggest the best explanation from the comparison for a specific task. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of methods proposed in the current literature for the evaluation of ML explanations. We identify properties of explainability from the review of definitions of explainability. The identified properties of explainability are used as objectives that evaluation metrics should achieve. The survey found that the quantitative metrics for both model-based and example-based explanations are primarily used to evaluate the parsimony/simplicity of interpretability, while the quantitative metrics for attribution-based explanations are primarily used to evaluate the soundness of fidelity of explainability. The survey also demonstrated that subjective measures, such as trust and confidence, have been embraced as the focal point for the human-centered evaluation of explainable systems. The paper concludes that the evaluation of ML explanations is a multidisciplinary research topic. It is also not possible to define an implementation of evaluation metrics, which can be applied to all explanation methods.",2021-03-04,2021,Jianlong Zhou; Amir H.

W3040304705,CCNet: Criss-Cross Attention for Semantic Segmentation,"Contextual information is vital in visual understanding problems, such as semantic segmentation and object detection. We propose a criss-cross network (CCNet) for obtaining full-image contextual information in a very effective and efficient way. Concretely, for each pixel, a novel criss-cross attention module harvests the contextual information of all the pixels on its criss-cross path. By taking a further recurrent operation, each pixel can finally capture the full-image dependencies. Besides, a category consistent loss is proposed to enforce the criss-cross attention module to produce more discriminative features. Overall, CCNet is with the following merits: 1) GPU memory friendly. Compared with the non-local block, the proposed recurrent criss-cross attention module requires 11× less GPU memory usage. 2) High computational efficiency. The recurrent criss-cross attention significantly reduces FLOPs by about 85 percent of the non-local block. 3) The state-of-the-art performance. We conduct extensive experiments on semantic segmentation benchmarks including Cityscapes, ADE20K, human parsing benchmark LIP, instance segmentation benchmark COCO, video segmentation benchmark CamVid. In particular, our CCNet achieves the mIoU scores of 81.9, 45.76 and 55.47 percent on the Cityscapes test set, the ADE20K validation set and the LIP validation set respectively, which are the new state-of-the-art results.

W4390692489,Unifying Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs: A Roadmap,"Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, are making new waves in the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, due to their emergent ability and generalizability. However, LLMs are black-box models, which often fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia and Huapu for example, are structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs can enhance LLMs by providing external knowledge for inference and interpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolve by nature, which challenges the existing methods in KGs to generate new facts and represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and KGs together and simultaneously leverage their advantages. In this article, we present a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs. Our roadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely, <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">1) KG-enhanced LLMs,</i> which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs, or for the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">2) LLM-augmented KGs,</i> that leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding, completion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question answering; and <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">3) Synergized LLMs + KGs</i> , in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a mutually beneficial way to enhance both LLMs and KGs for bidirectional reasoning driven by both data and knowledge.

The emergence of robots has attracted increasing interest from business scholars and practitioners alike. In this article, we undertake a systematic review of the business literature about the impact of service robots on customers and employees with the objective of guiding future research. Design/methodology/approach We analyzed the literature on service robots as they relate to customers and employees in business journals listed in the Financial Times top 50 journals plus all journals covered in the cross-disciplinary SERVSIG literature alerts. Findings The analysis of the identified studies yielded multiple observations about the impact of service robots on customers (e.g. overarching frameworks on acceptance and usage of service robots; characteristics of service robots and anthropomorphism; and potential for enhanced and deteriorated service experiences) and service employees (e.g. employee benefits such as reduced routine work, enhanced productivity and job satisfaction; potential negative consequences such as loss of autonomy and a range of negative psychological outcomes; opportunities for human–robot collaboration; job insecurity; and robot-related up-skilling and development requirements). We also conclude that current research on service robots is fragmented, is largely conceptual in nature and focused on the initial adoption stage. We feel that more research is needed to build an overarching theory. In addition, more empirical research is needed, especially on the long(er)-term usage service robots on actual behaviors, the well-being and potential downsides and (ethical) risks for customers and service employees.

W3115892855,Secure State Estimation and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems: A Survey,"Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) empower the integration of physical processes and cyber infrastructure with the aid of ubiquitous computation resources and communication capabilities. CPSs have permeated modern society and found extensive applications in a wide variety of areas, including energy, transportation, advanced manufacturing, and medical health. The security of CPSs against cyberattacks has been regarded as a long-standing concern. However, CPSs suffer from extendable vulnerabilities that are beyond classical networked systems due to the tight integration of cyber and physical components. Sophisticated and malicious cyberattacks continue to emerge to adversely impact CPS operation, resulting in performance degradation, service interruption, and system failure. Secure state estimation and control technologies play a vital role in warranting reliable monitoring and operation of safety-critical CPSs. This article provides a review of the state-of-the-art results for secure state estimation and control of CPSs. Specifically, the latest development of secure state estimation is summarized in light of different performance indicators and defense strategies. Then, the recent results on secure control are discussed and classified into three categories: 1) centralized secure control; 2) distributed secure control; and 3) resource-aware secure control. Furthermore, two specific application examples of water supply distribution systems and wide-area power systems are presented to demonstrate the applicability of secure state estimation and control approaches. Finally, several challenging issues are discussed to direct future research.",2020-12-22,2020,Derui Ding; Qing‐Long Han; Xiaohua Ge; Jun Wang,Swinburne University of Technology,IEEE Transactions on Systems Man and Cybernetics Systems,442,https://doi.org/10.1109/tsmc.2020.3041121,AI_Machine_Learning,Cyber-physical system; Computer security; Computer science; State (computer science); Control (management),0.733
W3156342878,Diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia from x-ray and CT images using deep learning and transfer learning algorithms,"The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) first appeared in Wuhan province of China and spread quickly around the globe and became a pandemic. The gold standard for confirming COVID-19 infection is through Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The lack of sufficient RT-PCR testing capacity, false negative results of RT-PCR, time to get back the results and other logistical constraints enabled the epidemic to continue to spread albeit interventions like regional or complete country lockdowns. Therefore, chest radiographs such as CT and X-ray can be used to supplement PCR in combating the virus from spreading. In this work, we focus on proposing a deep learning tool that can be used by radiologists or healthcare professionals to diagnose COVID-19 cases in a quick and accurate manner. However, the lack of a publicly available dataset of X-ray and CT images makes the design of such AI tools a challenging task. To this end, this study aims to build a comprehensive dataset of X-rays and CT scan images from multiple sources as well as provides a simple but an effective COVID-19 detection technique using deep learning and transfer learning algorithms. In this vein, a simple convolution neural network (CNN) and modified pre-trained AlexNet model are applied on the prepared X-rays and CT scan images. The result of the experiments shows that the utilized models can provide accuracy up to 98% via pre-trained network and 94.1% accuracy by using the modified CNN.",2021-04-09,2021,Halgurd S.

Adaptations to qualitative methods may be required to enable the use of timely and relevant qualitative data across multiple disciplinary settings. The aim of this review is to briefly explore the ways in which data collection and analysis methods have been adapted in qualitative research to deal with short study timeframes. We carried out a two-phased systematic review of the literature and determined there were six primary reasons why rapid techniques were used: (a) reduce time, (b) reduce cost, (c) increase the amount of collected data, (d) improve efficiency, (e) improve accuracy, and (f) obtain a closer approximation to the narrated realities of research participants.

W3192682950,A Survey on Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in many applications. The architectures of DNNs play a crucial role in their performance, which is usually manually designed with rich expertise. However, such a design process is labour intensive because of the trial-and-error process, and also not easy to realize due to the rare expertise in practice. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a type of technology that can design the architectures automatically. Among different methods to realize NAS, Evolutionary Computation (EC) methods have recently gained much attention and success. Unfortunately, there has not yet been a comprehensive summary of the EC-based NAS algorithms. This paper reviews over 200 papers of most recent EC-based NAS methods in light of the core components, to systematically discuss their design principles as well as justifications on the design.

W3011648816,Contributions and Risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Building Smarter Cities: Insights from a Systematic Review of the Literature,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. Interest in the use of AI for urban innovation continues to grow. Particularly, the rise of smart cities—urban locations that are enabled by community, technology, and policy to deliver productivity, innovation, livability, wellbeing, sustainability, accessibility, good governance, and good planning—has increased the demand for AI-enabled innovations. There is, nevertheless, no scholarly work that provides a comprehensive review on the topic. This paper generates insights into how AI can contribute to the development of smarter cities. A systematic review of the literature is selected as the methodologic approach. Results are categorized under the main smart city development dimensions, i.e., economy, society, environment, and governance. The findings of the systematic review containing 93 articles disclose that: (a) AI in the context of smart cities is an emerging field of research and practice. (b) The central focus of the literature is on AI technologies, algorithms, and their current and prospective applications. (c) AI applications in the context of smart cities mainly concentrate on business efficiency, data analytics, education, energy, environmental sustainability, health, land use, security, transport, and urban management areas.

W3033502887,SG-One: Similarity Guidance Network for One-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"One-shot image semantic segmentation poses a challenging task of recognizing the object regions from unseen categories with only one annotated example as supervision. In this article, we propose a simple yet effective similarity guidance network to tackle the one-shot (SG-One) segmentation problem. We aim at predicting the segmentation mask of a query image with the reference to one densely labeled support image of the same category. To obtain the robust representative feature of the support image, we first adopt a masked average pooling strategy for producing the guidance features by only taking the pixels belonging to the support image into account. We then leverage the cosine similarity to build the relationship between the guidance features and features of pixels from the query image. In this way, the possibilities embedded in the produced similarity maps can be adopted to guide the process of segmenting objects. Furthermore, our SG-One is a unified framework that can efficiently process both support and query images within one network and be learned in an end-to-end manner. We conduct extensive experiments on Pascal VOC 2012. In particular, our SG-One achieves the mIoU score of 46.3%, surpassing the baseline methods.",2020-06-04,2020,Xiaolin Zhang; Yunchao Wei; Yi Yang; Thomas S.

W3164008977,A Comprehensive Survey of Neural Architecture Search,"Deep learning has made substantial breakthroughs in many fields due to its powerful automatic representation capabilities. It has been proven that neural architecture design is crucial to the feature representation of data and the final performance. However, the design of the neural architecture heavily relies on the researchers’ prior knowledge and experience. And due to the limitations of humans’ inherent knowledge, it is difficult for people to jump out of their original thinking paradigm and design an optimal model. Therefore, an intuitive idea would be to reduce human intervention as much as possible and let the algorithm automatically design the neural architecture. Neural Architecture Search ( NAS ) is just such a revolutionary algorithm, and the related research work is complicated and rich. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic survey on the NAS is essential. Previously related surveys have begun to classify existing work mainly based on the key components of NAS: search space, search strategy, and evaluation strategy. While this classification method is more intuitive, it is difficult for readers to grasp the challenges and the landmark work involved. Therefore, in this survey, we provide a new perspective: beginning with an overview of the characteristics of the earliest NAS algorithms, summarizing the problems in these early NAS algorithms, and then providing solutions for subsequent related research work. In addition, we conduct a detailed and comprehensive analysis, comparison, and summary of these works. Finally, we provide some possible future research directions.",2021-05-24,2021,Pengzhen Ren; Yun Xiao; Xiaojun Chang; Po-Yao Huang; Zhihui Li,Monash University,ACM Computing Surveys,414,https://doi.org/10.1145/3447582,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Representation (politics); Machine learning,0.7

The implementation of qualitative research in the context of infectious epidemics, however, continues to lag behind in the delivery, credibility, and timeliness of findings when compared with other research designs. The purpose of this article is to reflect on our experience of carrying out three research studies (a rapid appraisal, a qualitative study based on interviews, and a mixed-methods survey) aimed at exploring health care delivery in the context of COVID-19.

W3134210100,Graph Self-Supervised Learning: A Survey,"Deep learning on graphs has attracted significant interests recently. However, most of the works have focused on (semi-) supervised learning, resulting in shortcomings including heavy label reliance, poor generalization, and weak robustness. To address these issues, self-supervised learning (SSL), which extracts informative knowledge through well-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels, has become a promising and trending learning paradigm for graph data. Different from SSL on other domains like computer vision and natural language processing, SSL on graphs has an exclusive background, design ideas, and taxonomies. Under the umbrella of graph self-supervised learning, we present a timely and comprehensive review of the existing approaches which employ SSL techniques for graph data. We construct a unified framework that mathematically formalizes the paradigm of graph SSL. According to the objectives of pretext tasks, we divide these approaches into four categories: generation-based, auxiliary property-based, contrast-based, and hybrid approaches. We further describe the applications of graph SSL across various research fields and summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation benchmark, performance comparison and open-source codes of graph SSL. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and potential future directions in this research field.",2022-01-01,2022,Yixin Liu; Ming Jin; Shirui Pan; Chuan Zhou; Yu Zheng,Monash University,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,412,https://doi.org/10.1109/tkde.2022.3172903,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Graph; Theoretical computer science,0.55
W3042149128,COVID-19’s impact on the hospitality workforce – new crisis or amplification of the norm?,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to highlight the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality workforce in situ between mid-April and June 2020. Design/methodology/approach This is a viewpoint paper that brings together a variety of sources and intelligence relating the impacts on hospitality work of the COVID-19 pandemic at three levels: macro (global, policy, government), meso (organisational) and micro (employee). It questions whether the situations faced by hospitality workers as a result of the pandemic are seed-change different from the precarious lives they normally lead or just a (loud) amplification of the “normal”. Findings In light of the fluid environment relating to COVID-19, conclusions are tentative and question whether hospitality stakeholders, particularly consumers, governments and the industry itself, will emerge from the pandemic with changed attitudes to hospitality work and hospitality workers. Practical implications This raises questions about hospitality work for key stakeholders to address in the future, some of which are systemic in terms of how precarious labour forces, critical to the global economy are to be considered by policy makers, organisations in a re-emerging competitive market for talent and for those who chose (or not) to work in hospitality. Social implications This paper contributes to ongoing debates about precarious work and the extent to which such practices are institutionalised and adopts an “amplification model” that may have value in futures-orientated analysis about hospitality and tourism. Originality/value This paper is wholly original and a reflection on the COVID-19 crisis. It provides a point of wider reference with regard to responses to crises and their impact on employment in hospitality, highlighting how ongoing change, fluidity and uncertainty serve to magnify and exacerbate the precarious nature of work in the industry.",2020-07-28,2020,Tom Baum; Shelagh Mooney; Richard Robinson; David Solnet,Auckland University of Technology,International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management,409,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijchm-04-2020-0314,AI_Machine_Learning,Hospitality; Workforce; Tourism; Originality; Public relations,0.358

The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot has caused alarm for practitioners seeking to detect authenticity of student work. Whereas some educational doomsayers predict the end of education in its current form, we propose an alternate early view. We identify in this commentary a position where educators can leverage AI like ChatGPT to build supportive learning environments for students who have cultivated good character. Such students know how to use ChatGPT for good, and can engage effectively with the ChatGPT application. In building our ChatGPT argument, we acknowledge the existing literature on plagiarism and academic integrity, and consider leadership as a root support mechanism, character development as an antidote, and authentic assessment as an enabler. In doing so, we highlight that while ChatGPT – like papermills, and degree factories before it – can be used to cheat on university exams, it can also be used to support deeper learning and better learning outcomes for students.

W4367182096,Participatory action research,"Participatory action research (PAR) is an approach to research that prioritizes the value of experiential knowledge for tackling problems caused by unequal and harmful social systems, and for envisioning and implementing alternatives. PAR involves the participation and leadership of those people experiencing issues, who take action to produce emancipatory social change, through conducting systematic research to generate new knowledge. This Primer sets out key considerations for the design of a PAR project. The core of the Primer introduces six building blocks for PAR project design: building relationships; establishing working practices; establishing a common understanding of the issue; observing, gathering and generating materials; collaborative analysis; and planning and taking action. We discuss key challenges faced by PAR projects, namely, mismatches with institutional research infrastructure; risks of co-option; power inequalities; and the decentralizing of control. To counter such challenges, PAR researchers may build PAR-friendly networks of people and infrastructures; cultivate a critical community to hold them to account; use critical reflexivity; redistribute powers; and learn to trust the process. PAR's societal contribution and methodological development, we argue, can best be advanced by engaging with contemporary social movements that demand the redressingl of inequities and the recognition of situated expertise. Participatory action research (PAR) involves the participation and leadership of people experiencing issues, who take action to produce emancipatory social change, through conducting systematic research to generate new knowledge.

W3168663926,Graph Attention Tracking,"Siamese network based trackers formulate the visual tracking task as a similarity matching problem. Almost all popular Siamese trackers realize the similarity learning via convolutional feature cross-correlation between a target branch and a search branch. However, since the size of target feature region needs to be pre-fixed, these cross-correlation base methods suffer from either reserving much adverse background information or missing a great deal of foreground information. Moreover, the global matching be-tween the target and search region also largely neglects the target structure and part-level information.In this paper, to solve the above issues, we propose a simple target-aware Siamese graph attention network for general object tracking. We propose to establish part-to-part correspondence between the target and the search region with a complete bipartite graph, and apply the graph attention mechanism to propagate target information from the template feature to the search feature. Further, instead of using the pre-fixed region cropping for template-feature-area selection, we investigate a target-aware area selection mechanism to fit the size and aspect ratio variations of different objects. Experiments on challenging benchmarks including GOT-10k, UAV123, OTB-100 and LaSOT demonstrate that the proposed SiamGAT outperforms many state-of-the-art trackers and achieves leading performance.

W3185693672,A Survey on Session-based Recommender Systems,"Recommender systems (RSs) have been playing an increasingly important role for informed consumption, services, and decision-making in the overloaded information era and digitized economy. In recent years, session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) have emerged as a new paradigm of RSs. Different from other RSs such as content-based RSs and collaborative filtering-based RSs that usually model long-term yet static user preferences, SBRSs aim to capture short-term but dynamic user preferences to provide more timely and accurate recommendations sensitive to the evolution of their session contexts. Although SBRSs have been intensively studied, neither unified problem statements for SBRSs nor in-depth elaboration of SBRS characteristics and challenges are available. It is also unclear to what extent SBRS challenges have been addressed and what the overall research landscape of SBRSs is. This comprehensive review of SBRSs addresses the above aspects by exploring in depth the SBRS entities (e.g., sessions), behaviours (e.g., users’ clicks on items), and their properties (e.g., session length). We propose a general problem statement of SBRSs, summarize the diversified data characteristics and challenges of SBRSs, and define a taxonomy to categorize the representative SBRS research.

W4296141059,Empirically grounded technology forecasts and the energy transition,"Rapidly decarbonizing the global energy system is critical for addressing climate change, but concerns about costs have been a barrier to implementation. Most energy-economy models have historically underestimated deployment rates for renewable energy technologies and overestimated their costs. These issues have driven calls for alternative approaches and more reliable technology forecasting methods. Here, we use an approach based on probabilistic cost forecasting methods that have been statistically validated by backtesting on more than 50 technologies. We generate probabilistic cost forecasts for solar energy, wind energy, batteries, and electrolyzers, conditional on deployment. We use these methods to estimate future energy system costs and explore how technology cost uncertainty propagates through to system costs in three different scenarios. Compared to continuing with a fossil fuel-based system, a rapid green energy transition will likely result in overall net savings of many trillions of dollars—even without accounting for climate damages or co-benefits of climate policy.",2022-09-01,2022,Rupert Way; Matthew C.

W3101718285,"Federated learning for 6G communications: Challenges, methods, and future directions","As the 5G communication networks are being widely deployed worldwide, both industry and academia have started to move beyond 5G and explore 6G communications. It is generally believed that 6G will be established on ubiquitous Artificial Intelligence (AI) to achieve data-driven Machine Learning (ML) solutions in heterogeneous and massive-scale networks. However, traditional ML techniques require centralized data collection and processing by a central server, which is becoming a bottleneck of large-scale implementation in daily life due to significantly increasing privacy concerns. Federated learning, as an emerging distributed AI approach with privacy preservation nature, is particularly attractive for various wireless applications, especially being treated as one of the vital solutions to achieve ubiquitous AI in 6G.

W3176709420,Towards Open World Object Detection,"Humans have a natural instinct to identify unknown object instances in their environments. The intrinsic curiosity about these unknown instances aids in learning about them, when the corresponding knowledge is eventually available. This motivates us to propose a novel computer vision problem called: 'Open World Object Detection', where a model is tasked to: 1) identify objects that have not been introduced to it as 'unknown', without explicit supervision to do so, and 2) incrementally learn these identified unknown categories without forgetting previously learned classes, when the corresponding labels are progressively received. We formulate the problem, introduce a strong evaluation protocol and provide a novel solution, which we call ORE: Open World Object Detector, based on contrastive clustering and energy based unknown identification. Our experimental evaluation and ablation studies analyse the efficacy of ORE in achieving Open World objectives. As an interesting by-product, we find that identifying and characterising unknown instances helps to reduce confusion in an incremental object detection setting, where we achieve state-of-the-art performance, with no extra methodological effort.

It has a wide range of applications, and therefore has been attracting increasing attention in the field of computer vision. Human actions can be represented using various data modalities, such as RGB, skeleton, depth, infrared, point cloud, event stream, audio, acceleration, radar, and WiFi signal, which encode different sources of useful yet distinct information and have various advantages depending on the application scenarios. Consequently, lots of existing works have attempted to investigate different types of approaches for HAR using various modalities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of recent progress in deep learning methods for HAR based on the type of input data modality. Specifically, we review the current mainstream deep learning methods for single data modalities and multiple data modalities, including the fusion-based and the co-learning-based frameworks. We also present comparative results on several benchmark datasets for HAR, together with insightful observations and inspiring future research directions.",2022-01-01,2022,Zehua Sun; Qiuhong Ke; Hossein Rahmani; Mohammed Bennamoun; Gang Wang,Monash University,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,377,https://doi.org/10.1109/tpami.2022.3183112,AI_Machine_Learning,Modalities; Computer science; Deep learning; Artificial intelligence; Modality (human–computer interaction),0.267
W3035265375,ActBERT: Learning Global-Local Video-Text Representations,"In this paper, we introduce ActBERT for self-supervised learning of joint video-text representations from unlabeled data. First, we leverage global action information to catalyze the mutual interactions between linguistic texts and local regional objects. It uncovers global and local visual clues from paired video sequences and text descriptions for detailed visual and text relation modeling. Second, we introduce an ENtangled Transformer block (ENT) to encode three sources of information, i.e., global actions, local regional objects, and linguistic descriptions. Global-local correspondences are discovered via judicious clues extraction from contextual information. It enforces the joint video-text representation to be aware of fine-grained objects as well as global human intention. We validate the generalization capability of ActBERT on downstream video-and language tasks, i.e., text-video clip retrieval, video captioning, video question answering, action segmentation, and action step localization.

W3035633116,UC-Net: Uncertainty Inspired RGB-D Saliency Detection via Conditional Variational Autoencoders,"In this paper, we propose the first framework (UCNet) to employ uncertainty for RGB-D saliency detection by learning from the data labeling process. Existing RGB-D saliency detection methods treat the saliency detection task as a point estimation problem, and produce a single saliency map following a deterministic learning pipeline. Inspired by the saliency data labeling process, we propose probabilistic RGB-D saliency detection network via conditional variational autoencoders to model human annotation uncertainty and generate multiple saliency maps for each input image by sampling in the latent space. With the proposed saliency consensus process, we are able to generate an accurate saliency map based on these multiple predictions. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on six challenging benchmark datasets against 18 competing algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in learning the distribution of saliency maps, leading to a new state-of-the-art in RGB-D saliency detection.",2020-06-01,2020,Jing Zhang; Deng-Ping Fan; Yuchao Dai; Saeed Anwar; Fatemeh Sadat Saleh,Australian National University,2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),371,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr42600.2020.00861,AI_Machine_Learning,Artificial intelligence; RGB color model; Benchmark (surveying); Computer science; Kadir–Brady saliency detector,0.208

W2952298682,Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cyber Security,"The scale of Internet-connected systems has increased considerably, and these systems are being exposed to cyberattacks more than ever. The complexity and dynamics of cyberattacks require protecting mechanisms to be responsive, adaptive, and scalable. Machine learning, or more specifically deep reinforcement learning (DRL), methods have been proposed widely to address these issues. By incorporating deep learning into traditional RL, DRL is highly capable of solving complex, dynamic, and especially high-dimensional cyber defense problems. This article presents a survey of DRL approaches developed for cyber security. We touch on different vital aspects, including DRL-based security methods for cyber-physical systems, autonomous intrusion detection techniques, and multiagent DRL-based game theory simulations for defense strategies against cyberattacks. Extensive discussions and future research directions on DRL-based cyber security are also given.

W3035484352,Deblurring by Realistic Blurring,"Existing deep learning methods for image deblurring typically train models using pairs of sharp images and their blurred counterparts. However, synthetically blurring images does not necessarily model the blurring process in real-world scenarios with sufficient accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a new method which combines two GAN models, i.e., a learning-to-Blur GAN (BGAN) and learning-to-DeBlur GAN (DBGAN), in order to learn a better model for image deblurring by primarily learning how to blur images. The first model, BGAN, learns how to blur sharp images with unpaired sharp and blurry image sets, and then guides the second model, DBGAN, to learn how to correctly deblur such images. In order to reduce the discrepancy between real blur and synthesized blur, a relativistic blur loss is leveraged. As an additional contribution, this paper also introduces a Real-World Blurred Image (RWBI) dataset including diverse blurry images. Our experiments show that the proposed method achieves consistently superior quantitative performance as well as higher perceptual quality on both the newly proposed dataset and the public GOPRO dataset.",2020-06-01,2020,Kaihao Zhang; Wenhan Luo; Yiran Zhong; Lin Ma; Björn Stenger,Australian National University,2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),361,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr42600.2020.00281,AI_Machine_Learning,Deblurring; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computer vision; Image (mathematics),0.342

Fortunately, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a solution to this challenge by connecting physical objects using electronics, sensors, software, and communication networks. This has transformed smart city infrastructures, introducing various technologies that enhance sustainability, productivity, and comfort for urban dwellers.

W4386071547,MaPLe: Multi-modal Prompt Learning,"Pre-trained vision-language (V-L) models such as CLIP have shown excellent generalization ability to downstream tasks. However, they are sensitive to the choice of input text prompts and require careful selection of prompt templates to perform well. Inspired by the Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature, recent CLIP adaptation approaches learn prompts as the textual inputs to fine-tune CLIP for downstream tasks. We note that using prompting to adapt representations in a single branch of CLIP (language or vision) is sub-optimal since it does not allow the flexibility to dynamically adjust both representation spaces on a downstream task. In this work, we propose Multi-modal Prompt Learning (MaPLe) for both vision and language branches to improve alignment between the vision and language representations. Our design promotes strong coupling between the vision-language prompts to ensure mutual synergy and discourages learning independent uni-modal solutions. Further, we learn separate prompts across different early stages to progressively model the stage-wise feature relationships to allow rich context learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on three representative tasks of generalization to novel classes, new target datasets and unseen domain shifts. Compared with the state-of-the-art method Co-CoOp, MaPLe exhibits favorable performance and achieves an absolute gain of 3.45% on novel classes and 2.72% on overall harmonic-mean, averaged over 11 diverse image recognition datasets.

W3160749997,The combined use of symmetric and asymmetric approaches: partial least squares-structural equation modeling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis,"Purpose This study aims to propose guidelines for the joint use of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to combine symmetric and asymmetric perspectives in model evaluation, in the hospitality and tourism field. Design/methodology/approach This study discusses PLS-SEM as a symmetric approach and fsQCA as an asymmetric approach to analyze structural and configurational models. It presents guidelines to conduct an fsQCA based on latent construct scores drawn from PLS-SEM, to assess how configurations of exogenous constructs produce a specific outcome in an endogenous construct. Findings This research highlights the advantages of combining PLS-SEM and fsQCA to analyze the causal effects of antecedents (i.e., exogenous constructs) on outcomes (i.e., endogenous constructs). The construct scores extracted from the PLS-SEM analysis of a nomological network of constructs provide accurate input for performing fsQCA to identify the sufficient configurations required to predict the outcome(s). Complementing the assessment of the model’s explanatory and predictive power, the fsQCA generates more fine-grained insights into variable relationships, thereby offering the means to reach better managerial conclusions. Originality/value The application of PLS-SEM and fsQCA as separate prediction-oriented methods has increased notably in recent years. However, in the absence of clear guidelines, studies applied the methods inconsistently, giving researchers little direction on how to best apply PLS-SEM and fsQCA in tandem. To address this concern, this study provides guidelines for the joint use of PLS-SEM and fsQCA.",2021-05-17,2021,S. Mostafa Rasoolimanesh; Christian M.

W3096831017,Deep learning-enabled triboelectric smart socks for IoT-based gait analysis and VR applications,"Abstract The era of artificial intelligence and internet of things is rapidly developed by recent advances in wearable electronics. Gait reveals sensory information in daily life containing personal information, regarding identification and healthcare. Current wearable electronics of gait analysis are mainly limited by high fabrication cost, operation energy consumption, or inferior analysis methods, which barely involve machine learning or implement nonoptimal models that require massive datasets for training. Herein, we developed low-cost triboelectric intelligent socks for harvesting waste energy from low-frequency body motions to transmit wireless sensory data. The sock equipped with self-powered functionality also can be used as wearable sensors to deliver information, regarding the identity, health status, and activity of the users. To further address the issue of ineffective analysis methods, an optimized deep learning model with an end-to-end structure on the socks signals for the gait analysis is proposed, which produces a 93.54% identification accuracy of 13 participants and detects five different human activities with 96.67% accuracy. Toward practical application, we map the physical signals collected through the socks in the virtual space to establish a digital human system for sports monitoring, healthcare, identification, and future smart home applications.",2020-10-26,2020,Zixuan Zhang; Tianyiyi He; Minglu Zhu; Zhongda Sun; Qiongfeng Shi,Monash University,npj Flexible Electronics,351,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41528-020-00092-7,AI_Machine_Learning,SOCKS; Wearable computer; Computer science; Identification (biology); Wearable technology,0.925
W4221040597,Digital technologies: tensions in privacy and data,"Driven by data proliferation, digital technologies have transformed the marketing landscape. In parallel, significant privacy concerns have shaken consumer-firm relationships, prompting changes in both regulatory interventions and people's own privacy-protective behaviors. With a comprehensive analysis of digital technologies and data strategy informed by structuration theory and privacy literature, the authors consider privacy tensions as the product of firm-consumer interactions, facilitated by digital technologies. This perspective in turn implies distinct consumer, regulatory, and firm responses related to data protection. By consolidating various perspectives, the authors propose three tenets and seven propositions, supported by interview insights from senior managers and consumer informants, that create a foundation for understanding the digital technology implications for firm performance in contexts marked by growing privacy worries and legal ramifications. On the basis of this conceptual framework, they also propose a data strategy typology across two main strategic functions of digital technologies: data monetization and data sharing. The result is four distinct types of firms, which engage in disparate behaviors in the broader ecosystem pertaining to privacy issues.

W3176152216,"Simultaneously Localize, Segment and Rank the Camouflaged Objects","Camouflage is a key defence mechanism across species that is critical to survival. Common strategies for camouflage include background matching, imitating the color and pattern of the environment, and disruptive coloration, disguising body outlines [37]. Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment camouflaged objects hiding in their surroundings. Existing COD models are built upon binary ground truth to segment the camouflaged objects without illustrating the level of camouflage. In this paper, we revisit this task and argue that explicitly modeling the conspicuousness of camouflaged objects against their particular backgrounds can not only lead to a better understanding about camouflage and evolution of animals, but also provide guidance to design more sophisticated camouflage techniques. Furthermore, we observe that it is some specific parts of the camouflaged objects that make them detectable by predators. With the above understanding about camouflaged objects, we present the first ranking based COD network (Rank-Net) to simultaneously localize, segment and rank camouflaged objects. The localization model is proposed to find the discriminative regions that make the camouflaged object obvious. The segmentation model segments the full scope of the camouflaged objects. Further, the ranking model infers the detectability of different camouflaged objects. Moreover, we contribute a large COD testing set to evaluate the generalization ability of COD models. Experimental results show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art, leading to a more interpretable COD network <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">1</sup> .",2021-06-01,2021,Yunqiu Lv; Jing Zhang; Yuchao Dai; Aixuan Li; Bowen Liu,Australian National University,2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),340,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr46437.2021.01142,AI_Machine_Learning,Camouflage; Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Generalization; Object (grammar),0.567

In clinical data analytics, it is a great challenge to predict heart disease survivor. Data mining transforms huge amounts of raw data generated by the health industry into useful information that can help in making informed decisions. Various studies proved that significant features play a key role in improving performance of machine learning models. This study analyzes the heart failure survivors from the dataset of 299 patients admitted in hospital. The aim is to find significant features and effective data mining techniques that can boost the accuracy of cardiovascular patient's survivor prediction. To predict patient's survival, this study employs nine classification models: Decision Tree (DT), Adaptive boosting classifier (AdaBoost), Logistic Regression (LR), Stochastic Gradient classifier (SGD), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting classifier (GBM), Extra Tree Classifier (ETC), Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier (G-NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The imbalance class problem is handled by Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Furthermore, machine learning models are trained on the highest ranked features selected by RF. The results are compared with those provided by machine learning algorithms using full set of features.

W3165430704,Epileptic Seizures Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques: A Review,"A variety of screening approaches have been proposed to diagnose epileptic seizures, using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities. Artificial intelligence encompasses a variety of areas, and one of its branches is deep learning (DL). Before the rise of DL, conventional machine learning algorithms involving feature extraction were performed. This limited their performance to the ability of those handcrafting the features. However, in DL, the extraction of features and classification are entirely automated. The advent of these techniques in many areas of medicine, such as in the diagnosis of epileptic seizures, has made significant advances. In this study, a comprehensive overview of works focused on automated epileptic seizure detection using DL techniques and neuroimaging modalities is presented. Various methods proposed to diagnose epileptic seizures automatically using EEG and MRI modalities are described. In addition, rehabilitation systems developed for epileptic seizures using DL have been analyzed, and a summary is provided. The rehabilitation tools include cloud computing techniques and hardware required for implementation of DL algorithms. The important challenges in accurate detection of automated epileptic seizures using DL with EEG and MRI modalities are discussed.

For each group of classified applications, we outline its suitable IoT connectivity options.",2020-01-01,2020,Jie Ding; Hossein Mashad Nemati; Chathurika Ranaweera; Jinho Choi,Deakin University,IEEE Access,325,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.2985932,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Internet of Things; Wireless; Key (lock); Random access,0.267
W3001364574,A Novel PCA-Firefly Based XGBoost Classification Model for Intrusion Detection in Networks Using GPU,"The enormous popularity of the internet across all spheres of human life has introduced various risks of malicious attacks in the network. The activities performed over the network could be effortlessly proliferated, which has led to the emergence of intrusion detection systems. The patterns of the attacks are also dynamic, which necessitates efficient classification and prediction of cyber attacks. In this paper we propose a hybrid principal component analysis (PCA)-firefly based machine learning model to classify intrusion detection system (IDS) datasets. The dataset used in the study is collected from Kaggle. The model first performs One-Hot encoding for the transformation of the IDS datasets. The hybrid PCA-firefly algorithm is then used for dimensionality reduction. The XGBoost algorithm is implemented on the reduced dataset for classification. A comprehensive evaluation of the model is conducted with the state of the art machine learning approaches to justify the superiority of our proposed approach. The experimental results confirm the fact that the proposed model performs better than the existing machine learning models.",2020-01-27,2020,Sweta Bhattacharya; Siva Rama Krishnan S; Praveen Kumar Reddy Maddikunta; Rajesh Kaluri; Saurabh Singh,Charles Darwin University,Electronics,322,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics9020219,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Intrusion detection system; Principal component analysis; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning,0.775
W3196174740,"Grid Forming Inverter Modeling, Control, and Applications","This paper surveys current literature on modeling methods, control techniques, protection schemes, applications, and real-world implementations pertaining to grid forming inverters (GFMIs). Electric power systems are increasingly being augmented with inverter-based resources (IBRs). While having a growing share of IBRs, conventional synchronous generator-based voltage and frequency control mechanisms are still prevalent in the power industry. Therefore, IBRs are experiencing a growing demand for mimicking the behavior of synchronous generators, which is not possible with conventional grid following inverters (GFLIs). As a solution, the concept of GFMIs is currently emerging, which is drawing increased attention from academia and the industry. This paper presents a comprehensive review of GFMIs covering recent advancements in control technologies, fault ride-through capabilities, stability enhancement measures, and practical implementations. Moreover, the challenges in adding GFMIs into existing power systems, including a seamless transition from grid-connected mode to the standalone mode and vice versa, are also discussed in detail. Recently commissioned projects in Australia, the UK, and the US are taken as examples to highlight the trend in the power industry in adding GFMIs to address issues related to weak grid scenarios. Research directions in terms of voltage control, frequency control, system strength improvement, and regulatory framework are also discussed. This paper serves as a resource for researchers and power system engineers exploring solutions to the emerging problems with high penetration of IBRs, focusing on GFMIs.",2021-01-01,2021,Dayan B.

W4283705032,Automatic Generation of Programming Exercises and Code Explanations Using Large Language Models,"This article explores the natural language generation capabilities of large language models with application to the production of two types of learning resources common in programming courses. Using OpenAI Codex as the large language model, we create programming exercises (including sample solutions and test cases) and code explanations, assessing these qualitatively and quantitatively. Our results suggest that the majority of the automatically generated content is both novel and sensible, and in some cases ready to use as is. When creating exercises we find that it is remarkably easy to influence both the programming concepts and the contextual themes they contain, simply by supplying keywords as input to the model. Our analysis suggests that there is significant value in massive generative machine learning models as a tool for instructors, although there remains a need for some oversight to ensure the quality of the generated content before it is delivered to students. We further discuss the implications of OpenAI Codex and similar tools for introductory programming education and highlight future research streams that have the potential to improve the quality of the educational experience for both teachers and students alike.",2022-08-03,2022,Sami Sarsa; Paul Denny; Arto Hellas; Juho Leinonen,University of Auckland,,322,https://doi.org/10.1145/3501385.3543957,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Generative grammar; Code (set theory); Quality (philosophy); Sample (material),0.475
W3135347465,When Machine Learning Meets Privacy,"The newly emerged machine learning (e.g., deep learning) methods have become a strong driving force to revolutionize a wide range of industries, such as smart healthcare, financial technology, and surveillance systems. Meanwhile, privacy has emerged as a big concern in this machine learning-based artificial intelligence era. It is important to note that the problem of privacy preservation in the context of machine learning is quite different from that in traditional data privacy protection, as machine learning can act as both friend and foe. Currently, the work on the preservation of privacy and machine learning are still in an infancy stage, as most existing solutions only focus on privacy problems during the machine learning process. Therefore, a comprehensive study on the privacy preservation problems and machine learning is required. This article surveys the state of the art in privacy issues and solutions for machine learning. The survey covers three categories of interactions between privacy and machine learning: (i) private machine learning, (ii) machine learning-aided privacy protection, and (iii) machine learning-based privacy attack and corresponding protection schemes. The current research progress in each category is reviewed and the key challenges are identified. Finally, based on our in-depth analysis of the area of privacy and machine learning, we point out future research directions in this field.",2021-03-05,2021,Bo Liu; Ming Ding; Sina Shaham; Wenny Rahayu; Farhad Farokhi,University of Technology Sydney,ACM Computing Surveys,319,https://doi.org/10.1145/3436755,AI_Machine_Learning,Machine learning; Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Context (archaeology); Information privacy,0.625

W3087277009,Automated pavement crack detection and segmentation based on two‐step convolutional neural network,"Abstract Cracking is a common pavement distress that would cause further severe problems if not repaired timely, which means that it is important to accurately extract the information of pavement cracks through detection and segmentation. Automated pavement crack detection and segmentation using deep learning are more efficient and accurate than conventional methods, which could be further improved. While many existing studies have utilized deep learning in pavement crack segmentation, which segments cracks from non‐crack regions, few studies have taken the exact pavement crack detection into account, which identifies cracks in the images from other objects. A two‐step pavement crack detection and segmentation method based on convolutional neural network was proposed in this paper. An automated pavement crack detection algorithm was developed using the modified You Only Look Once 3rd version in the first step. The proposed crack segmentation method in the second step was based on the modified U‐Net, whose encoder was replaced with a pre‐trained ResNet‐34 and the up‐sample part was added with spatial and channel squeeze and excitation (SCSE) modules. Proposed method combines pavement crack detection and segmentation together, so that the detected cracks from the first step are segmented in the second step to improve the accuracy. A dataset of pavement crack images in different circumstances were also built for the study. The F1 score of proposed crack detection and segmentation methods are 90.58% and 95.75%, respectively, which are higher than other state‐of‐the‐art methods. Compared with existing one‐step pavement crack detection or segmentation methods, proposed two‐step method showed advantages of accuracy.",2020-09-17,2020,Jingwei Liu; Xu Yang; Stephen Lau; Xin Wang; Sang Luo,Monash University,Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering,317,https://doi.org/10.1111/mice.12622,AI_Machine_Learning,Segmentation; Convolutional neural network; Computer science; Artificial neural network; Artificial intelligence,0.475
W3194841521,A Survey of Community Detection Approaches: From Statistical Modeling to Deep Learning,"Community detection, a fundamental task for network analysis, aims to partition a network into multiple sub-structures to help reveal their latent functions. Community detection has been extensively studied in and broadly applied to many real-world network problems. Classical approaches to community detection typically utilize probabilistic graphical models and adopt a variety of prior knowledge to infer community structures. As the problems that network methods try to solve and the network data to be analyzed become increasingly more sophisticated, new approaches have also been proposed and developed, particularly those that utilize deep learning and convert networked data into low dimensional representation. Despite all the recent advancement, there is still a lack of insightful understanding of the theoretical and methodological underpinning of community detection, which will be critically important for future development of the area of network analysis. In this paper, we develop and present a unified architecture of network community-finding methods to characterize the state-of-the-art of the field of community detection. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing community detection methods and introduce a new taxonomy that divides the existing methods into two categories, namely probabilistic graphical model and deep learning. We then discuss in detail the main idea behind each method in the two categories. Furthermore, to promote future development of community detection, we release several benchmark datasets from several problem domains and highlight their applications to various network analysis tasks. We conclude with discussions of the challenges of the field and suggestions of possible directions for future research.",2021-01-01,2021,Di Jin; Zhizhi Yu; Pengfei Jiao; Shirui Pan; Dongxiao He,Monash University,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,317,https://doi.org/10.1109/tkde.2021.3104155,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Graphical model; Data science; Field (mathematics); Benchmark (surveying),0.433
W4240644295,The ARRIVE guidelines 2.0: Updated guidelines for reporting animal research,"Abstract Reproducible science requires transparent reporting. The ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) were originally developed in 2010 to improve the reporting of animal research. They consist of a checklist of information to include in publications describing in vivo experiments to enable others to scrutinise the work adequately, evaluate its methodological rigour, and reproduce the methods and results. Despite considerable levels of endorsement by funders and journals over the years, adherence to the guidelines has been inconsistent, and the anticipated improvements in the quality of reporting in animal research publications have not been achieved. Here, we introduce ARRIVE 2.0. The guidelines have been updated and information reorganised to facilitate their use in practice. We used a Delphi exercise to prioritise and divide the items of the guidelines into 2 sets, the “ARRIVE Essential 10,” which constitutes the minimum requirement, and the “Recommended Set,” which describes the research context. This division facilitates improved reporting of animal research by supporting a stepwise approach to implementation. This helps journal editors and reviewers verify that the most important items are being reported in manuscripts. We have also developed the accompanying Explanation and Elaboration document, which serves (1) to explain the rationale behind each item in the guidelines, (2) to clarify key concepts, and (3) to provide illustrative examples. We aim, through these changes, to help ensure that researchers, reviewers, and journal editors are better equipped to improve the rigour and transparency of the scientific process and thus reproducibility.",2020-07-14,2020,Nathalie Percie du Sert; Viki Hurst; Amrita Ahluwalia; Sabina Alam; Marc T.

W4211263275,The Robots Are Coming: Exploring the Implications of OpenAI Codex on Introductory Programming,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence have been driven by an exponential growth in digitised data. Natural language processing, in particular, has been transformed by machine learning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-3 which generates human-like text so realistic that its developers have warned of the dangers of its misuse. In recent months OpenAI released Codex, a new deep learning model trained on Python code from more than 50 million GitHub repositories. Provided with a natural language description of a programming problem as input, Codex generates solution code as output. It can also explain (in English) input code, translate code between programming languages, and more. In this work, we explore how Codex performs on typical introductory programming problems. We report its performance on real questions taken from introductory programming exams and compare it to results from students who took these same exams under normal conditions, demonstrating that Codex outscores most students. We then explore how Codex handles subtle variations in problem wording using several published variants of the well-known “Rainfall Problem” along with one unpublished variant we have used in our teaching. We find the model passes many test cases for all variants. We also explore how much variation there is in the Codex generated solutions, observing that an identical input prompt frequently leads to very different solutions in terms of algorithmic approach and code length. Finally, we discuss the implications that such technology will have for computing education as it continues to evolve, including both challenges and opportunities.",2022-02-09,2022,James Finnie-Ansley; Paul Denny; Brett A.

W3099183222,Attention-based VGG-16 model for COVID-19 chest X-ray image classification,"Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods such as Chest X-rays (CXR)-based method is one of the cheapest alternative options to diagnose the early stage of COVID-19 disease compared to other alternatives such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, and so on. To this end, there have been few works proposed to diagnose COVID-19 by using CXR-based methods. However, they have limited performance as they ignore the spatial relationships between the region of interests (ROIs) in CXR images, which could identify the likely regions of COVID-19's effect in the human lungs. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based deep learning model using the attention module with VGG-16. By using the attention module, we capture the spatial relationship between the ROIs in CXR images. In the meantime, by using an appropriate convolution layer (4th pooling layer) of the VGG-16 model in addition to the attention module, we design a novel deep learning model to perform fine-tuning in the classification process. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conduct extensive experiments by using three COVID-19 CXR image datasets. The experiment and analysis demonstrate the stable and promising performance of our proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The promising classification performance of our proposed method indicates that it is suitable for CXR image classification in COVID-19 diagnosis.",2020-11-17,2020,Chiranjibi Sitaula; Mohammad Belayet Hossain,Deakin University,Applied Intelligence,311,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-020-02055-x,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Pooling; CAD,0.625
W3139429868,Revisiting Milgram and Kishino's Reality-Virtuality Continuum,"Since its introduction in 1994, Milgram and Kishino's reality-virtuality (RV) continuum has been used to frame virtual and augmented reality research and development. While originally, the RV continuum and the three dimensions of the supporting taxonomy (extent of world knowledge, reproduction fidelity, and extent of presence metaphor) were intended to characterize the capabilities of visual display technology, researchers have embraced the RV continuum while largely ignoring the taxonomy. Considering the leaps in technology made over the last 25 years, revisiting the RV continuum and taxonomy is timely. In reexamining Milgram and Kishino's ideas, we realized, first, that the RV continuum is actually discontinuous; perfect virtual reality cannot be reached. Secondly, mixed reality is broader than previously believed, and, in fact, encompasses conventional virtual reality experiences. Finally, our revised taxonomy adds coherence, accounting for the role of users, which is critical to assessing modern mixed reality experiences. The 3D space created by our taxonomy incorporates familiar constructs such as presence and immersion, and also proposes new constructs that may be important as mixed reality technology matures.",2021-03-24,2021,Richard Skarbez; Missie Smith; Mary C.

It might be the worst of times, but it might be the best of times because of opportunities brought by machine learning (ML), in particular deep learning (DL). In general, DL delivers superior performance to ML because of its layered setting and its effective algorithm for extract useful information from training data. DL models are adopted quickly to cyber attacks against CPS systems. In this survey, a holistic view of recently proposed DL solutions is provided to cyber attack detection in the CPS context. A six-step DL driven methodology is provided to summarize and analyze the surveyed literature for applying DL methods to detect cyber attacks against CPS systems. The methodology includes CPS scenario analysis, cyber attack identification, ML problem formulation, DL model customization, data acquisition for training, and performance evaluation. The reviewed works indicate great potential to detect cyber attacks against CPS through DL modules. Moreover, excellent performance is achieved partly because of several high-quality datasets that are readily available for public use.

W3005147719,Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy Using PCA-Firefly Based Deep Learning Model,"Diabetic Retinopathy is a major cause of vision loss and blindness affecting millions of people across the globe. Although there are established screening methods - fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography for detection of the disease but in majority of the cases, the patients remain ignorant and fail to undertake such tests at an appropriate time. The early detection of the disease plays an extremely important role in preventing vision loss which is the consequence of diabetes mellitus remaining untreated among patients for a prolonged time period. Various machine learning and deep learning approaches have been implemented on diabetic retinopathy dataset for classification and prediction of the disease but majority of them have neglected the aspect of data pre-processing and dimensionality reduction, leading to biased results. The dataset used in the present study is a diabetes retinopathy dataset collected from the UCI machine learning repository. At its inceptions, the raw dataset is normalized using the Standardscalar technique and then Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to extract the most significant features in the dataset. Further, Firefly algorithm is implemented for dimensionality reduction. This reduced dataset is fed into a Deep Neural Network Model for classification. The results generated from the model is evaluated against the prevalent machine learning models and the results justify the superiority of the proposed model in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Sensitivity and Specificity.",2020-02-05,2020,Thippa Reddy Gadekallu; Neelu Khare; Sweta Bhattacharya; Saurabh Singh; Praveen Kumar Reddy Maddikunta,Charles Darwin University,Electronics,305,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics9020274,AI_Machine_Learning,Artificial intelligence; Diabetic retinopathy; Machine learning; Deep learning; Dimensionality reduction,0.55
W4283796083,FedProto: Federated Prototype Learning across Heterogeneous Clients,"Heterogeneity across clients in federated learning (FL) usually hinders the optimization convergence and generalization performance when the aggregation of clients' knowledge occurs in the gradient space. For example, clients may differ in terms of data distribution, network latency, input/output space, and/or model architecture, which can easily lead to the misalignment of their local gradients. To improve the tolerance to heterogeneity, we propose a novel federated prototype learning (FedProto) framework in which the clients and server communicate the abstract class prototypes instead of the gradients. FedProto aggregates the local prototypes collected from different clients, and then sends the global prototypes back to all clients to regularize the training of local models. The training on each client aims to minimize the classification error on the local data while keeping the resulting local prototypes sufficiently close to the corresponding global ones. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis to the convergence rate of FedProto under non-convex objectives. In experiments, we propose a benchmark setting tailored for heterogeneous FL, with FedProto outperforming several recent FL approaches on multiple datasets.",2022-06-28,2022,Yue Tan; Guodong Long; Lu Liu; Tianyi Zhou; Qinghua Lu,University of Technology Sydney,Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,305,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i8.20819,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Federated learning; Benchmark (surveying); Latency (audio); Convergence (economics),0.625

The present study addresses this knowledge gap by developing a strategic roadmap that explains how businesses can leverage Industry 4.0 technologies to introduce sustainability into innovative practices. For this purpose, the study conducts a systematic review of extant literature to identify Industry 4.0 functions for sustainable innovation and applies interpretive structural modeling to devise the promised roadmap.

W3127796055,Prelithiation: A Crucial Strategy for Boosting the Practical Application of Next-Generation Lithium Ion Battery,"With the urgent market demand for high-energy-density batteries, the alloy-type or conversion-type anodes with high specific capacity have gained increasing attention to replace current low-specific-capacity graphite-based anodes. However, alloy-type and conversion-type anodes have large initial irreversible capacity compared with graphite-based anodes, which consume most of the Li+ in the corresponding cathode and severely reduces the energy density of full cells. Therefore, for the practical application of these high-capacity anodes, it is urgent to develop a commercially available prelithiation technique to compensate for their large initial irreversible capacity. At present, various prelithiation methods for compensating the initial irreversible capacity of the anode have been reported, but due to their respective shortcomings, large-scale commercial applications have not yet been achieved. In this review, we have systematically summarized and analyzed the advantages and challenges of various prelithiation methods, providing enlightenment for the further development of each prelithiation strategy toward commercialization and thus facilitating the practical application of high-specific-capacity anodes in the next-generation high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries.",2021-02-11,2021,Fei Wang; Bo Wang; Jingxuan Li; Bin Wang; Yu Zhou,University of Wollongong,ACS Nano,299,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c10664,AI_Machine_Learning,Anode; Materials science; Commercialization; Battery (electricity); Process engineering,0.567
W3011838269,Sex Differences in Mate Preferences Across 45 Countries: A Large-Scale Replication,"Considerable research has examined human mate preferences across cultures, finding universal sex differences in preferences for attractiveness and resources as well as sources of systematic cultural variation. Two competing perspectives-an evolutionary psychological perspective and a biosocial role perspective-offer alternative explanations for these findings. However, the original data on which each perspective relies are decades old, and the literature is fraught with conflicting methods, analyses, results, and conclusions. Using a new 45-country sample (N = 14,399), we attempted to replicate classic studies and test both the evolutionary and biosocial role perspectives. Support for universal sex differences in preferences remains robust: Men, more than women, prefer attractive, young mates, and women, more than men, prefer older mates with financial prospects. Cross-culturally, both sexes have mates closer to their own ages as gender equality increases. Beyond age of partner, neither pathogen prevalence nor gender equality robustly predicted sex differences or preferences across countries.",2020-03-20,2020,Kathryn V.

In the first level of the framework, the similarity measures of DNS queries are estimated using siamese networks based on a predefined threshold for selecting the most frequent DNS information across Ethernet connections. In the second level of the framework, a domain generation algorithm based on deep learning architectures is suggested for categorizing normal and abnormal domain names. The framework is highly scalable on a commodity hardware server due to its potential design of analyzing DNS data. The proposed framework was evaluated using two datasets and was compared with recent deep learning models. Various visualization methods were also employed to understand the characteristics of the dataset and to visualize the embedding features. The experimental results revealed substantial improvements in terms of F1-score, speed of detection, and false alarm rate.",2020-02-06,2020,R.

W3011845528,"Photonic Perceptron Based on a Kerr Microcomb for High‐Speed, Scalable, Optical Neural Networks","Abstract Optical artificial neural networks (ONNs)—analog computing hardware tailored for machine learning—have significant potential for achieving ultra‐high computing speed and energy efficiency. A new approach to architectures for ONNs based on integrated Kerr microcomb sources that is programmable, highly scalable, and capable of reaching ultra‐high speeds is proposed here. The building block of the ONN—a single neuron perceptron—is experimentally demonstrated that reaches a high single‐unit throughput speed of 11.9 Giga‐FLOPS at 8 bits per FLOP, corresponding to 95.2 Gbps, achieved by mapping synapses onto 49 wavelengths of a microcomb. The perceptron is tested on simple standard benchmark datasets—handwritten‐digit recognition and cancer‐cell detection—achieving over 90% and 85% accuracy, respectively. This performance is a direct result of the record low wavelength spacing (49 GHz) for a coherent integrated microcomb source, which results in an unprecedented number of wavelengths for neuromorphic optics. Finally, an approach to scaling the perceptron to a deep learning network is proposed using the same single microcomb device and standard off‐the‐shelf telecommunications technology, for high‐throughput operation involving full matrix multiplication for applications such as real‐time massive data processing for unmanned vehicles and aircraft tracking.",2020-08-06,2020,Xingyuan Xu; Mengxi Tan; Bill Corcoran; Jiayang Wu; Thach G.

W3129603732,"FedBN: Federated Learning on Non-IID Features via Local Batch
  Normalization","The emerging paradigm of federated learning (FL) strives to enable collaborative training of deep models on the network edge without centrally aggregating raw data and hence improving data privacy. In most cases, the assumption of independent and identically distributed samples across local clients does not hold for federated learning setups. Under this setting, neural network training performance may vary significantly according to the data distribution and even hurt training convergence. Most of the previous work has focused on a difference in the distribution of labels or client shifts. Unlike those settings, we address an important problem of FL, e.g., different scanners/sensors in medical imaging, different scenery distribution in autonomous driving (highway vs. city), where local clients store examples with different distributions compared to other clients, which we denote as feature shift non-iid. In this work, we propose an effective method that uses local batch normalization to alleviate the feature shift before averaging models. The resulting scheme, called FedBN, outperforms both classical FedAvg, as well as the state-of-the-art for non-iid data (FedProx) on our extensive experiments. These empirical results are supported by a convergence analysis that shows in a simplified setting that FedBN has a faster convergence rate than FedAvg.

W3042070225,A Blockchained Federated Learning Framework for Cognitive Computing in Industry 4.0 Networks,"Cognitive computing, a revolutionary AI concept emulating human brain's reasoning process, is progressively flourishing in the Industry 4.0 automation. With the advancement of various AI and machine learning technologies the evolution toward improved decision making as well as data-driven intelligent manufacturing has already been evident. However, several emerging issues, including the poisoning attacks, performance, and inadequate data resources, etc., have to be resolved. Recent research works studied the problem lightly, which often leads to unreliable performance, inefficiency, and privacy leakage. In this article, we developed a decentralized paradigm for big data-driven cognitive computing (D2C), using federated learning and blockchain jointly. Federated learning can solve the problem of “data island” with privacy protection and efficient processing while blockchain provides incentive mechanism, fully decentralized fashion, and robust against poisoning attacks. Using blockchain-enabled federated learning help quick convergence with advanced verifications and member selections. Extensive evaluation and assessment findings demonstrate D2C's effectiveness relative to existing leading designs and models.",2020-07-07,2020,Youyang Qu; Shiva Raj Pokhrel; Sahil Garg; Longxiang Gao; Yong Xiang,Deakin University,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,290,https://doi.org/10.1109/tii.2020.3007817,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Blockchain; Big data; Incentive; Artificial intelligence,0.567
W4312617404,Image Dehazing Transformer with Transmission-Aware 3D Position Embedding,"Despite single image dehazing has been made promising progress with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the inherent equivariance and locality of convolution still bottleneck deharing performance. Though Transformer has occupied various computer vision tasks, directly leveraging Transformer for image dehazing is challenging: 1) it tends to result in ambiguous and coarse details that are undesired for image reconstruction; 2) previous position embedding of Transformer is provided in logic or spatial position order that neglects the variational haze densities, which results in the sub-optimal dehazlng performance. The key insight of this study is to investigate how to combine CNN and Transformer for image dehazing. To solve the feature inconsistency issue between Transformer and CNN, we propose to modulate CNN features via learning modulation matrices (i.e., coefficient matrix and bias matrix) conditioned on Transformer features instead of simple feature addition or concatenation. The feature modulation naturally inherits the global context modeling capability of Transformer and the local representation capability of CNN. We bring a haze density-related prior into Trans-former via a novel transmission-aware 3D position embedding module, which not only provides the relative position but also suggests the haze density of different spatial regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, DeHamer, attains state-of-the-art performance on several image dehazing benchmarks.",2022-06-01,2022,Chunle Guo; Qixin Yan; Saeed Anwar; Runmin Cong; Wenqi Ren,Australian National University,2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),288,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr52688.2022.00572,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Embedding; Transformer; Artificial intelligence; Convolutional neural network,0.625
W4313646859,"Remote patient monitoring using artificial intelligence: Current state, applications, and challenges","Abstract The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is growing rapidly. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is one of the common healthcare applications that assist doctors to monitor patients with chronic or acute illness at remote locations, elderly people in‐home care, and even hospitalized patients. The reliability of manual patient monitoring systems depends on staff time management which is dependent on their workload. Conventional patient monitoring involves invasive approaches which require skin contact to monitor health status. This study aims to do a comprehensive review of RPM systems including adopted advanced technologies, AI impact on RPM, challenges and trends in AI‐enabled RPM. This review explores the benefits and challenges of patient‐centric RPM architectures enabled with Internet of Things wearable devices and sensors using the cloud, fog, edge, and blockchain technologies. The role of AI in RPM ranges from physical activity classification to chronic disease monitoring and vital signs monitoring in emergency settings. This review results show that AI‐enabled RPM architectures have transformed healthcare monitoring applications because of their ability to detect early deterioration in patients' health, personalize individual patient health parameter monitoring using federated learning, and learn human behavior patterns using techniques such as reinforcement learning. This review discusses the challenges and trends to adopt AI to RPM systems and implementation issues. The future directions of AI in RPM applications are analyzed based on the challenges and trends.

W3005759659,Whale Optimization Algorithm With Applications to Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks,"Resource allocation plays a pivotal role in improving the performance of wireless and communication networks.However, the optimization of resource allocation is typically formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, which is non-convex and NP-hard by nature.Usually, solving such a problem is challenging and requires specific methods due to the major shortcomings of the traditional approaches, such as exponential computation complexity of global optimization, no performance optimality guarantee of heuristic schemes, and large training time and generating a standard dataset of machine learning based approaches.Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) has recently gained the attention of the research community as an efficient method to solve a variety of optimization problems.As an alternative to the existing methods, our main goal in this article is to study the applicability of WOA to solve resource allocation problems in wireless networks.First, we present the fundamental backgrounds and the binary version of the WOA as well as introducing a penalty method to handle optimization constraints.Then, we demonstrate three examples of WOA to resource allocation in wireless networks, including power allocation for energy-and-spectral efficiency tradeoff in wireless interference networks, power allocation for secure throughput maximization, and mobile edge computation offloading.Lastly, we present the adoption of WOA to solve a variety of potential resource allocation problems in 5G wireless networks and beyond.",2020-02-11,2020,Quoc‐Viet Pham; Seyedali Mirjalili; Neeraj Kumar; Mamoun Alazab; Won–Joo Hwang,Charles Darwin University,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,286,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2020.2973294,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Resource allocation; Mathematical optimization; Optimization problem; Wireless network,0.492
W3164024107,Intriguing Properties of Vision Transformers,"Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across various machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head self-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image patches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such flexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can facilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain shifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We systematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments encompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing convolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following intriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe occlusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content. (b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local textures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to CNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate shape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system, previously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape representation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic segmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a single ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high accuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional and few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to flexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention mechanism.",2021-01-01,2021,Muzammal Naseer; Kanchana Ranasinghe; Salman Khan; Munawar Hayat; Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Australian National University,arXiv (Cornell University),286,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2105.10497,AI_Machine_Learning,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; ENCODE; Transformer; Segmentation,0.7
W3173736705,Patch-NetVLAD: Multi-Scale Fusion of Locally-Global Descriptors for Place Recognition,"Visual Place Recognition is a challenging task for robotics and autonomous systems, which must deal with the twin problems of appearance and viewpoint change in an always changing world. This paper introduces Patch-NetVLAD, which provides a novel formulation for combining the advantages of both local and global descriptor methods by deriving patch-level features from NetVLAD residuals. Unlike the fixed spatial neighborhood regime of existing local keypoint features, our method enables aggregation and matching of deep-learned local features defined over the feature-space grid. We further introduce a multi-scale fusion of patch features that have complementary scales (i.e. patch sizes) via an integral feature space and show that the fused features are highly invariant to both condition (season, structure, and illumination) and viewpoint (translation and rotation) changes. Patch-NetVLAD achieves state-of-the-art visual place recognition results in computationally limited scenarios, validated on a range of challenging real-world datasets, including winning the Facebook Mapillary Visual Place Recognition Challenge at ECCV2020. It is also adaptable to user requirements, with a speed-optimised version operating over an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art. By combining superior performance with improved computational efficiency in a configurable framework, Patch-NetVLAD is well suited to enhance both stand-alone place recognition capabilities and the overall performance of SLAM systems.",2021-06-01,2021,Stephen Hausler; Sourav Garg; Ming Xu; Michael Milford; Tobias Fischer,Queensland University of Technology,2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),286,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr46437.2021.01392,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Scale (ratio); Fusion; Pattern recognition (psychology); Artificial intelligence,0.3
W4224130636,Learning Enriched Features for Fast Image Restoration and Enhancement,"Given a degraded input image, image restoration aims to recover the missing high-quality image content. Numerous applications demand effective image restoration, e.g., computational photography, surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and remote sensing. Significant advances in image restoration have been made in recent years, dominated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The widely-used CNN-based methods typically operate either on full-resolution or on progressively low-resolution representations. In the former case, spatial details are preserved but the contextual information cannot be precisely encoded. In the latter case, generated outputs are semantically reliable but spatially less accurate. This paper presents a new architecture with a holistic goal of maintaining spatially-precise high-resolution representations through the entire network, and receiving complementary contextual information from the low-resolution representations. The core of our approach is a multi-scale residual block containing the following key elements: (a) parallel multi-resolution convolution streams for extracting multi-scale features, (b) information exchange across the multi-resolution streams, (c) non-local attention mechanism for capturing contextual information, and (d) attention based multi-scale feature aggregation. Our approach learns an enriched set of features that combines contextual information from multiple scales, while simultaneously preserving the high-resolution spatial details. Extensive experiments on six real image benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method, named as MIRNet-v2, achieves state-of-the-art results for a variety of image processing tasks, including defocus deblurring, image denoising, super-resolution, and image enhancement.

W3034600477,Cost Volume Pyramid Based Depth Inference for Multi-View Stereo,"We propose a cost volume-based neural network for depth inference from multi-view images. We demonstrate that building a cost volume pyramid in a coarse-to-fine manner instead of constructing a cost volume at a fixed resolution leads to a compact, lightweight network and allows us inferring high resolution depth maps to achieve better reconstruction results. To this end, we first build a cost volume based on uniform sampling of fronto-parallel planes across the entire depth range at the coarsest resolution of an image. Then, given current depth estimate, we construct new cost volumes iteratively on the pixelwise depth residual to perform depth map refinement. While sharing similar insight with Point-MVSNet as predicting and refining depth iteratively, we show that working on cost volume pyramid can lead to a more compact, yet efficient network structure compared with the Point-MVSNet on 3D points. We further provide detailed analyses of the relation between (residual) depth sampling and image resolution, which serves as a principle for building compact cost volume pyramid. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our model can perform 6× faster and has similar performance as state-of-the-art methods.

W3138815606,Membership Inference Attacks on Machine Learning: A Survey,"Machine learning (ML) models have been widely applied to various applications, including image classification, text generation, audio recognition, and graph data analysis. However, recent studies have shown that ML models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a data record was used to train a target model or not. MIAs on ML models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For example, via identifying the fact that a clinical record that has been used to train a model associated with a certain disease, an attacker can infer that the owner of the clinical record has the disease with a high chance. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on various ML models, e.g., classification models and generative models. Meanwhile, many defense methods have been proposed to mitigate MIAs. Although MIAs on ML models form a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this article, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on membership inference attacks and defenses. We provide the taxonomies for both attacks and defenses, based on their characterizations, and discuss their pros and cons. Based on the limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to follow this area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community but also provides a clear description for researchers outside this research domain.

W3034903425,Unsupervised Person Re-Identification via Softened Similarity Learning,"Person re-identification (re-ID) is an important topic in computer vision. This paper studies the unsupervised setting of re-ID, which does not require any labeled information and thus is freely deployed to new scenarios. There are very few studies under this setting, and one of the best approach till now used iterative clustering and classification, so that unlabeled images are clustered into pseudo classes for a classifier to get trained, and the updated features are used for clustering and so on. This approach suffers two problems, namely, the difficulty of determining the number of clusters, and the hard quantization loss in clustering. In this paper, we follow the iterative training mechanism but discard clustering, since it incurs loss from hard quantization, yet its only product, image-level similarity, can be easily replaced by pairwise computation and a softened classification task. With these improvements, our approach becomes more elegant and is more robust to hyper-parameter changes.

These variables determine the neuron behaviors of competition or cooperation, and they are jointly optimized with the convolutional weight towards more accurate recognition. In Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Networks, the channel relationships are implicitly learned by fully connected layers, and the SE block is integrated at the block-level. We instead introduce a channel normalization layer to reduce the number of parameters and computational complexity. This lightweight layer incorporates a simple l2 normalization, enabling our transformation unit applicable to operator-level without much increase of additional parameters.

W4392298212,Hippopotamus optimization algorithm: a novel nature-inspired optimization algorithm,"Abstract The novelty of this article lies in introducing a novel stochastic technique named the Hippopotamus Optimization (HO) algorithm. The HO is conceived by drawing inspiration from the inherent behaviors observed in hippopotamuses, showcasing an innovative approach in metaheuristic methodology. The HO is conceptually defined using a trinary-phase model that incorporates their position updating in rivers or ponds, defensive strategies against predators, and evasion methods, which are mathematically formulated. It attained the top rank in 115 out of 161 benchmark functions in finding optimal value, encompassing unimodal and high-dimensional multimodal functions, fixed-dimensional multimodal functions, as well as the CEC 2019 test suite and CEC 2014 test suite dimensions of 10, 30, 50, and 100 and Zigzag Pattern benchmark functions, this suggests that the HO demonstrates a noteworthy proficiency in both exploitation and exploration. Moreover, it effectively balances exploration and exploitation, supporting the search process. In light of the results from addressing four distinct engineering design challenges, the HO has effectively achieved the most efficient resolution while concurrently upholding adherence to the designated constraints. The performance evaluation of the HO algorithm encompasses various aspects, including a comparison with WOA, GWO, SSA, PSO, SCA, FA, GOA, TLBO, MFO, and IWO recognized as the most extensively researched metaheuristics, AOA as recently developed algorithms, and CMA-ES as high-performance optimizers acknowledged for their success in the IEEE CEC competition.

In return, technology shapes work and people. As information communication technology (ICT) becomes ever more embedded in today’s increasingly digital organizations, the nature of our jobs and employees’ work experiences are strongly affected by ICT use. This cross-disciplinary review focuses on work design as a central explanatory vehicle for exploring how individual ICT usage influences employees’ effectiveness and well-being. We evaluated 83 empirical studies. Results show that ICT use affects employees through shaping three key work design aspects: job demands, job autonomy, and relational aspects. To reconcile previous mixed findings on the effects of ICT use on individual workers, we identify two categories of factors that moderate the effects of ICT use on work design: user-technology fit factors and social-technology fit factors. We consolidate the review findings into a comprehensive framework that delineates both the work design processes linking ICT use and employee outcomes and the moderating factors. The review fosters an intellectual conversation across different disciplines, including organizational behavior, management information systems, and computer-mediated communication.

W3115879670,Self-Correction for Human Parsing,"Labeling pixel-level masks for fine-grained semantic segmentation tasks, e.g., human parsing, remains a challenging task. The ambiguous boundary between different semantic parts and those categories with similar appearances are usually confusing for annotators, leading to incorrect labels in ground-truth masks. These label noises will inevitably harm the training process and decrease the performance of the learned models. To tackle this issue, we introduce a noise-tolerant method in this work, called Self-Correction for Human Parsing (SCHP), to progressively promote the reliability of the supervised labels as well as the learned models. In particular, starting from a model trained with inaccurate annotations as initialization, we design a cyclically learning scheduler to infer more reliable pseudo masks by iteratively aggregating the current learned model with the former sub-optimal one in an online manner. Besides, those correspondingly corrected labels can in turn to further boost the model performance. In this way, the models and the labels will reciprocally become more robust and accurate during the self-correction learning cycles. Our SCHP is model-agnostic and can be applied to any human parsing models for further enhancing their performance. Extensive experiments on four human parsing models, including Deeplab V3+, CE2P, OCR and CE2P+, well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SCHP. We achieve the new state-of-the-art results on 6 benchmarks, including LIP, Pascal-Person-Part and ATR for single human parsing, CIHP and MHP for multi-person human parsing and VIP for video human parsing tasks. In addition, benefiting the superiority of SCHP, we achieved the 1st place on all the three human parsing tracks in the 3rd Look Into Person Challenge.

However, there is a lack of research on how the unintended consequences of AI integrated business analytics (AI-BA) influence a firm's overall competitive advantage. In this backdrop, this study aims to identify how factors, such as AI-BA opacity, suboptimal business decisions and perceived risk are responsible for a firm's operational inefficiency and competitive disadvantage. Drawing on the resource-based view, dynamic capability view, and contingency theory, the proposed research model captures the components and effects of an AI-BA opacity on a firm's risk environment and negative performance. The data were gathered from 355 operational, mid-level and senior managers from various service sectors across all different size organisations in India. The results indicated that lack of governance, poor data quality, and inefficient training of key employees led to an AI-BA opacity. It then triggers suboptimal business decisions and higher perceived risk resulting in operational inefficiency. The findings show that operational inefficiency significantly contributes to negative sales growth and employees' dissatisfaction, which result in a competitive disadvantage for a firm. The findings also highlight the significant moderating effect of contingency plan in the nomological chain.",2021-08-01,2021,Nripendra P. Rana; Sheshadri Chatterjee; Yogesh K.

W4285787895,A Review of Generalized Zero-Shot Learning Methods,"Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) aims to train a model for classifying data samples under the condition that some output classes are unknown during supervised learning. To address this challenging task, GZSL leverages semantic information of the seen (source) and unseen (target) classes to bridge the gap between both seen and unseen classes. Since its introduction, many GZSL models have been formulated. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive review on GZSL. First, we provide an overview of GZSL including the problems and challenges. Then, we introduce a hierarchical categorization for the GZSL methods and discuss the representative methods in each category.

W3026072590,Machine Learning Techniques for the Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease,"Alzheimer’s disease is an incurable neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting the elderly population. Efficient automated techniques are needed for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. Many novel approaches are proposed by researchers for classification of Alzheimer’s disease. However, to develop more efficient learning techniques, better understanding of the work done on Alzheimer’s is needed. Here, we provide a review on 165 papers from 2005 to 2019, using various feature extraction and machine learning techniques. The machine learning techniques are surveyed under three main categories: support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and deep learning (DL) and ensemble methods. We present a detailed review on these three approaches for Alzheimer’s with possible future directions.",2020-01-31,2020,M.

W3087811358,What drives the acceptance of autonomous driving? An investigation of acceptance factors from an end-user's perspective,"Autonomous driving is believed to provide numerous benefits for individuals and society, including increased road safety, reduced traffic congestion, and an improved ecological footprint. However, many barriers still hinder the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles. Research has proposed governmental policy strategies to accelerate the diffusion of autonomous driving, but less is known about end-user perceptions of this innovative technology. First, we employ a qualitative research design to identify the elements attributed to individual acceptance of autonomous driving. Furthermore, we organize a research model based on the technology acceptance model, validated with an online survey of 316 participants. The findings reveal how social influence, system characteristics, and individual factors determine individual acceptance of autonomous driving.

W4313023122,Rethinking Semantic Segmentation: A Prototype View,"Prevalent semantic segmentation solutions, despite their different network designs (FCN based or attention based) and mask decoding strategies (parametric softmax based or pixel-query based), can be placed in one category, by considering the softmax weights or query vectors as learnable class prototypes. In light of this prototype view, this study uncovers several limitations of such parametric segmentation regime, and proposes a nonparametric alternative based on non-learnable prototypes. Instead of prior methods learning a single weight/query vector for each class in a fully parametric manner, our model represents each class as a set of non-learnable prototypes, relying solely on the mean fea-tures of several training pixels within that class. The dense prediction is thus achieved by nonparametric nearest prototype retrieving. This allows our model to directly shape the pixel embedding space, by optimizing the arrangement between embedded pixels and anchored prototypes. It is able to handle arbitrary number of classes with a constant amount of learnable parameters. We empirically show that, with FCN based and attention based segmentation models (i.e., HR-Net, Swin, SegFormer) and backbones (i.e., ResNet, HRNet, Swin, MiT), our nonparametric framework yields compel-ling results over several datasets (i.e., ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff), and performs well in the large-vocabulary situation. We expect this work will provoke a rethink of the current de facto semantic segmentation model design.",2022-06-01,2022,Tianfei Zhou; Wenguan Wang; Ender Konukoğlu; Luc Van Goo,University of Technology Sydney,2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),269,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr52688.2022.00261,AI_Machine_Learning,Softmax function; Computer science; Segmentation; Pixel; Nonparametric statistics,0.475
W4379051813,Response surface methodology (RSM) for optimizing engine performance and emissions fueled with biofuel: Review of RSM for sustainability energy transition,"Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is a statistical method to design experiments and optimize the effect of process variables. RSM is based on the principles of design of experiments or DOE. Design of experiments or DOE is a field of applied statistics that plans, conducts, analyses, and interprets controlled tests to assess factors that affect parameter values. Response surface methodology or RSM uses a statistical method for designing experiments and optimization. Despite the potential of response surface methodology to predict and optimize engine performance and emissions characteristics, a comprehensive review on RSM for biofuels, particularly for internal combustion engines (ICEs), is difficult to find. The review of response surface methodology is sometimes included together with other machine learning approaches such as ANN. Therefore, a review article that is exclusively written to address the specific of RSM for biofuel and ICE is required. This review article offers a fresh perspective on the application of RSM for biofuel in ICE. This article aims to critically review the RSM to optimize engine performance and emissions using biofuel. The study concludes with several possible research gaps for future works of RSM biofuel application. Although response surface methodology or RSM has drawbacks such as extrapolation inaccuracy outside the investigational ranges and discrete variables error, RSM has numerous advantages to design, model, estimate, and optimize biofuel for ICE with satisfactory accuracy. With its prediction and optimization capability, response surface methodology has the potential to assist the development of ICE optimization powered by biofuel for sustainability energy transition.",2023-06-01,2023,Ibham Veza; Martin Spraggon; I.M.

W2999235762,"Would you like to shop via mobile app technology? The technology acceptance model, social factors and purchase intention","This study investigates how technology acceptance model (TAM) factors and social factors determine customer purchase intention. Although previous studies on mobile apps have investigated TAM, critical social factors have been neglected, thus, reinforcing the need to study the latter’s contribution to consumer purchase intention. Accordingly, this study examines social influence and peer influence in the TAM and collects 777 questionnaires from Digikala app users. Data were then analysed using structural equation modelling by AMOS. The findings indicate that perceived usefulness does not have a significant effect on attitude towards mobile app use. However, perceived ease of use, social and peer influence, and intention to purchase were shown to exhibit positive effects on attitude in this regard. The results also demonstrate that attitude towards mobile app use is a full mediator on three paths of the model. Finally, moderation analysis showed that only age has a mediating effect on the path from perceived usefulness to attitude towards mobile app use.",2020-01-15,2020,Arash Vahdat; Ali Alizadeh; Sara Quach; Nicolas Hamelin,Griffith University,Australasian Marketing Journal (AMJ),268,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ausmj.2020.01.002,AI_Machine_Learning,Technology acceptance model; Moderation; Structural equation modeling; Psychology; Mobile apps,0.15
W3147597595,Learning to Estimate Hidden Motions with Global Motion Aggregation,"Occlusions pose a significant challenge to optical flow algorithms that rely on local evidences. We consider an occluded point to be one that is imaged in the reference frame but not in the next, a slight overloading of the standard definition since it also includes points that move out-of-frame. Estimating the motion of these points is extremely difficult, particularly in the two-frame setting. Previous work relies on CNNs to learn occlusions, without much success, or requires multiple frames to reason about occlusions using temporal smoothness. In this paper, we argue that the occlusion problem can be better solved in the two-frame case by modelling image self-similarities. We introduce a global motion aggregation module, a transformer-based approach to find long-range dependencies between pixels in the first image, and perform global aggregation on the corresponding motion features. We demonstrate that the optical flow estimates in the occluded regions can be significantly improved without damaging the performance in non-occluded regions. This approach obtains new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Sintel dataset, improving the average end-point error by 13.6% on Sintel Final and 13.7% on Sintel Clean.

W4291020776,Self-emergence of robust solitons in a microcavity,"Abstract In many disciplines, states that emerge in open systems far from equilibrium are determined by a few global parameters 1,2 . These states can often mimic thermodynamic equilibrium, a classic example being the oscillation threshold of a laser 3 that resembles a phase transition in condensed matter. However, many classes of states cannot form spontaneously in dissipative systems, and this is the case for cavity solitons 2 that generally need to be induced by external perturbations, as in the case of optical memories 4,5 . In the past decade, these highly localized states have enabled important advancements in microresonator-based optical frequency combs 6,7 . However, the very advantages that make cavity solitons attractive for memories—their inability to form spontaneously from noise—have created fundamental challenges. As sources, microcombs require spontaneous and reliable initiation into a desired state that is intrinsically robust 8–20 . Here we show that the slow non-linearities of a free-running microresonator-filtered fibre laser 21 can transform temporal cavity solitons into the system’s dominant attractor. This phenomenon leads to reliable self-starting oscillation of microcavity solitons that are naturally robust to perturbations, recovering spontaneously even after complete disruption. These emerge repeatably and controllably into a large region of the global system parameter space in which specific states, highly stable over long timeframes, can be achieved.",2022-08-10,2022,Maxwell Rowley; Pierre-Henry Hanzard; Antonio Cutrona; Hualong Bao; Sai T.

W3092879151,WildDeepfake,"In recent years, the abuse of a face swap technique called deepfake has raised enormous public concerns. So far, a large number of deepfake videos (known as ""deepfakes"") have been crafted and uploaded to the internet, calling for effective countermeasures. One promising countermeasure against deepfakes is deepfake detection. Several deepfake datasets have been released to support the training and testing of deepfake detectors, such as DeepfakeDetection [1] and FaceForensics++ [23]. While this has greatly advanced deepfake detection, most of the real videos in these datasets are filmed with a few volunteer actors in limited scenes, and the fake videos are crafted by researchers using a few popular deepfake softwares. Detectors developed on these datasets may become less effective against real-world deepfakes on the internet. To better support detection against real-world deepfakes, in this paper, we introduce a new dataset WildDeepfake, which consists of 7,314 face sequences extracted from 707 deepfake videos collected completely from the internet. WildDeepfake is a small dataset that can be used, in addition to existing datasets, to develop and test the effectiveness of deepfake detectors against real-world deepfakes. We conduct a systematic evaluation of a set of baseline detection networks on both existing and our WildDeepfake datasets, and show that WildDeepfake is indeed a more challenging dataset, where the detection performance can decrease drastically. We also propose two (eg. 2D and 3D) Attention-based Deepfake Detection Networks (ADDNets) to leverage the attention masks on real/fake faces for improved detection. We empirically verify the effectiveness of ADDNets on both existing datasets and WildDeepfake.

W4385484319,A multilevel review of artificial intelligence in organizations: Implications for organizational behavior research and practice,"Summary The rising use of artificially intelligent (AI) technologies, including generative AI tools, in organizations is undeniable. As these systems become increasingly integrated into organizational practices and processes, understanding their impact on workers' experiences and job designs is critical. However, the ongoing discourse surrounding AI use in the workplace remains divided. Proponents of the technology extol its benefits for enhancing efficiency and productivity, while others voice concerns about the potential harm to human workers. To provide greater clarity on this pressing issue, this article presents a systematic review of empirical research that sheds light on the implications of AI use at work. Organized under five inductively generated themes within a multilevel framework, we uncover individual, group, and organizational factors that shape the interplay between humans and AI. Specifically, the themes are: (1) human–AI collaboration; (2) perceptions of algorithmic and human capabilities; (3) worker attitudes towards AI; (4) AI as a control mechanism in algorithmic management of platform‐based work; and (5) labor market implications of AI use. Our review offers insights into these themes and identifies five pathways for future research.

W3092843175,The Sustainability of Artificial Intelligence: An Urbanistic Viewpoint from the Lens of Smart and Sustainable Cities,"The popularity and application of artificial intelligence (AI) are increasing rapidly all around the world—where, in simple terms, AI is a technology which mimics the behaviors commonly associated with human intelligence. Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI.

W3133518153,Anomaly Detection on Attributed Networks via Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning,"Anomaly detection on attributed networks attracts considerable research interests due to wide applications of attributed networks in modeling a wide range of complex systems. Recently, the deep learning-based anomaly detection methods have shown promising results over shallow approaches, especially on networks with high-dimensional attributes and complex structures. However, existing approaches, which employ graph autoencoder as their backbone, do not fully exploit the rich information of the network, resulting in suboptimal performance. Furthermore, these methods do not directly target anomaly detection in their learning objective and fail to scale to large networks due to the full graph training mechanism. To overcome these limitations, in this article, we present a novel Contrastive self-supervised Learning framework for Anomaly detection on attributed networks (CoLA for abbreviation). Our framework fully exploits the local information from network data by sampling a novel type of contrastive instance pair, which can capture the relationship between each node and its neighboring substructure in an unsupervised way. Meanwhile, a well-designed graph neural network (GNN)-based contrastive learning model is proposed to learn informative embedding from high-dimensional attributes and local structure and measure the agreement of each instance pairs with its outputted scores. The multiround predicted scores by the contrastive learning model are further used to evaluate the abnormality of each node with statistical estimation. In this way, the learning model is trained by a specific anomaly detection-aware target. Furthermore, since the input of the GNN module is batches of instance pairs instead of the full network, our framework can adapt to large networks flexibly. Experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on all seven benchmark data sets.",2021-04-05,2021,Yixin Liu; Zhao Li; Shirui Pan; Chen Gong; Chuan Zhou,Monash University,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,262,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2021.3068344,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Anomaly detection; Autoencoder; Artificial intelligence; Exploit,0.7

W3038721901,Fuzzy Detection Aided Real-Time and Robust Visual Tracking Under Complex Environments,"Today, a new generation of artificial intelligence has brought several new research domains such as computer vision (CV). Thus, target tracking, the base of CV, has been a hotspot research domain. Correlation filter (CF)-based algorithm has been the basis of real-time tracking algorithms because of the high tracking efficiency. However, CF-based algorithms usually failed to track objects in complex environments. Therefore, this article proposes a fuzzy detection strategy to prejudge the tracking result. If the prejudge process determines that the tracking result is not good enough in the current frame, the stored target template is used for following tracking to avoid the template pollution. During testing on the OTB100 dataset, the experimental results show that the proposed auxiliary detection strategy improves the tracking robustness under complex environment by ensuring the tracking speed.",2020-07-02,2020,Shuai Liu; Shuai Wang; Xinyu Liu; Chin‐Teng Lin; Zhihan Lv,University of Technology Sydney,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,261,https://doi.org/10.1109/tfuzz.2020.3006520,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Robustness (evolution); Computer vision; Fuzzy logic,0.475

It seems a natural choice to apply DL on Android malware detection. However, there exist challenges for researchers and practitioners, such as choice of DL architecture, feature extraction and processing, performance evaluation, and even gathering adequate data of high quality. In this survey, we aim to address the challenges by systematically reviewing the latest progress in DL-based Android malware detection and classification. We organize the literature according to the DL architecture, including FCN, CNN, RNN, DBN, AE, and hybrid models.

W4200090259,Climatic and soil factors explain the two-dimensional spectrum of global plant trait variation,"Abstract Plant functional traits can predict community assembly and ecosystem functioning and are thus widely used in global models of vegetation dynamics and land–climate feedbacks. Still, we lack a global understanding of how land and climate affect plant traits. A previous global analysis of six traits observed two main axes of variation: (1) size variation at the organ and plant level and (2) leaf economics balancing leaf persistence against plant growth potential. The orthogonality of these two axes suggests they are differently influenced by environmental drivers. We find that these axes persist in a global dataset of 17 traits across more than 20,000 species. We find a dominant joint effect of climate and soil on trait variation. Additional independent climate effects are also observed across most traits, whereas independent soil effects are almost exclusively observed for economics traits. Variation in size traits correlates well with a latitudinal gradient related to water or energy limitation. In contrast, variation in economics traits is better explained by interactions of climate with soil fertility. These findings have the potential to improve our understanding of biodiversity patterns and our predictions of climate change impacts on biogeochemical cycles.",2021-12-23,2021,Julia Joswig; Christian Wirth; Meredith C.

W3010268307,State-of-Health Estimation Based on Differential Temperature for Lithium Ion Batteries,"State-of-health (SOH) estimation is necessary for lithium ion batteries due to ineluctable battery ageing. Existing SOH estimation methods mainly focus on voltage characteristics without considering temperature variation in the process of health degradation. In this article, we propose a novel SOH estimation method based on battery surface temperature. The differential temperature curves during constant charging are analyzed and found to be strongly related to SOH. Part of the differential temperature curves in a voltage range is adopted to establish a relationship with SOH using support vector regression. The influence of battery discrepancy, voltage range, and sampling step are systematically discussed and the best combination of voltage range and sampling step is determined using leave-one-out validation. The proposed method is then validated and compared with an incremental capacity analysis (ICA)-based SOH estimation method using the Oxford and NASA datasets, which were collected from different cells under different conditions, respectively.

W3093859232,Understanding the role of employees in digital transformation: conceptualization of digital literacy of employees as a multi-dimensional organizational affordance,"Purpose Much of recent academic and professional interest in exploring digital transformation and enterprise systems has focused on the technology or the organizations' external forces, leaving internal factors, in particular employees, overlooked. The purpose of this paper is to explore digital literacy of employees as an organizational affordance to capture contextual factors within which digital technologies are situated and are used. Design/methodology/approach We used the evidence-based practice for information systems approach, and undertook a systematic literature review of 30 papers coupled with brainstorming with 11 professional experts on the neglected topic of digital literacy and its assessment. Findings This paper draws upon affordance theory, and develops a novel framework for conceptualization of digital literacy of employees as an organizational affordance. We do this by distinguishing digital literacy at the individual level and organizational level, and by assessing digital literacy through Information/Cognitive and Social Practice/Articulation affordances. Research limitations/implications The current paper contributes to the notion of organizational affordances by examining the effect of interactions between employee-technology through digital literacy of employees in using digital technologies. We offer a novel conceptualization of digital literacy to improve understanding of the role of employee in digital transformation and utilization of enterprise systems. Thus, our definition of digital literacy offers an extension to the recent discussions in the IS literature regarding the actualization of affordances by bringing a lens of employees into the process. Practical implications This paper operationalizes digital literacy at organizational and individual levels, and offers managers a high-level tool to assess digital literacy of their employees. By doing so, managers can achieve the fit between employees' capabilities and digital technologies that will improve affordance actualization and support their digital transformation initiatives. Originality/value The study is one of early attempts to apply and extend affordance theory on digital literacy at organizational level by not limiting the concept to the individual level. The proposed framework improves the communication among researchers and between researchers and practitioners.",2020-10-21,2020,Dilek Çetindamar; Babak Abedin,University of Technology Sydney,Journal of Enterprise Information Management,258,https://doi.org/10.1108/jeim-01-2020-0010,AI_Machine_Learning,Affordance; Conceptualization; Digital literacy; Knowledge management; Digital transformation,0.717

W3017881119,IntruDTree: A Machine Learning Based Cyber Security Intrusion Detection Model,"Cyber security has recently received enormous attention in today’s security concerns, due to the popularity of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), the tremendous growth of computer networks, and the huge number of relevant applications. Thus, detecting various cyber-attacks or anomalies in a network and building an effective intrusion detection system that performs an essential role in today’s security is becoming more important. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning techniques, can be used for building such a data-driven intelligent intrusion detection system. In order to achieve this goal, in this paper, we present an Intrusion Detection Tree (“IntruDTree”) machine-learning-based security model that first takes into account the ranking of security features according to their importance and then build a tree-based generalized intrusion detection model based on the selected important features. This model is not only effective in terms of prediction accuracy for unseen test cases but also minimizes the computational complexity of the model by reducing the feature dimensions. Finally, the effectiveness of our IntruDTree model was examined by conducting experiments on cybersecurity datasets and computing the precision, recall, fscore, accuracy, and ROC values to evaluate. We also compare the outcome results of IntruDTree model with several traditional popular machine learning methods such as the naive Bayes classifier, logistic regression, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbor, to analyze the effectiveness of the resulting security model.",2020-05-06,2020,Iqbal H.

This article reports research which applied Kearney et al.'s framework as a lens to examine student experience of digital learning at home during Covid-19. This framework provides three characteristics that influence learners' experience when using digital devices for learning: personalisation, authenticity and collaboration. High school students in their final two years of schooling (n = 1975) responded to a questionnaire consisting of quantitative and qualitative questions, with qualitative data analysed thematically and quantitative data with descriptive statistics. Aspects of Kearney et al.'s framework were reflected in participants' experience, but further characteristics were identified.

W3148898878,Beyond intrinsic and extrinsic motivation: A meta-analysis on self-determination theory’s multidimensional conceptualization of work motivation,"This meta-analysis aims to shed light on the added value of the complex multidimensional view on motivation of Self-determination theory (SDT). We assess the unique and incremental validity of each of SDT’s types of motivation in predicting organizational behavior, and examine SDT’s core proposition that increasing self-determined types of motivation should have increasingly positive outcomes. Meta-analytic findings (124 samples) support SDT, but also adds precision to its predictions: Intrinsic motivation is the most important type of motivation for employee well-being, attitudes and behavior, yet identified regulation is more powerful in predicting performance and organizational citizenship behavior. Furthermore, introjection has both positive and negative consequences, while external regulation has limited associations with employee behavior and has well-being costs. Amotivation only has negative consequences. We address conceptual and methodological implications arising from this research and exemplify how these results may inform and clarify lingering issues in the literature on employee motivation.",2021-04-07,2021,Anja Van den Broeck; Joshua L.

W2999650510,Multi-Objective Design Optimization of an IPMSM Based on Multilevel Strategy,"The multiobjective optimization design of interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) is a challenge due to the high dimension and huge computation cost of finite element analysis. This article presents a new multilevel optimization strategy for efficient multiobjective optimization of an IPMSM. To determine the multilevel optimization strategy, Pearson correlation coefficient analysis and cross-factor variance analysis techniques are employed to evaluate the correlations of design parameters and optimization objectives. A three-level optimization structure is obtained for the investigated IPMSM based on the analysis results, and different optimization parameters and objectives are assigned to different levels. To improve the optimization efficiency, the Kriging model is employed to approximate the finite element analysis for the multiobjective optimization in each level. It is found that the proposed method can provide optimal design schemes with a better performance, such as smaller torque ripple and lower power loss for the investigated IPMSM, while the needed computation cost is reduced significantly. Finally, experimental results based on a prototype are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method. The proposed method can be applied for the efficient multiobjective optimization of other electrical machines with high dimensions.",2020-01-15,2020,Xiaodong Sun; Zhou Shi; Gang Lei; Youguang Guo; Jianguo Zhu,University of Technology Sydney,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,256,https://doi.org/10.1109/tie.2020.2965463,AI_Machine_Learning,Multi-objective optimization; Computation; Computer science; Torque ripple; Finite element method,0.225
W3033046106,A Novel Bi-Hemispheric Discrepancy Model for EEG Emotion Recognition,"Neuroscience study has revealed the discrepancy of emotion expression between the left and right hemispheres of human brain. Inspired by this study, in this article, we propose a novel bi-hemispheric discrepancy model (BiHDM) to learn this discrepancy information between the two hemispheres to improve electroencephalograph (EEG) emotion recognition. Concretely, we first employ four directed recurrent neural networks (RNNs) based on two spatial orientations to traverse electrode signals on two separate brain regions. This enables the proposed model to obtain the deep representations of all the EEG electrodes’ signals that keep their intrinsic spatial dependence. Upon this representation, a pairwise subnetwork is designed to explicitly capture the discrepancy information between the two hemispheres and extract higher level features for final classification. Furthermore, considering the presence of the domain shift between training and testing data, we incorporate a domain discriminator that adversarially induces the overall feature learning module to generate emotion related but domain-invariant feature representation so as to further promote EEG emotion recognition. Experiments are conducted on three public EEG emotional data sets, in which we evaluate the performance of the proposed BiHDM as well as investigated the important brain areas in emotion expression and explore to use less electrodes to achieve comparable results. These experimental results jointly demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed BiHDM model in solving the EEG emotion recognition problem.",2020-06-01,2020,Yang Li; Lei Wang; Wenming Zheng; Yuan Zong; Lei Qi,University of Wollongong,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems,256,https://doi.org/10.1109/tcds.2020.2999337,AI_Machine_Learning,Electroencephalography; Computer science; Speech recognition; Emotion recognition; Cognitive psychology,0.55
W3028431654,"Prediction: Coveted, Yet Forsaken? Introducing a Cross‐Validated Predictive Ability Test in Partial Least Squares Path Modeling","ABSTRACT Management researchers often develop theories and policies that are forward‐looking. The prospective outlook of predictive modeling, where a model predicts unseen or new data, can complement the retrospective nature of causal‐explanatory modeling that dominates the field. Partial least squares (PLS) path modeling is an excellent tool for building theories that offer both explanation and prediction. A limitation of PLS, however, is the lack of a statistical test to assess whether a proposed or alternative theoretical model offers significantly better out‐of‐sample predictive power than a benchmark or an established model. Such an assessment of predictive power is essential for theory development and validation, and for selecting a model on which to base managerial and policy decisions. We introduce the cross‐validated predictive ability test (CVPAT) to conduct a pairwise comparison of predictive power of competing models, and substantiate its performance via multiple Monte Carlo studies. We propose a stepwise predictive model comparison procedure to guide researchers, and demonstrate CVPAT's practical utility using the well‐known American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) model.",2020-05-22,2020,Benjamin D.

W3046782317,Innovations in teacher education at the time of COVID19: an Australian perspective,"The university sector was hit hard by COVID-19 in early 2020 with global calls for universities to lockdown. The teacher education sector in most countries, including Australia, had not anticipated the shift to off-campus teaching of such a massive scale and the sector was not well prepared for the challenge. This paper reports how the Australian education sector responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and details how one Australian university implemented a number of innovations changing the mode of teaching and move to a fully online environment for all initial teacher education programmes. The innovations included the conversion of all face to face course work units into online units, including synchronous and asynchronous learning opportunities. The initial impact of the innovations on pre-service teachers was captured through systematic measures of engagement with the online content. Using these measures, we interviewed four academics who were identified as supporting high levels of interaction. We were keen to understand what contributed to fostering high levels of interaction of pre-service teachers. Key lessons learnt from the analysis are discussed with a hope that these practices might benefit others looking for ways to provide high-quality teacher education programmes during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-07-31,2020,Janet Scull; Michael Phillips; Umesh Sharma; Kathryn Garnier,Monash University,Journal of Education for Teaching International Research and Pedagogy,254,https://doi.org/10.1080/02607476.2020.1802701,AI_Machine_Learning,Teacher education; Asynchronous communication; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Perspective (graphical); Distance education,0.3
W3004340854,A Review of Radio Frequency Fingerprinting Techniques,"Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting techniques have been used as an extra security layer for wireless devices. Unique fingerprints are used to identify wireless devices in order to avoid spoofing or impersonating attacks. These unique features can be extracted from imperfections of analog components during the manufacturing. This paper presents a general review of recent progress on RF fingerprinting techniques. Several studies are investigated for RF fingerprinting using different parts of a signal. The majority of these studies have been focused on the transient part of the signal. For this purpose, the transient signal must be extracted precisely. A number of common techniques of transient extraction are theoretically analyzed in this review. Then, some other approaches using the modulated part of the signal are also discussed. For all these approaches, the applied methodologies, the classification algorithms and a taxonomy of features are described. A comprehensive overview of the methods in RF fingerprinting is presented to demonstrate the state-of-the-art works.",2020-02-02,2020,Naeimeh Soltanieh; Yaser Norouzi; Yang Yang; Nemai Chandra Karmakar,University of Technology Sydney,IEEE Journal of Radio Frequency Identification,253,https://doi.org/10.1109/jrfid.2020.2968369,AI_Machine_Learning,Radio frequency; Computer science; Spoofing attack; Wireless; SIGNAL (programming language),0.567
W3080510869,Conversation Technology With Micro-Learning: The Impact of Chatbot-Based Learning on Students’ Learning Motivation and Performance,"This study investigated the impact of a chatbot-based micro-learning system on students’ learning motivation and performance. A quasi-experiment was conducted with 99 first-year students taking part in a basic computer course on number system conversion. The students were assigned to a traditional learning group or a chatbot-based micro-learning group. After the experiment, both groups achieved a comparable performance, suggesting that students are sufficiently competent to learn independently in the chatbot-based learning environment without the need for continuous face-to-face delivery. Moreover, students in the chatbot learning group attained significantly higher intrinsic motivation than the traditional learning group with perceived choice and perceived value as core predictors of intrinsic motivation. Further analysis with the Johnson-Neyman procedure revealed differences on interaction between the perceived choice and the learning environments. For students with a high initial perceived choice (&gt;=5.1), chatbot-based learning further enhances their post choice motivation whereas for students with a low initial perceived choice (&lt;=3.0), the traditional classroom is more suitable to enhance their post choice motivation. The implications of the findings can help instructors to incorporate chatbot-based learning in the classroom.",2020-08-21,2020,Jiaqi Yin; Tiong‐Thye Goh; Yang Bing; Xiaobin Yang,Victoria University of Wellington,Journal of Educational Computing Research,253,https://doi.org/10.1177/0735633120952067,AI_Machine_Learning,Chatbot; Psychology; Motivation to learn; Conversation; Mathematics education,0.433

We examined, in a banking services context, whether consumers preferred AI or Human online customer service applications using an experimental design across three field-based experiments. The results show that, in the case of low-complexity tasks, consumers considered the problem-solving ability of AI to be greater than that of human customer service and were more likely to use AI while, conversely, for high-complexity tasks, they viewed human customer service as superior and were more likely to use it than AI. Moreover, we found that perceived problem-solving ability mediated the effects of customers’ service usage intentions (i.e., their preference for AI vs. Human) with task complexity serving as a boundary condition. Here we discuss our research and the results and conclude by offering practical suggestions for banks seeking to reach customers and engage with them more effectively by leveraging the distinctive features of AI customer service.",2020-05-21,2020,Yingzi Xu; Chih-Hui Shieh; Patrick van Esch; I-Ling Ling,Auckland University of Technology,Australasian Marketing Journal (AMJ),252,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ausmj.2020.03.005,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Service (business); Context (archaeology); Task (project management); Order (exchange),0.508
W3035186652,Salience-Guided Cascaded Suppression Network for Person Re-Identification,"Employing attention mechanisms to model both global and local features as a final pedestrian representation has become a trend for person re-identification (Re-ID) algorithms. A potential limitation of these methods is that they focus on the most salient features, but the re-identification of a person may rely on diverse clues masked by the most salient features in different situations, e.g., body, clothes or even shoes. To handle this limitation, we propose a novel Salience-guided Cascaded Suppression Network (SCSN) which enables the model to mine diverse salient features and integrate these features into the final representation by a cascaded manner. Our work makes the following contributions: (i) We observe that the previously learned salient features may hinder the network from learning other important information. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a cascaded suppression strategy, which enables the network to mine diverse potential useful features that be masked by the other salient features stage-by-stage and each stage integrates different feature embedding for the last discriminative pedestrian representation. (ii) We propose a Salient Feature Extraction (SFE) unit, which can suppress the salient features learned in the previous cascaded stage and then adaptively extracts other potential salient feature to obtain different clues of pedestrians. (iii) We develop an efficient feature aggregation strategy that fully increases the network's capacity for all potential salience features. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four large-scale datasets. Especially, our approach exceeds the current best method by over 7% on the CUHK03 dataset.",2020-06-01,2020,Xuesong Chen; Canmiao Fu; Yong Zhao; Feng Zheng; Jingkuan Song,University of Technology Sydney,2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),251,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr42600.2020.00336,AI_Machine_Learning,Salient; Salience (neuroscience); Computer science; Discriminative model; Artificial intelligence,0.267
W3117379804,Deep Learning-Based Traffic Safety Solution for a Mixture of Autonomous and Manual Vehicles in a 5G-Enabled Intelligent Transportation System,"It is expected that a mixture of autonomous and manual vehicles will persist as a part of the intelligent transportation system (ITS) for many decades. Thus, addressing the safety issues arising from this mix of autonomous and manual vehicles before autonomous vehicles are entirely popularized is crucial. As the ITS system has increased in complexity, autonomous vehicles exhibit problems such as a low intention recognition rate and poor real-time performance when predicting the driving direction; these problems seriously affect the safety and comfort of mixed traffic systems. Therefore, the ability of autonomous vehicles to predict the driving direction in real time according to the surrounding traffic environment must be improved and researchers must work to create a more mature ITS. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based traffic safety solution for a mixture of autonomous and manual vehicles in a 5G-enabled ITS. In this scheme, a driving trajectory dataset and a natural-driving dataset are employed as the network inputs to long-term memory networks in the 5G-enabled ITS: the probability matrix of each intention is calculated by the softmax function. Then, the final intention probability is obtained by fusing the mean rule in the decision layer. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves intention recognition rates of 91.58% and 90.88% for left and right lane changes, respectively, effectively improving both accuracy and real-time intention recognition and improving the lane change problem in a mixed traffic environment.",2020-12-22,2020,Keping Yu; Long Lin; Mamoun Alazab; Liang Tan; Bo Gu,Charles Darwin University,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,251,https://doi.org/10.1109/tits.2020.3042504,AI_Machine_Learning,Softmax function; Intelligent transportation system; Scheme (mathematics); Computer science; Trajectory,0.433

Accordingly, we propose an effective self-supervised learning-based tracker in a deep correlation framework (named: self-SDCT). Motivated by the forward-backward tracking consistency of a robust tracker, we propose a multi-cycle consistency loss as self-supervised information for learning feature extraction network from adjacent video frames. At the training stage, we generate pseudo-labels of consecutive video frames by forward-backward prediction under a Siamese correlation tracking framework and utilize the proposed multi-cycle consistency loss to learn a feature extraction network. Furthermore, we propose a similarity dropout strategy to enable some low-quality training sample pairs to be dropped and also adopt a cycle trajectory consistency loss in each sample pair to improve the training loss function. At the tracking stage, we employ the pre-trained feature extraction network to extract features and utilize a Siamese correlation tracking framework to locate the target using forward tracking alone.

W3037146998,"Path Planning Strategies to Optimize Accuracy, Quality, Build Time and Material Use in Additive Manufacturing: A Review","Additive manufacturing (AM) is the process of joining materials layer by layer to fabricate products based on 3D models. Due to the layer-by-layer nature of AM, parts with complex geometries, integrated assemblies, customized geometry or multifunctional designs can now be manufactured more easily than traditional subtractive manufacturing. Path planning in AM is an important step in the process of manufacturing products. The final fabricated qualities, properties, etc., will be different when using different path strategies, even using the same AM machine and process parameters. Currently, increasing research studies have been published on path planning strategies with different aims. Due to the rapid development of path planning in AM and various newly proposed strategies, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews on this topic. Therefore, this paper gives a comprehensive understanding of the current status and challenges of AM path planning. This paper reviews and discusses path planning strategies in three categories: improving printed qualities, saving materials/time and achieving objective printed properties. The main findings of this review include: new path planning strategies can be developed by combining some of the strategies in literature with better performance; a path planning platform can be developed to help select the most suitable path planning strategy with required properties; research on path planning considering energy consumption can be carried out in the future; a benchmark model for testing the performance of path planning strategies can be designed; the trade-off among different fabricated properties can be considered as a factor in future path planning design processes; and lastly, machine learning can be a powerful tool to further improve path planning strategies in the future.",2020-06-28,2020,Jingchao Jiang; Yongsheng Ma,University of Auckland,Micromachines,247,https://doi.org/10.3390/mi11070633,AI_Machine_Learning,Motion planning; Path (computing); Process (computing); Computer science; Subtractive color,0.867
W3035785571,State-of-Charge Estimation of Li-Ion Battery in Electric Vehicles: A Deep Neural Network Approach,"The state of charge (SOC) is a crucial parameter of a battery management system for Li-ion batteries. The SOC indicates the amount of charge left in the battery of electric vehicles-akin to the fuel gauge in combustion vehicles. An accurate SOC knowledge contributes largely to the longevity, performance, and reliability of the battery. However, the SOC of Li-ion batteries cannot be easily measured by any apparatus. Furthermore, the SOC can also be influenced by numerous incalculable factors such as battery chemistry, ambient environment, aging factor, etc. In this article, we propose an SOC estimation model for a Li-ion battery using an improved deep neural network (DNN) approach for electric vehicle applications. We found that a DNN with a sufficient number of hidden layers is capable of predicting the SOC of the unseen drive cycles during training. We developed a series of DNN models with a varying number of hidden layers, and its training algorithm was to investigate their respective performance when evaluated on different drive cycles. We observe that the increasing number of hidden layers in the DNN (up to four hidden layers) decreases the error rate and improves SOC estimation. An additional increase in the number of hidden layers beyond that increases the error rate. In this study, we show that a four-hidden-layer DNN trained on Dynamic Stress Test drive cycle is capable of predicting SOC values unexpectedly well of other unseen drive cycles such as Federal Urban Driving Schedule, Beijing Dynamic Stress Test, and Supplemental Federal Test Procedure, respectively.",2020-06-22,2020,Dickshon N.

W3013220041,A world of possibilities: six restoration strategies to support the United Nation's Decade on Ecosystem Restoration,"Ecological restoration is practiced worldwide as a direct response to the degradation and destruction of ecosystems. In addition to its ecological impact it has enormous potential to improve population health, socioeconomic well‐being, and the integrity of diverse national and ethnic cultures. In recognition of the critical role of restoration in ecosystem health, the United Nations (UN) declared 2021–2030 as the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. We propose six practical strategies to strengthen the effectiveness and amplify the work of ecological restoration to meet the aspirations of the Decade: (1) incorporate holistic actions, including working at effective scale; (2) include traditional ecological knowledge (TEK); (3) collaborate with allied movements and organizations; (4) advance and apply soil microbiome science and technology; (5) provide training and capacity‐building opportunities for communities and practitioners; and (6) study and show the relationships between ecosystem health and human health. We offer these in the hope of identifying possible leverage points and pathways for collaborative action among interdisciplinary groups already committed to act and support the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Collectively, these six strategies work synergistically to improve human health and also the health of the ecosystems on which we all depend, and can be the basis for a global restorative culture .",2020-03-27,2020,James Aronson; Neva Goodwin; Laura Orlando; Cristina Eisenberg; Adam T.

W3036230919,"COVID-19, Societalization, and the Future of Business in Society","COVID-19 is profoundly affecting almost all aspects of economic and social life globally. Governments have closed borders, banned mass gatherings, and enforced social distancing, generating a new normal for businesses and individual citizens. Measures taken to protect public health have threatened the global economy, necessitating economic stimulus in most countries and reconfiguring the role of business in society. Will the role of business in society return to normal after COVID-19, or will it be reconfigured in enduring and impactful ways? We use Alexander's (2018, 2019) theory of ""societalization"" to examine how socially disruptive extreme events affect the role of business in society. To address this, we apply societalization to the revelatory example of COVID-19 and evaluate its impact on society. Our analysis of the societalization of COVID-19 in the United States shows that concern regarding pandemic disease has moved from the governmental inside to the civic outside, placing strain on society and leading to regulatory response and a significant societal backlash. We discuss three scenarios regarding the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the role of business in society, suggest that societalization provides useful insights into other socially disruptive extreme events, and identify implications for future business and society research.",2020-06-16,2020,Stephen Brammer; Layla Branicki; Martina K.

W3101571838,Understanding the dynamics of biological and neural oscillator networks through exact mean-field reductions: a review,"Many biological and neural systems can be seen as networks of interacting periodic processes. Importantly, their functionality, i.e., whether these networks can perform their function or not, depends on the emerging collective dynamics of the network. Synchrony of oscillations is one of the most prominent examples of such collective behavior and has been associated both with function and dysfunction. Understanding how network structure and interactions, as well as the microscopic properties of individual units, shape the emerging collective dynamics is critical to find factors that lead to malfunction. However, many biological systems such as the brain consist of a large number of dynamical units. Hence, their analysis has either relied on simplified heuristic models on a coarse scale, or the analysis comes at a huge computational cost. Here we review recently introduced approaches, known as the Ott–Antonsen and Watanabe–Strogatz reductions, allowing one to simplify the analysis by bridging small and large scales. Thus, reduced model equations are obtained that exactly describe the collective dynamics for each subpopulation in the oscillator network via few collective variables only. The resulting equations are next-generation models: Rather than being heuristic, they exactly link microscopic and macroscopic descriptions and therefore accurately capture microscopic properties of the underlying system. At the same time, they are sufficiently simple to analyze without great computational effort. In the last decade, these reduction methods have become instrumental in understanding how network structure and interactions shape the collective dynamics and the emergence of synchrony. We review this progress based on concrete examples and outline possible limitations. Finally, we discuss how linking the reduced models with experimental data can guide the way towards the development of new treatment approaches, for example, for neurological disease.",2020-05-27,2020,Christian Bick; Marc Goodfellow; Carlo R.

W3137539129,Human Memory Update Strategy: A Multi-Layer Template Update Mechanism for Remote Visual Monitoring,"In the era of rapid development of artificial intelligence, the integration of multimedia and human-artificial intelligence has become an important research hotspot. Especially in the multimedia environment, effective remote visual monitoring has become the exploration direction of many scholars. The use of traditional correlation filtering (CF) algorithm for real-time monitoring in the context of multimedia is a practical strategy. However, most existing filtering-based visual monitoring algorithms still have the problem of insufficient robustness and effectiveness. Therefore, by considering the strategy of updating human memory, this paper proposes a multi-layer template update mechanism to achieve effective monitoring in a multimedia environment. In this strategy, the weighted template of the high-confidence matching memory is used as the confidence memory, and the unweighted template of the low-confidence matching memory is used as the cognitive memory. Through the alternate use of confidence memory, matching memory, and cognitive memory, it is ensured that the target will not be lost during the monitoring process. Experimental results show that this strategy does not affect the speed (still real-time) and improves the robustness in the multimedia background.",2021-01-01,2021,Shuai Liu; Shuai Wang; Xinyu Liu; Amir H.

W3033193681,A Survey on Deep Learning Techniques for Stereo-Based Depth Estimation,"Estimating depth from RGB images is a long-standing ill-posed problem, which has been explored for decades by the computer vision, graphics, and machine learning communities. Among the existing techniques, stereo matching remains one of the most widely used in the literature due to its strong connection to the human binocular system. Traditionally, stereo-based depth estimation has been addressed through matching hand-crafted features across multiple images. Despite the extensive amount of research, these traditional techniques still suffer in the presence of highly textured areas, large uniform regions, and occlusions. Motivated by their growing success in solving various 2D and 3D vision problems, deep learning for stereo-based depth estimation has attracted a growing interest from the community, with more than 150 papers published in this area between 2014 and 2019. This new generation of methods has demonstrated a significant leap in performance, enabling applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of this new and continuously growing field of research, summarize the most commonly used pipelines, and discuss their benefits and limitations. In retrospect of what has been achieved so far, we also conjecture what the future may hold for deep learning-based stereo for depth estimation research.",2020-10-21,2020,Hamid Laga; Laurent Valentin Jospin; Farid Boussaïd; Mohammed Bennamoun,Murdoch University,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,244,https://doi.org/10.1109/tpami.2020.3032602,AI_Machine_Learning,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Deep learning; Computer vision; Estimation,0.7
W3021297918,Deep Learning Approaches Applied to Remote Sensing Datasets for Road Extraction: A State-Of-The-Art Review,"One of the most challenging research subjects in remote sensing is feature extraction, such as road features, from remote sensing images. Such an extraction influences multiple scenes, including map updating, traffic management, emergency tasks, road monitoring, and others. Therefore, a systematic review of deep learning techniques applied to common remote sensing benchmarks for road extraction is conducted in this study. The research is conducted based on four main types of deep learning methods, namely, the GANs model, deconvolutional networks, FCNs, and patch-based CNNs models. We also compare these various deep learning models applied to remote sensing datasets to show which method performs well in extracting road parts from high-resolution remote sensing images. Moreover, we describe future research directions and research gaps. Results indicate that the largest reported performance record is related to the deconvolutional nets applied to remote sensing images, and the F1 score metric of the generative adversarial network model, DenseNet method, and FCN-32 applied to UAV and Google Earth images are high: 96.08%, 95.72%, and 94.59%, respectively.",2020-05-02,2020,Abolfazl Abdollahi; Biswajeet Pradhan; Nagesh Shukla; Subrata Chakraborty; Abdullah Alamri,University of Technology Sydney,Remote Sensing,243,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12091444,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Deep learning; Remote sensing; Metric (unit); Artificial intelligence,0.55
W3010203931,Storm impacts on phytoplankton community dynamics in lakes,"Abstract In many regions across the globe, extreme weather events such as storms have increased in frequency, intensity, and duration due to climate change. Ecological theory predicts that such extreme events should have large impacts on ecosystem structure and function. High winds and precipitation associated with storms can affect lakes via short‐term runoff events from watersheds and physical mixing of the water column. In addition, lakes connected to rivers and streams will also experience flushing due to high flow rates. Although we have a well‐developed understanding of how wind and precipitation events can alter lake physical processes and some aspects of biogeochemical cycling, our mechanistic understanding of the emergent responses of phytoplankton communities is poor. Here we provide a comprehensive synthesis that identifies how storms interact with lake and watershed attributes and their antecedent conditions to generate changes in lake physical and chemical environments. Such changes can restructure phytoplankton communities and their dynamics, as well as result in altered ecological function (e.g., carbon, nutrient and energy cycling) in the short‐ and long‐term. We summarize the current understanding of storm‐induced phytoplankton dynamics, identify knowledge gaps with a systematic review of the literature, and suggest future research directions across a gradient of lake types and environmental conditions.",2020-03-05,2020,Jason D.

W3045931268,Privacy-Aware Data Fusion and Prediction With Spatial-Temporal Context for Smart City Industrial Environment,"As one of the cyber–physical–social systems that plays a key role in people's daily activities, a smart city is producing a considerable amount of industrial data associated with transportation, healthcare, business, social activities, and so on. Effectively and efficiently fusing and mining such data from multiple sources can contribute much to the development and improvements of various smart city applications. However, the industrial data collected from the smart city are often sensitive and contain partial user privacy such as spatial–temporal context information. Therefore, it is becoming a necessity to secure user privacy hidden in the smart city data before these data are integrated together for further mining, analyses, and prediction. However, due to the inherent tradeoff between data privacy and data availability, it is often a challenging task to protect users' context privacy while guaranteeing accurate data analysis and prediction results after data fusion. Considering this challenge, a novel privacy-aware data fusion and prediction approach for the smart city industrial environment is put forward in this article, which is based on the classic locality-sensitive hashing technique. At last, our proposal is evaluated by a set of experiments based on a real-world dataset. Experimental results show better prediction performances of our approach compared to other competitive ones.",2020-07-28,2020,Lianyong Qi; Chunhua Hu; Xuyun Zhang; Mohammad R.

Congruent with the principles of Resilience Engineering, over recent years the FRAM has been progressively developed in scientific terms, and increasingly adopted in industrial environments with reportedly successful results. Nevertheless, a wide literature review focused on the method is currently lacking. On these premises, this paper aims to summarise all available published research in English about FRAM. More than 1700 documents from multiple scientific repositories were reviewed through a protocol based on the PRISMA review technique. The paper aims to uncover a number of characteristics of the FRAM research, both in terms of the method's application and of the authors contributing to its development. The systematic analysis explores the method in terms of its methodological aspects, application domains, and enhancements in qualitative and quantitative terms, as well as proposing potential future research directions.",2020-05-22,2020,Riccardo Patriarca; Giulio Di Gravio; Rogier Woltjer; Francesco Costantino; Gesa Praetorius,Macquarie University,Safety Science,241,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104827,AI_Machine_Learning,Framing (construction); Data science; Computer science; Management science; Probabilistic logic,0.3
W3044216884,Machine learning uncovers the most robust self-report predictors of relationship quality across 43 longitudinal couples studies,"Given the powerful implications of relationship quality for health and well-being, a central mission of relationship science is explaining why some romantic relationships thrive more than others. This large-scale project used machine learning (i.e., Random Forests) to 1) quantify the extent to which relationship quality is predictable and 2) identify which constructs reliably predict relationship quality. Across 43 dyadic longitudinal datasets from 29 laboratories, the top relationship-specific predictors of relationship quality were perceived-partner commitment, appreciation, sexual satisfaction, perceived-partner satisfaction, and conflict. The top individual-difference predictors were life satisfaction, negative affect, depression, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety. Overall, relationship-specific variables predicted up to 45% of variance at baseline, and up to 18% of variance at the end of each study. Individual differences also performed well (21% and 12%, respectively). Actor-reported variables (i.e., own relationship-specific and individual-difference variables) predicted two to four times more variance than partner-reported variables (i.e., the partner's ratings on those variables). Importantly, individual differences and partner reports had no predictive effects beyond actor-reported relationship-specific variables alone. These findings imply that the sum of all individual differences and partner experiences exert their influence on relationship quality via a person's own relationship-specific experiences, and effects due to moderation by individual differences and moderation by partner-reports may be quite small. Finally, relationship-quality change (i.e., increases or decreases in relationship quality over the course of a study) was largely unpredictable from any combination of self-report variables. This collective effort should guide future models of relationships.",2020-07-27,2020,Samantha Joel; Paul W. Eastwick; Colleen J. Allison; Ximena B. Arriaga; Zachary G.

W3217748719,Hierarchical Adversarial Attacks Against Graph-Neural-Network-Based IoT Network Intrusion Detection System,"The advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies leads to a wide penetration and large-scale deployment of IoT systems across an entire city or even country. While IoT systems are capable of providing intelligent services, the large amount of data collected and processed in IoT systems also raises serious security concerns. Many research efforts have been devoted to design intelligent network intrusion detection system (NIDS) to prevent misuse of IoT data across smart applications. However, existing approaches may suffer from the issue of limited and imbalanced attack data when training the detection model, which make the system vulnerable especially for those unknown type attacks. In this study, a novel hierarchical adversarial attack (HAA) generation method is introduced to realize the level-aware black-box adversarial attack strategy, targeting the graph neural network (GNN)-based intrusion detection in IoT systems with a limited budget. By constructing a shadow GNN model, an intelligent mechanism based on a saliency map technique is designed to generate adversarial examples by effectively identifying and modifying the critical feature elements with minimal perturbations. A hierarchical node selection algorithm based on random walk with restart (RWR) is developed to select a set of more vulnerable nodes with high attack priority, considering their structural features, and overall loss changes within the targeted IoT network. The proposed HAA generation method is evaluated using the open-source data set UNSW-SOSR2019 with three baseline methods. Comparison results demonstrate its ability in degrading the classification precision by more than 30% in the two state-of-the-art GNN models, GCN and JK-Net, respectively, for NIDS in IoT environments.",2021-11-24,2021,Xiaokang Zhou; Wei Liang; Weimin Li; Ke Yan; Shohei Shimizu,University of Auckland,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,241,https://doi.org/10.1109/jiot.2021.3130434,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Adversarial system; Intrusion detection system; Artificial neural network; Graph,0.775
W3174836973,Distributed Observer-Based Cooperative Control Approach for Uncertain Nonlinear MASs Under Event-Triggered Communication,"The distributed tracking problem for uncertain nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) under event-triggered communication is an important issue. However, existing results provide solutions that can only ensure stability with bounded tracking errors, as asymptotic tracking is difficult to be achieved mainly due to the errors caused by event-triggering mechanisms and system uncertainties. In this article, with the aim of overcoming such difficulty, we propose a new methodology. The subsystems in MASs are divided into two groups, in which the first group consists of the subsystems that can access partial output of the reference system and the second one contains all the remaining subsystems. To estimate the state of the reference system, a new distributed event-triggered observer is first designed for the first group based on a combined output observable condition. Then, a distributed event-triggered observer is proposed for the second group by employing the observer state of the first group. Based on the designed observers, adaptive controllers are derived for all subsystems. It is established that global stability of the closed loop system is ensured and asymptotic convergence of all the tracking errors is achieved. Moreover, a simulation example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2021-06-21,2021,Chao Deng; Changyun Wen; Jiangshuai Huang; Xian‐Ming Zhang; Ying Zou,Swinburne University of Technology,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,239,https://doi.org/10.1109/tac.2021.3090739,AI_Machine_Learning,Control theory (sociology); Observer (physics); Nonlinear system; Convergence (economics); Bounded function,0.358

In order to understand how to progress AI-related research and analysis, this critical review systematically searched top higher education journals for references to the term ‘artificial intelligence’. We reviewed definitions and conducted a discourse analysis of included texts. Our findings identify few, confusing definitions and little overt reference to AI as a research object. We delineated two Discourses. The Discourse of imperative change outlines how AI is seen as an inevitable change to which all must respond. Additionally, the Discourse of altering authority describes how texts position AI as decentring the teacher and spreading authority across staff, machines, corporations and students.

W3036991312,Automated Pavement Crack Segmentation Using U-Net-Based Convolutional Neural Network,"Automated pavement crack image segmentation is challenging because of inherent irregular patterns, lighting conditions, and noise in images. Conventional approaches require a substantial amount of feature engineering to differentiate crack regions from non-affected regions. In this paper, we propose a deep learning technique based on a convolutional neural network to perform segmentation tasks on pavement crack images. Our approach requires minimal feature engineering compared to other machine learning techniques. We propose a U-Net-based network architecture in which we replace the encoder with a pretrained ResNet-34 neural network. We use a ""one-cycle"" training schedule based on cyclical learning rates to speed up the convergence. Our method achieves an $F1$ score of 96% on the CFD dataset and 73% on the Crack500 dataset, outperforming other algorithms tested on these datasets. We perform ablation studies on various techniques that helped us get marginal performance boosts, i.e., the addition of spatial and channel squeeze and excitation (SCSE) modules, training with gradually increasing image sizes, and training various neural network layers with different learning rates.",2020-01-01,2020,Stephen Lau; Edwin K.

W4385774049,A reflection on polymer electrolytes for solid-state lithium metal batteries,"Abstract Before the debut of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in the commodity market, solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) were considered promising high-energy electrochemical energy storage systems before being almost abandoned in the late 1980s because of safety concerns. However, after three decades of development, LIB technologies are now approaching their energy content and safety limits imposed by the rocking chair chemistry. These aspects are prompting the revival of research activities in SSLMB technologies at both academic and industrial levels. In this perspective article, we present a personal reflection on solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), spanning from early development to their implementation in SSLMBs, highlighting key milestones. In particular, we discuss the SPEs’ characteristics taking into account the concept of coupled and decoupled SPEs proposed by C. Austen Angell in the early 1990s. Possible remedies to improve the physicochemical and electrochemical properties of SPEs are also examined. With this article, we also aim to highlight the missing blocks in building ideal SSLMBs and stimulate research towards innovative electrolyte materials for future rechargeable high-energy batteries.",2023-08-12,2023,Ziyu Song; Fangfang Chen; María Martínez‐Ibáñez; Wenfang Feng; Maria Forsyth,Deakin University,Nature Communications,236,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40609-y,AI_Machine_Learning,Lithium metal; Lithium (medication); Electrolyte; Energy density; Nanotechnology,0.508
W3048400690,Coronavirus (Covid-19) and the entrepreneurship education community,"Purpose Covid-19 (coronavirus) has significantly affected education communities particularly in terms of the massive shift towards online learning. This has meant a quick transformation of the curriculum and learning styles to a digital platform. Despite the dramatic change, there is a lack of understanding about what this means particularly for the community of entrepreneurship educators in the higher education sector that rely on practical and immersive training for learning requirements. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a literature review that discusses how communities of entrepreneurship education practitioners can deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. A review of the current literature on Covid-19 and entrepreneurship education is conducted that highlights the need to incorporate a community approach. This enables a better understanding about how communities of educational stakeholders including teachers, students and institutions can facilitate a more proactive and positive attitude. Findings The paper finds that managing the Covid-19 crisis is difficult for entrepreneurship educations due to the need for practical and real life examples. This means the use of augmented reality and artificial intelligence is needed to simulate the real environment. This will enable a more community orientated approach to the study and practice of entrepreneurship.

W3177398206,Abusive supervision: A systematic review and fundamental rethink,"We report a systematic and critical review of abusive supervision research to provide a comprehensive catalogue of the correlates of abusive supervision (i.e., antecedents, outcomes, mediators, and moderators) and identify four major challenges facing the field. First, abusive supervision is conceptualized in a confused manner that conflates followers’ subjective evaluations of abuse with leaders’ behaviors. Second, we consider how conceptual confusion is reflected in and undermines dominant measurement tools. Third, we identify and critique overreliance on cross-sectional survey-based studies and vignette experiments, which vary considerably in the extent to which they can evidence causal effects. Fourth, we consider the fact that abusive supervision is a low base rate phenomenon (i.e., is rarely reported). Using novel and simulated data we demonstrate that most past research is ill-equipped to make claims about the effects of intermediate or high levels of abusive supervision. Throughout, we explain how each challenge limits past research and offer achievable recommendations for a fundamental rethink of abusive supervision. In the discussion, we synthesize the recommendations for rethinking the conceptualization, measurement, and empirical study of abusive supervision. Only by overcoming these challenges will future research be robust enough to provide meaningful theoretical advances and useful policy implications.",2021-06-25,2021,Thomas Fischer; Amy Wei Tian; Allan Lee; David J.

W4229376924,Assessment in the age of artificial intelligence,"In this paper, we argue that a particular set of issues mars traditional assessment practices. They may be difficult for educators to design and implement; only provide discrete snapshots of performance rather than nuanced views of learning; be unadapted to the particular knowledge, skills, and backgrounds of participants; be tailored to the culture of schooling rather than the cultures schooling is designed to prepare students to enter; and assess skills that humans routinely use computers to perform. We review extant artificial intelligence approaches that–at least partially–address these issues and critically discuss whether these approaches present additional challenges for assessment practice.",2022-01-01,2022,Zachari Swiecki; Hassan Khosravi; Guanliang Chen; Roberto Martínez‐Maldonado; Jason M.

W3021091848,The three numbers you need to know about healthcare: the 60-30-10 Challenge,"Abstract Background Healthcare represents a paradox. While change is everywhere, performance has flatlined: 60% of care on average is in line with evidence- or consensus-based guidelines, 30% is some form of waste or of low value, and 10% is harm. The 60-30-10 Challenge has persisted for three decades. Main body Current top-down or chain-logic strategies to address this problem, based essentially on linear models of change and relying on policies, hierarchies, and standardisation, have proven insufficient. Instead, we need to marry ideas drawn from complexity science and continuous improvement with proposals for creating a deep learning health system. This dynamic learning model has the potential to assemble relevant information including patients’ histories, and clinical, patient, laboratory, and cost data for improved decision-making in real time, or close to real time. If we get it right, the learning health system will contribute to care being more evidence-based and less wasteful and harmful. It will need a purpose-designed digital backbone and infrastructure, apply artificial intelligence to support diagnosis and treatment options, harness genomic and other new data types, and create informed discussions of options between patients, families, and clinicians. While there will be many variants of the model, learning health systems will need to spread, and be encouraged to do so, principally through diffusion of innovation models and local adaptations. Conclusion Deep learning systems can enable us to better exploit expanding health datasets including traditional and newer forms of big and smaller-scale data, e.g. genomics and cost information, and incorporate patient preferences into decision-making. As we envisage it, a deep learning system will support healthcare’s desire to continually improve, and make gains on the 60-30-10 dimensions. All modern health systems are awash with data, but it is only recently that we have been able to bring this together, operationalised, and turned into useful information by which to make more intelligent, timely decisions than in the past.",2020-05-04,2020,Jeffrey Braithwaite; Paul Glasziou; Johanna Westbrook,Macquarie University,BMC Medicine,233,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01563-4,AI_Machine_Learning,Exploit; Medicine; Harm; Big data; Health care,0.867
W3030870282,A brief-review of the risk factors for covid-19 severity,"The World Health Organization has emphasized that one of the most important questions to address regarding the covid-19 pandemic is to understand risk factors for disease severity. We conducted a brief review that synthesizes the available evidence and provides a judgment on the consistency of the association between risk factors and a composite end-point of severe-fatal covid-19. Additionally, we also conducted a comparability analysis of risk factors across 17 studies. We found evidence supporting a total of 60 predictors for disease severity, of which seven were deemed of high consistency, 40 of medium and 13 of low. Among the factors with high consistency of association, we found age, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, albumin, body temperature, SOFA score and diabetes. The results suggest that diabetes might be the most consistent comorbidity predicting disease severity and that future research should carefully consider the comparability of reporting cases, factors, and outcomes along the different stages of the natural history of covid-19.",2020-07-10,2020,J.E.

W3035467254,Learning Filter Pruning Criteria for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Acceleration,"Filter pruning has been widely applied to neural network compression and acceleration. Existing methods usually utilize pre-defined pruning criteria, such as Lp-norm, to prune unimportant filters. There are two major limitations to these methods. First, existing methods fail to consider the variety of filter distribution across layers. To extract features of the coarse level to the fine level, the filters of different layers have various distributions. Therefore, it is not suitable to utilize the same pruning criteria to different functional layers. Second, prevailing layer-by-layer pruning methods process each layer independently and sequentially, failing to consider that all the layers in the network collaboratively make the final prediction. In this paper, we propose Learning Filter Pruning Criteria (LFPC) to solve the above problems. Specifically, we develop a differentiable pruning criteria sampler. This sampler is learnable and optimized by the validation loss of the pruned network obtained from the sampled criteria. In this way, we could adaptively select the appropriate pruning criteria for different functional layers. Besides, when evaluating the sampled criteria, LFPC comprehensively consider the contribution of all the layers at the same time. Experiments validate our approach on three image classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our LFPC reduces more than 60% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.83% top-5 accuracy loss.",2020-06-01,2020,Yang He; Yuhang Ding; Ping Liu; Linchao Zhu; Hanwang Zhang,University of Technology Sydney,2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),233,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr42600.2020.00208,AI_Machine_Learning,Pruning; Computer science; Convolutional neural network; Filter (signal processing); FLOPS,0.4
W4200570922,Artificial intelligence: a systematic review of methods and applications in hospitality and tourism,"Purpose Several review articles have been published within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) literature that have explored a range of applications within the tourism and hospitality sectors. However, how efficiently the applied AI methods and algorithms have performed with respect to the type of applications and the multimodal sets of data domains have not yet been reviewed. Therefore, this paper aims to review and analyse the established AI methods in hospitality/tourism, ranging from data modelling for demand forecasting, tourism destination and behaviour pattern to enhanced customer service and experience. Design/methodology/approach The approach was to systematically review the relationship between AI methods and hospitality/tourism through a comprehensive literature review of papers published between 2010 and 2021. In total, 146 articles were identified and then critically analysed through content analysis into themes, including “AI methods” and “AI applications”. Findings The review discovered new knowledge in identifying AI methods concerning the settings and available multimodal data sets in hospitality and tourism. Moreover, AI applications fostering the tourism/hospitality industries were identified. It also proposes novel personalised AI modelling development for smart tourism platforms to precisely predict tourism choice behaviour patterns. Practical implications This review paper offers researchers and practitioners a broad understanding of the proper selection of AI methods that can potentially improve decision-making and decision-support in the tourism/hospitality industries.

W4294839477,"Explainable, trustworthy, and ethical machine learning for healthcare: A survey","With the advent of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) empowered applications for critical applications like healthcare, the questions about liability, trust, and interpretability of their outputs are raising. The black-box nature of various DL models is a roadblock to clinical utilization. Therefore, to gain the trust of clinicians and patients, we need to provide explanations about the decisions of models. With the promise of enhancing the trust and transparency of black-box models, researchers are in the phase of maturing the field of eXplainable ML (XML). In this paper, we provided a comprehensive review of explainable and interpretable ML techniques for various healthcare applications. Along with highlighting security, safety, and robustness challenges that hinder the trustworthiness of ML, we also discussed the ethical issues arising because of the use of ML/DL for healthcare. We also describe how explainable and trustworthy ML can resolve all these ethical problems.

W3088512781,Transforming knowledge systems for life on Earth: Visions of future systems and how to get there,"Formalised knowledge systems, including universities and research institutes, are important for contemporary societies. They are, however, also arguably failing humanity when their impact is measured against the level of progress being made in stimulating the societal changes needed to address challenges like climate change. In this research we used a novel futures-oriented and participatory approach that asked what future envisioned knowledge systems might need to look like and how we might get there. Findings suggest that envisioned future systems will need to be much more collaborative, open, diverse, egalitarian, and able to work with values and systemic issues. They will also need to go beyond producing knowledge about our world to generating wisdom about how to act within it. To get to envisioned systems we will need to rapidly scale methodological innovations, connect innovators, and creatively accelerate learning about working with intractable challenges. We will also need to create new funding schemes, a global knowledge commons, and challenge deeply held assumptions. To genuinely be a creative force in supporting longevity of human and non-human life on our planet, the shift in knowledge systems will probably need to be at the scale of the enlightenment and speed of the scientific and technological revolution accompanying the second World War.

W3188786639,Investigating the mediating role of visitor satisfaction in the relationship between memorable tourism experiences and behavioral intentions in heritage tourism context,"Purpose This paper aims to investigate the interplay of memorable tourism experiences (MTE) dimensions in driving behavioral intentions of heritage tourists through the mediating role of satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach Empirical data were collected from tourists in the heritage city of Kashan, Iran. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) were applied to analyze the data. Findings The results of PLS-SEM showed that three dimensions of MTE as follows: local culture, involvement and knowledge, significantly directly or indirectly influence tourists’ behavioral intention toward a destination. However, the results of fsQCA identified greater heterogeneity among the respondents by highlighting the positive effects of hedonism and novelty on satisfaction and revisit and word-of-mouth intentions. Originality/value This study enriches the empirical evidence on MTE by constructing a composite picture of the memorability of tourists’ experiences within a heritage tourism context. This study is one of the first to investigate the effects of dimensions of MTE on behavioral intentions using both symmetric (PLS-SEM) and asymmetric approaches to identify the more significant dimensions of MTE, as well as sufficient combinations of dimensions to predict behavioral intentions.",2021-08-11,2021,S.

W4378373337,Boosting the Development of Hard Carbon for Sodium‐Ion Batteries: Strategies to Optimize the Initial Coulombic Efficiency,"Abstract Given the merits of affordable cost, superior low‐temperature performance, and advanced safe properties, sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have exhibited great development potential in large scale energy storage applications. Among various emerging carbonaceous anode materials applied for SIBs, hard carbon (HC) has recently gained significant attention regarding their relatively low cost, wide availability, and optimal overall performance. However, the insufficient initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of HC is the main bottlenecks, which is inevitably hindering their further commercial applications. Herein, an in‐depth holistic exposition about the reasons causing the unsatisfied ICE and the recent advances on effective improvement strategies are comprehensively summarized in this review, which have been divided into two aspects including the intrinsic property (degree of graphitization, pore structure, defect, et al.) and the extrinsic factor (electrolyte, electrode materials, et al.). In addition, future prospects and perspectives on HC to enable practical application in SIBs are also briefly outlined.",2023-05-26,2023,Yunrui Yang; Chun Wu; Xiang‐Xi He; Jiahua Zhao; Zhuo Yang,University of Wollongong,Advanced Functional Materials,232,https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202302277,AI_Machine_Learning,Faraday efficiency; Materials science; Boosting (machine learning); Nanotechnology; Anode,0.567
W4379382506,Self-Supervised Learning for Recommender Systems: A Survey,"In recent years, neural architecture-based recommender systems have achieved tremendous success, but they still fall short of expectation when dealing with highly sparse data. Self-supervised learning (SSL), as an emerging technique for learning from unlabeled data, has attracted considerable attention as a potential solution to this issue. This survey paper presents a systematic and timely review of research efforts on self-supervised recommendation (SSR). Specifically, we propose an exclusive definition of SSR, on top of which we develop a comprehensive taxonomy to divide existing SSR methods into four categories: contrastive, generative, predictive, and hybrid. For each category, we elucidate its concept and formulation, the involved methods, as well as its pros and cons. Furthermore, to facilitate empirical comparison, we release an open-source library SELFRec ( <uri xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">https://github.com/Coder-Yu/SELFRec</uri> ), which incorporates a wide range of SSR models and benchmark datasets.

W3013886221,Sensor data quality: a systematic review,"Abstract Sensor data quality plays a vital role in Internet of Things (IoT) applications as they are rendered useless if the data quality is bad. This systematic review aims to provide an introduction and guide for researchers who are interested in quality-related issues of physical sensor data. The process and results of the systematic review are presented which aims to answer the following research questions: what are the different types of physical sensor data errors, how to quantify or detect those errors, how to correct them and what domains are the solutions in. Out of 6970 literatures obtained from three databases (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect) using the search string refined via topic modelling, 57 publications were selected and examined. Results show that the different types of sensor data errors addressed by those papers are mostly missing data and faults e.g. outliers, bias and drift. The most common solutions for error detection are based on principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural network (ANN) which accounts for about 40% of all error detection papers found in the study. Similarly, for fault correction, PCA and ANN are among the most common, along with Bayesian Networks. Missing values on the other hand, are mostly imputed using Association Rule Mining. Other techniques include hybrid solutions that combine several data science methods to detect and correct the errors. Through this systematic review, it is found that the methods proposed to solve physical sensor data errors cannot be directly compared due to the non-uniform evaluation process and the high use of non-publicly available datasets. Bayesian data analysis done on the 57 selected publications also suggests that publications using publicly available datasets for method evaluation have higher citation rates.",2020-02-11,2020,Hui Yie Teh; Andreas W.

W3024560045,Foundations and Modeling of Dynamic Networks Using Dynamic Graph Neural Networks: A Survey,"Dynamic networks are used in a wide range of fields, including social network analysis, recommender systems, and epidemiology. Representing complex networks as structures changing over time allow network models to leverage not only structural but also temporal patterns. However, as dynamic network literature stems from diverse fields and makes use of inconsistent terminology, it is challenging to navigate. Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained a lot of attention in recent years for their ability to perform well on a range of network science tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite the popularity of graph neural networks and the proven benefits of dynamic network models, there has been little focus on graph neural networks for dynamic networks. To address the challenges resulting from the fact that this research crosses diverse fields as well as to survey dynamic graph neural networks, this work is split into two main parts. First, to address the ambiguity of the dynamic network terminology we establish a foundation of dynamic networks with consistent, detailed terminology and notation. Second, we present a comprehensive survey of dynamic graph neural network models using the proposed terminology",2021-01-01,2021,Joakim Skarding; Bogdan Gabryś; Katarzyna Musiał,University of Technology Sydney,IEEE Access,230,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3082932,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Terminology; Dynamic network analysis; Artificial neural network; Leverage (statistics),0.417
W3091074232,Attribute-Based Encryption With Parallel Outsourced Decryption for Edge Intelligent IoV,"Edge intelligence is an emerging concept referring to processes in which data are collected and analyzed and insights are delivered close to where the data are captured in a network using a selection of advanced intelligent technologies. As a promising solution to solve the problems of insufficient computing capacity and transmission latency, the edge intelligence-empowered Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is being widely investigated in both academia and industry. However, data sharing security in edge intelligent IoV is a challenge that should be solved with priority. Although attribute-based encryption (ABE) is capable of addressing this challenge, many time-consuming modular exponential operations and bilinear pair operations as well as serial computing cause ABE to have a slow decryption speed. Consequently, it cannot address the response time requirement of edge intelligent IoV. Given this problem, an ABE model with parallel outsourced decryption for edge intelligent IoV, called ABEM-POD, is proposed. It includes a generic parallel outsourced decryption method for ABE based on Spark and MapReduce. This method is applicable to all ABE schemes with a tree access structure and can be applied to edge intelligent IoV. Any ABE scheme based on the proposed model not only supports parallel outsourced decryption but also has the same security as the original scheme. In this paper, ABEM-POD has been applied to three representative ABE schemes, and the experiments show that the proposed ABEM-POD is efficient and easy to use. This approach can significantly improve the speed of outsourced decryption to address the response time requirement for edge intelligent IoV.",2020-09-29,2020,Chaosheng Feng; Keping Yu; Moayad Aloqaily; Mamoun Alazab; Zhihan Lv,Charles Darwin University,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,230,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2020.3027568,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Encryption; Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution; Attribute-based encryption; Distributed computing,0.283

W3175613352,Contrastive Learning based Hybrid Networks for Long-Tailed Image Classification,"Learning discriminative image representations plays a vital role in long-tailed image classification because it can ease the classifier learning in imbalanced cases. Given the promising performance contrastive learning has shown recently in representation learning, in this work, we explore effective supervised contrastive learning strategies and tailor them to learn better image representations from imbalanced data in order to boost the classification accuracy thereon. Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid network structure being composed of a supervised contrastive loss to learn image representations and a cross-entropy loss to learn classifiers, where the learning is progressively transited from feature learning to the classifier learning to embody the idea that better features make better classifiers. We explore two variants of contrastive loss for feature learning, which vary in the forms but share a common idea of pulling the samples from the same class together in the normalized embedding space and pushing the samples from different classes apart. One of them is the recently proposed supervised contrastive (SC) loss, which is designed on top of the state-of-the-art unsupervised contrastive loss by incorporating positive samples from the same class. The other is a prototypical supervised contrastive (PSC) learning strategy which addresses the intensive memory consumption in standard SC loss and thus shows more promise under limited memory budget. Extensive experiments on three long-tailed classification datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed contrastive learning based hybrid networks in long-tailed classification.",2021-06-01,2021,Peng Wang; Kai Han; Xiu-Shen Wei; Lei Zhang; Lei Wang,University of Wollongong,2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),230,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr46437.2021.00100,AI_Machine_Learning,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Feature learning; Discriminative model; Pattern recognition (psychology),0.417
W3090417167,Portable Food‐Freshness Prediction Platform Based on Colorimetric Barcode Combinatorics and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Abstract Artificial scent screening systems (known as electronic noses, E‐noses) have been researched extensively. A portable, automatic, and accurate, real‐time E‐nose requires both robust cross‐reactive sensing and fingerprint pattern recognition. Few E‐noses have been commercialized because they suffer from either sensing or pattern‐recognition issues. Here, cross‐reactive colorimetric barcode combinatorics and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are combined to form a system for monitoring meat freshness that concurrently provides scent fingerprint and fingerprint recognition. The barcodes—comprising 20 different types of porous nanocomposites of chitosan, dye, and cellulose acetate—form scent fingerprints that are identifiable by DCNN. A fully supervised DCNN trained using 3475 labeled barcode images predicts meat freshness with an overall accuracy of 98.5%. Incorporating DCNN into a smartphone application forms a simple platform for rapid barcode scanning and identification of food freshness in real time. The system is fast, accurate, and non‐destructive, enabling consumers and all stakeholders in the food supply chain to monitor food freshness.",2020-10-01,2020,Lingling Guo; Ting Wang; Zhonghua Wu; Jianwu Wang; Ming Wang,Monash University,Advanced Materials,229,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202004805,AI_Machine_Learning,Barcode; Electronic nose; Fingerprint (computing); Convolutional neural network; Pattern recognition (psychology),0.55

We systematically reviewed the effects of video on learning in higher education. We searched five databases using 27 keywords to find randomized trials that measured the learning effects of video among college students. We conducted full-text screening, data extraction, and risk of bias in duplicate. We calculated pooled effect sizes using multilevel random-effects meta-analysis. Searches retrieved 9,677 unique records. After screening 329 full texts, 105 met inclusion criteria, with a pooled sample of 7,776 students. Swapping video for existing teaching methods led to small improvements in student learning (g = 0.28). Adding video to existing teaching led to strong learning benefits (g = 0.80).

W4307561542,Knowledge Tracing: A Survey,"Humans’ ability to transfer knowledge through teaching is one of the essential aspects for human intelligence. A human teacher can track the knowledge of students to customize the teaching on students’ needs. With the rise of online education platforms, there is a similar need for machines to track the knowledge of students and tailor their learning experience. This is known as the Knowledge Tracing (KT) problem in the literature. Effectively solving the KT problem would unlock the potential of computer-aided education applications such as intelligent tutoring systems, curriculum learning, and learning materials’ recommendation. Moreover, from a more general viewpoint, a student may represent any kind of intelligent agents including both human and artificial agents. Thus, the potential of KT can be extended to any machine teaching application scenarios which seek for customizing the learning experience for a student agent (i.e., a machine learning model). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey for the KT literature. We cover a broad range of methods starting from the early attempts to the recent state-of-the-art methods using deep learning, while highlighting the theoretical aspects of models and the characteristics of benchmark datasets. Besides these, we shed light on key modelling differences between closely related methods and summarize them in an easy-to-understand format.

W3002699777,Ecosystems monitoring powered by environmental genomics: A review of current strategies with an implementation roadmap,"Abstract A decade after environmental scientists integrated high‐throughput sequencing technologies in their toolbox, the genomics‐based monitoring of anthropogenic impacts on the biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems is yet to be implemented by regulatory frameworks. Despite the broadly acknowledged potential of environmental genomics to this end, technical limitations and conceptual issues still stand in the way of its broad application by end‐users. In addition, the multiplicity of potential implementation strategies may contribute to a perception that the routine application of this methodology is premature or “in development”, hence restraining regulators from binding these tools into legal frameworks. Here, we review recent implementations of environmental genomics‐based methods, applied to the biomonitoring of ecosystems. By taking a general overview, without narrowing our perspective to particular habitats or groups of organisms, this paper aims to compare, review and discuss the strengths and limitations of four general implementation strategies of environmental genomics for monitoring: (a) Taxonomy‐based analyses focused on identification of known bioindicators or described taxa; (b) De novo bioindicator analyses; (c) Structural community metrics including inferred ecological networks; and (d) Functional community metrics (metagenomics or metatranscriptomics). We emphasise the utility of the three latter strategies to integrate meiofauna and microorganisms that are not traditionally utilised in biomonitoring because of difficult taxonomic identification. Finally, we propose a roadmap for the implementation of environmental genomics into routine monitoring programmes that leverage recent analytical advancements, while pointing out current limitations and future research needs.",2020-05-16,2020,Tristan Cordier; Laura Alonso‐Sáez; Laure Apothéloz‐Perret‐Gentil; Eva Aylagas; David A.

W4308657560,Applications of optical microcombs,"Optical microcombs represent a new paradigm for generating laser frequency combs based on compact chip-scale devices, which have underpinned many modern technological advances for both fundamental science and industrial applications. Along with the surge in activity related to optical micro-combs in the past decade, their applications have also experienced rapid progress, not only in traditional fields such as frequency synthesis, signal processing, and optical communications, but also in new interdisciplinary fields spanning the frontiers of light detection and ranging (LiDAR), astronomical detection, neuromorphic computing, and quantum optics. This paper reviews the applications of optical microcombs. First, an overview of the devices and methods for generating optical microcombs is provided, which are categorized into material platforms, device architectures, soliton classes, and driving mechanisms. Second, the broad applications of optical microcombs are systematically reviewed, which are categorized into microwave photonics, optical communications, precision measurements, neuromorphic computing, and quantum optics. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives are discussed.",2022-11-09,2022,Yang Sun; Jiayang Wu; Mengxi Tan; Xingyuan Xu; Yang Li,Swinburne University of Technology,Advances in Optics and Photonics,228,https://doi.org/10.1364/aop.470264,AI_Machine_Learning,Photonics; Neuromorphic engineering; Computer science; Optical physics; Signal processing,0.433
W3103796199,"Deep Learning for Community Detection: Progress, Challenges and Opportunities","As communities represent similar opinions, similar functions, similar purposes, etc., community detection is an important and extremely useful tool in both scientific inquiry and data analytics. However, the classic methods of community detection, such as spectral clustering and statistical inference, are falling by the wayside as deep learning techniques demonstrate an increasing capacity to handle high-dimensional graph data with impressive performance. Thus, a survey of current progress in community detection through deep learning is timely. Structured into three broad research streams in this domain – deep neural networks, deep graph embedding, and graph neural networks, this article summarizes the contributions of the various frameworks, models, and algorithms in each stream along with the current challenges that remain unsolved and the future research opportunities yet to be explored.",2020-07-01,2020,Fanzhen Liu; Shan Xue; Jia Wu; Chuan Zhou; Wenbin Hu,Macquarie University,,227,https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2020/693,AI_Machine_Learning,Deep learning; Computer science; Data science; Inference; Artificial intelligence,0.55
W3014339000,Detecting Code Clones with Graph Neural Network and Flow-Augmented Abstract Syntax Tree,"Code clones are semantically similar code fragments pairs that are syntactically similar or different. Detection of code clones can help to reduce the cost of software maintenance and prevent bugs. Numerous approaches of detecting code clones have been proposed previously, but most of them focus on detecting syntactic clones and do not work well on semantic clones with different syntactic features. To detect semantic clones, researchers have tried to adopt deep learning for code clone detection to automatically learn latent semantic features from data. Especially, to leverage grammar information, several approaches used abstract syntax trees (AST) as input and achieved significant progress on code clone benchmarks in various programming languages. However, these AST-based approaches still can not fully leverage the structural information of code fragments, especially semantic information such as control flow and data flow. To leverage control and data flow information, in this paper, we build a graph representation of programs called flow-augmented abstract syntax tree (FA-AST). We construct FA-AST by augmenting original ASTs with explicit control and data flow edges. Then we apply two different types of graph neural networks (GNN) on FA-AST to measure the similarity of code pairs. As far as we have concerned, we are the first to apply graph neural networks on the domain of code clone detection. We apply our FA-AST and graph neural networks on two Java datasets: Google Code Jam and BigCloneBench. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on both Google Code Jam and BigCloneBench tasks.",2020-02-01,2020,Wenhan Wang; Ge Li; Bo Ma; Xin Xia; Zhi Jin,Monash University,,226,https://doi.org/10.1109/saner48275.2020.9054857,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Abstract syntax tree; Leverage (statistics); Programming language; Control flow,0.417
W3148908072,Novel Transfer Learning Approach for Medical Imaging with Limited Labeled Data,"Deep learning requires a large amount of data to perform well. However, the field of medical image analysis suffers from a lack of sufficient data for training deep learning models. Moreover, medical images require manual labeling, usually provided by human annotators coming from various backgrounds. More importantly, the annotation process is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. Transfer learning was introduced to reduce the need for the annotation process by transferring the deep learning models with knowledge from a previous task and then by fine-tuning them on a relatively small dataset of the current task. Most of the methods of medical image classification employ transfer learning from pretrained models, e.g., ImageNet, which has been proven to be ineffective. This is due to the mismatch in learned features between the natural image, e.g., ImageNet, and medical images. Additionally, it results in the utilization of deeply elaborated models. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach to overcome the previous drawbacks by means of training the deep learning model on large unlabeled medical image datasets and by next transferring the knowledge to train the deep learning model on the small amount of labeled medical images. Additionally, we propose a new deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model that combines recent advancements in the field. We conducted several experiments on two challenging medical imaging scenarios dealing with skin and breast cancer classification tasks. According to the reported results, it has been empirically proven that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of both classification scenarios. In terms of skin cancer, the proposed model achieved an F1-score value of 89.09% when trained from scratch and 98.53% with the proposed approach. Secondly, it achieved an accuracy value of 85.29% and 97.51%, respectively, when trained from scratch and using the proposed approach in the case of the breast cancer scenario. Finally, we concluded that our method can possibly be applied to many medical imaging problems in which a substantial amount of unlabeled image data is available and the labeled image data is limited. Moreover, it can be utilized to improve the performance of medical imaging tasks in the same domain. To do so, we used the pretrained skin cancer model to train on feet skin to classify them into two classes—either normal or abnormal (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)). It achieved an F1-score value of 86.0% when trained from scratch, 96.25% using transfer learning, and 99.25% using double-transfer learning.",2021-03-30,2021,Laith Alzubaidi; Muthana Al‐Amidie; Ahmed Al‐Asadi; Amjad J.

W4240178698,The ARRIVE guidelines 2.0: updated guidelines for reporting animal researchThe ARRIVE guidelines 2.0: updated guidelines for reporting animal research,"Reproducible science requires transparent reporting. The ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) were originally developed in 2010 to improve the reporting of animal research. They consist of a checklist of information to include in publications describing in vivo experiments to enable others to scrutinise the work adequately, evaluate its methodological rigour and reproduce the methods and results. Despite considerable levels of endorsement by funders and journals over the years, adherence to the guidelines has been inconsistent, and the anticipated improvements in the quality of reporting in animal research publications have not been achieved. Here, we introduce ARRIVE 2.0. The guidelines have been updated and information reorganised to facilitate their use in practice. We used a Delphi exercise to prioritise and divide the items of the guidelines into two sets, the 'ARRIVE Essential 10', which constitutes the minimum requirement, and the 'Recommended Set', which describes the research context. This division facilitates improved reporting of animal research by supporting a stepwise approach to implementation. This helps journal editors and reviewers verify that the most important items are being reported in manuscripts. We have also developed the accompanying Explanation and Elaboration document, which serves (1) to explain the rationale behind each item in the guidelines, (2) to clarify key concepts and (3) to provide illustrative examples. We aim, through these changes, to help ensure that researchers, reviewers and journal editors are better equipped to improve the rigour and transparency of the scientific process and thus reproducibility.",2020-07-01,2020,Nathalie Percie du Sert; Viki Hurst; Amrita Ahluwalia; Sabina Alam; Marc T.

W4310852955,Federated learning enables big data for rare cancer boundary detection,"Although machine learning (ML) has shown promise in numerous domains, there are concerns about generalizability to out-of-sample data. This is currently addressed by centrally sharing ample, and importantly diverse, data from multiple sites. However, such centralization is challenging to scale (or even not feasible) due to various limitations. Federated ML (FL) provides an alternative to train accurate and generalizable ML models, by only sharing numerical model updates. Here we present findings from the largest FL study to-date, involving data from 71 healthcare institutions across 6 continents, to generate an automatic tumor boundary detector for the rare disease of glioblastoma, utilizing the largest dataset of such patients ever used in the literature (25,256 MRI scans from 6,314 patients). We demonstrate a 33% improvement over a publicly trained model to delineate the surgically targetable tumor, and 23% improvement over the tumor's entire extent. We anticipate our study to: 1) enable more studies in healthcare informed by large and diverse data, ensuring meaningful results for rare diseases and underrepresented populations, 2) facilitate further quantitative analyses for glioblastoma via performance optimization of our consensus model for eventual public release, and 3) demonstrate the effectiveness of FL at such scale and task complexity as a paradigm shift for multi-site collaborations, alleviating the need for data sharing.",2022-12-05,2022,Sarthak Pati; Ujjwal Baid; Brandon Edwards; Micah Sheller; Shih‐Han Wang,Flinders University,Nature Communications,226,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33407-5,AI_Machine_Learning,Generalizability theory; Computer science; Glioblastoma; Machine learning; Data sharing,0.55
W3084035636,Brain States and Transitions: Insights from Computational Neuroscience,"Within the field of computational neuroscience there are great expectations of finding new ways to rebalance the complex dynamic system of the human brain through controlled pharmacological or electromagnetic perturbation. Yet many obstacles remain between the ability to accurately predict how and where best to perturb to force a transition from one brain state to another. The foremost challenge is a commonly agreed definition of a given brain state. Recent progress in computational neuroscience has made it possible to robustly define brain states and force transitions between them. Here, we review the state of the art and propose a framework for determining the functional hierarchical organization describing any given brain state. We describe the latest advances in creating sophisticated whole-brain computational models with interacting neuronal and neurotransmitter systems that can be studied fully in silico to predict and design novel pharmacological and electromagnetic interventions to rebalance them in disease.",2020-09-01,2020,Morten L.

W3215023725,GMFlow: Learning Optical Flow via Global Matching,"Learning-based optical flow estimation has been dominated with the pipeline of cost volume with convolutions for flow regression, which is inherently limited to local correlations and thus is hard to address the long-standing challenge of large displacements. To alleviate this, the state-of-the-art framework RAFT gradually improves its prediction quality by using a large number of iterative refinements, achieving remarkable performance but introducing linearly increasing inference time. To enable both high accuracy and efficiency, we completely revamp the dominant flow regression pipeline by reformulating optical flow as a global matching problem, which identifies the correspondences by directly comparing feature similarities. Specifically, we propose a GMFlow framework, which consists of three main components: a customized Transformer for feature enhancement, a correlation and softmax layer for global feature matching, and a self-attention layer for flow propagation. We further introduce a refinement step that reuses GMFlow at higher feature resolution for residual flow prediction. Our new framework outperforms 31-refinements RAFT on the challenging Sintel benchmark, while using only one refinement and running faster, suggesting a new paradigm for accurate and efficient optical flow estimation.

W3010095828,"Development and Reporting of Prediction Models: Guidance for Authors From Editors of Respiratory, Sleep, and Critical Care Journals","Prediction models aim to use available data to predict a health state or outcome that has not yet been observed. Prediction is primarily relevant to clinical practice, but is also used in research, and administration. While prediction modeling involves estimating the relationship between patient factors and outcomes, it is distinct from casual inference. Prediction modeling thus requires unique considerations for development, validation, and updating. This document represents an effort from editors at 31 respiratory, sleep, and critical care medicine journals to consolidate contemporary best practices and recommendations related to prediction study design, conduct, and reporting. Herein, we address issues commonly encountered in submissions to our various journals. Key topics include considerations for selecting predictor variables, operationalizing variables, dealing with missing data, the importance of appropriate validation, model performance measures and their interpretation, and good reporting practices. Supplemental discussion covers emerging topics such as model fairness, competing risks, pitfalls of “modifiable risk factors”, measurement error, and risk for bias. This guidance is not meant to be overly prescriptive; we acknowledge that every study is different, and no set of rules will fit all cases. Additional best practices can be found in the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines, to which we refer readers for further details.",2020-03-06,2020,Daniel E.

W3049258024,The Lancet Series call to action to reduce low value care for low back pain: an update,"The 2018 Lancet Low Back Pain Series, comprising 3 papers written by 31 authors from disparate disciplines and 12 different countries, raised unprecedented awareness of the rising global burden of low back pain partly attributable to poor quality health care.12,30,44 Many people with low back pain get the wrong care, causing harm to millions across the world and wasting valuable health care resources. Based upon an up-to-date, evidence-based synthesis, the series described current guideline recommended care of low back pain, and new strategies that show promise, but require further testing, to reduce low value care. We also proposed a series of actions needed to reverse the alarming global rise in low back pain disability. A better understanding of low back pain in different cultures and changes to the way care for low back pain is delivered and the way clinicians are reimbursed are key to reversing this problem. To reach all relevant stakeholders, we devised a well-planned and thorough media strategy to facilitate promotion of the series. This included not only Lancet staples such as a Lancet social media card, structured press release, and Lancet podcast distributed to about 2000 journalists but also email banners, country media focal points who could provide country-specific information, a set of global key messages that were modified for country-level use, a twitter hashtag of the series, #LowBackPain, and a schedule of suggested tweets to be used by authors over the 48 hours before and after the publication of the series. The series was also made free to download (see https://www.thelancet.com/ series/low-back-pain). The success of this approach is evident by the unprecedented media coverage it received with all 3 articles achieving Altmetric scores in the 99th percentile. There was media coverage in at least 17 countries including wall-to-wall coverage in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Denmark. Furthermore, interest in The Lancet Low Back Pain Series has persisted as evident by continued attention from major media outlets. For example, The Economist published an article entitled “Back pain is a massive problem which is badly treated” on 18 Jan 2020,17 accompanied by a “Leader” (editorial opinion) on the topic. This review, invited to coincide with a plenary at the 2020 World Congress on Pain, outlines and discusses some of the main messages from The Lancet Low Back Pain Series, with a focus on pertinent positive and negative developments since it was published.",2020-08-15,2020,Rachelle Buchbinder; Martin Underwood; Jan Hartvigsen; Christopher G.

W3116634773,Virtual and Augmented Reality Enhancements to Medical and Science Student Physiology and Anatomy Test Performance: A Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis,"Virtual and augmented reality have seen increasing employment for teaching within medical and health sciences programs. For disciplines such as physiology and anatomy, these technologies may disrupt the traditional modes of teaching and content delivery. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the impact of virtual reality or augmented reality on knowledge acquisition for students studying preclinical physiology and anatomy. The protocol was submitted to Prospero and literature search undertaken in PubMed, Embase, ERIC, and other databases. Citations were reviewed and articles published in full assessing learning or knowledge acquisition in preclinical physiology and anatomy from virtual or augmented reality were included. Of the 919 records found, 58 eligible articles were reviewed in full-text, with 8 studies meeting full eligibility requirements. There was no significant difference in knowledge scores from combining the eight studies (626 participants), with the pooled difference being a non-significant increase of 2.9 percentage points (95% CI [-2.9; 8.6]). For the four studies comparing virtual reality to traditional teaching, the pooled treatment effect difference was 5.8 percentage points (95% CI [-4.1; 15.7]). For the five studies comparing augmented reality to traditional teaching, the pooled treatment effect difference was 0.07 (95% CI [-7.0; 7.2]). Upon review of the literature, it is apparent that educators could benefit from adopting assessment processes that evaluate three-dimensional spatial understanding as a priority in physiology and anatomy. The overall evidence suggests that although test performance is not significantly enhanced with either mode, both virtual and augmented reality are viable alternatives to traditional methods of education in health sciences and medical courses.",2020-12-31,2020,Christian Moro; James Birt; Zane Štromberga; Charlotte Phelps; Justin Clark,Bond University,Anatomical Sciences Education,222,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2049,AI_Machine_Learning,Virtual reality; Test (biology); Augmented reality; MEDLINE; Meta-analysis,0.225
W3161976591,Two-Layer Federated Learning With Heterogeneous Model Aggregation for 6G Supported Internet of Vehicles,"The vision of the upcoming 6G technologies that have fast data rate, low latency, and ultra-dense network, draws great attentions to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication for intelligent transportation systems. There is an urgent need for distributed machine learning techniques that can take advantages of massive interconnected networks with explosive amount of heterogeneous data generated at the network edge. In this study, a two-layer federated learning model is proposed to take advantages of the distributed end-edge-cloud architecture typical in 6G environment, and to achieve a more efficient and more accurate learning while ensuring data privacy protection and reducing communication overheads. A novel multi-layer heterogeneous model selection and aggregation scheme is designed as a part of the federated learning process to better utilize the local and global contexts of individual vehicles and road side units (RSUs) in 6G supported vehicular networks. This context-aware distributed learning mechanism is then developed and applied to address intelligent object detection, which is one of the most critical challenges in modern intelligent transportation systems with autonomous vehicles. Evaluation results showed that the proposed method, which demonstrates a higher learning accuracy with better precision, recall and F1 score, outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under 6G network configuration by achieving faster convergence, and scales better with larger numbers of RSUs involved in the learning process.",2021-05-06,2021,Xiaokang Zhou; Wei Liang; Jinhua She; Zheng Yan; Kevin I‐Kai Wang,University of Auckland,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,222,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2021.3077893,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Cloud computing; Distributed computing; Intelligent transportation system; The Internet,0.85
W3034730770,Hierarchical Conditional Relation Networks for Video Question Answering,"Video question answering (VideoQA) is challenging as it requires modeling capacity to distill dynamic visual artifacts and distant relations and to associate them with linguistic concepts. We introduce a general-purpose reusable neural unit called Conditional Relation Network (CRN) that serves as a building block to construct more sophisticated structures for representation and reasoning over video. CRN takes as input an array of tensorial objects and a conditioning feature, and computes an array of encoded output objects. Model building becomes a simple exercise of replication, rearrangement and stacking of these reusable units for diverse modalities and contextual information. This design thus supports high-order relational and multi-step reasoning. The resulting architecture for VideoQA is a CRN hierarchy whose branches represent sub-videos or clips, all sharing the same question as the contextual condition.

W4200584507,"Cancer Incidence, Mortality, Years of Life Lost, Years Lived With Disability, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years for 29 Cancer Groups From 2010 to 2019","Importance The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 (GBD 2019) provided systematic estimates of incidence, morbidity, and mortality to inform local and international efforts toward reducing cancer burden. Objective To estimate cancer burden and trends globally for 204 countries and territories and by Sociodemographic Index (SDI) quintiles from 2010 to 2019. Evidence Review The GBD 2019 estimation methods were used to describe cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2019 and over the past decade. Estimates are also provided by quintiles of the SDI, a composite measure of educational attainment, income per capita, and total fertility rate for those younger than 25 years. Estimates include 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Findings In 2019, there were an estimated 23.6 million (95% UI, 22.2-24.9 million) new cancer cases (17.2 million when excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 10.0 million (95% UI, 9.36-10.6 million) cancer deaths globally, with an estimated 250 million (235-264 million) DALYs due to cancer. Since 2010, these represented a 26.3% (95% UI, 20.3%-32.3%) increase in new cases, a 20.9% (95% UI, 14.2%-27.6%) increase in deaths, and a 16.0% (95% UI, 9.3%-22.8%) increase in DALYs. Among 22 groups of diseases and injuries in the GBD 2019 study, cancer was second only to cardiovascular diseases for the number of deaths, years of life lost, and DALYs globally in 2019. Cancer burden differed across SDI quintiles. The proportion of years lived with disability that contributed to DALYs increased with SDI, ranging from 1.4% (1.1%-1.8%) in the low SDI quintile to 5.7% (4.2%-7.1%) in the high SDI quintile. While the high SDI quintile had the highest number of new cases in 2019, the middle SDI quintile had the highest number of cancer deaths and DALYs. From 2010 to 2019, the largest percentage increase in the numbers of cases and deaths occurred in the low and low-middle SDI quintiles. Conclusions and Relevance The results of this systematic analysis suggest that the global burden of cancer is substantial and growing, with burden differing by SDI. These results provide comprehensive and comparable estimates that can potentially inform efforts toward equitable cancer control around the world.",2021-12-30,2021,Jonathan Kocarnik; Kelly Compton; Frances Dean; Weijia Fu; Brian Gaw,Auckland University of Technology,JAMA Oncology,1527,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2021.6987,Defense_Security,Medicine; Cancer; Incidence (geometry); Cancer incidence; Gerontology,0.225
W3111021405,"Assessing the age specificity of infection fatality rates for COVID-19: systematic review, meta-analysis, and public policy implications","Abstract Determine age-specific infection fatality rates for COVID-19 to inform public health policies and communications that help protect vulnerable age groups. Studies of COVID-19 prevalence were collected by conducting an online search of published articles, preprints, and government reports that were publicly disseminated prior to 18 September 2020. The systematic review encompassed 113 studies, of which 27 studies (covering 34 geographical locations) satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Age-specific IFRs were computed using the prevalence data in conjunction with reported fatalities 4 weeks after the midpoint date of the study, reflecting typical lags in fatalities and reporting. Meta-regression procedures in Stata were used to analyze the infection fatality rate (IFR) by age. Our analysis finds a exponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19. The estimated age-specific IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. Moreover, our results indicate that about 90% of the variation in population IFR across geographical locations reflects differences in the age composition of the population and the extent to which relatively vulnerable age groups were exposed to the virus. These results indicate that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. Moreover, the overall IFR for COVID-19 should not be viewed as a fixed parameter but as intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. Consequently, public health measures to mitigate infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths.",2020-12-01,2020,Andrew Levin; William P.

W3047493740,The prevalence of mental illness in refugees and asylum seekers: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Globally, the number of refugees and asylum seekers has reached record highs. Past research in refugee mental health has reported wide variation in mental illness prevalence data, partially attributable to methodological limitations. This systematic review aims to summarise the current body of evidence for the prevalence of mental illness in global refugee populations and overcome methodological limitations of individual studies. Methods and findings A comprehensive search of electronic databases was undertaken from 1 January 2003 to 4 February 2020 (MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EBM Reviews, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, PILOTS, Web of Science). Quantitative studies were included if diagnosis of mental illness involved a clinical interview and use of a validated assessment measure and reported at least 50 participants. Study quality was assessed using a descriptive approach based on a template according to study design (modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale). Random-effects models, based on inverse variance weights, were conducted. Subgroup analyses were performed for sex, sample size, displacement duration, visa status, country of origin, current residence, type of interview (interpreter-assisted or native language), and diagnostic measure. The systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD) 42016046349. The search yielded a result of 21,842 records. Twenty-six studies, which included one randomised controlled trial and 25 observational studies, provided results for 5,143 adult refugees and asylum seekers. Studies were undertaken across 15 countries: Australia (652 refugees), Austria (150), China (65), Germany (1,104), Italy (297), Lebanon (646), Nepal (574), Norway (64), South Korea (200), Sweden (86), Switzerland (164), Turkey (238), Uganda (77), United Kingdom (420), and the United States of America (406). The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was 31.46% (95% CI 24.43–38.5), the prevalence of depression was 31.5% (95% CI 22.64–40.38), the prevalence of anxiety disorders was 11% (95% CI 6.75–15.43), and the prevalence of psychosis was 1.51% (95% CI 0.63–2.40). A limitation of the study is that substantial heterogeneity was present in the prevalence estimates of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and limited covariates were reported in the included studies. Conclusions This comprehensive review generates current prevalence estimates for not only PTSD but also depression, anxiety, and psychosis. Refugees and asylum seekers have high and persistent rates of PTSD and depression, and the results of this review highlight the need for ongoing, long-term mental health care beyond the initial period of resettlement.",2020-09-21,2020,Rebecca Blackmore; Jacqueline Boyle; Mina Fazel; Sanjeeva Ranasinha; Kylie M.

W3007596355,"Global, Regional and Country-Specific Burden of Ischaemic Stroke, Intracerebral Haemorrhage and Subarachnoid Haemorrhage: A Systematic Analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017","&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in globally and particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and this burden is increasing. The burden of stroke pathological subtypes varies in terms of incidence, disability and mortality. Previous Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Studies (GBD) reports did not provide separate global burden and trends estimates for haemorrhagic stroke by primary intracerebral haemorrhage (PICH) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aim:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; To summarise the GBD 2017 findings for the burden and 27-year trends for ischaemic stroke (IS), intracerebral haemorrhage and SAH by age, sex and country income level in 21 world regions and associated risk factors. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Data on stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) lost and the burden of IS, PICH and SAH were derived from all available datasets from the GBD 2017 studies. Data were analysed in terms of absolute numbers and age-standardised rates per 100,000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]), with estimates stratified by age, sex and economic development level by the World Bank classification. We also analysed changes in the patterns of incidence, mortality and DALYs estimates between 1990 and 2017. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; In 2017, there were 11.9 million incident (95% UI 11.1–12.8), 104.2 million prevalent (98.6–110.2), 6.2 million fatal (6.0–6.3) cases of stroke and 132.1 million stroke-related DALYs (126.5–137.4). Although stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality and DALY rates declined from 1990 to 2017, the absolute number of people who developed new stroke, died, survived or remained disabled from stroke has almost doubled. The bulk of stroke burden (80% all incident strokes, 77% all stroke survivors, 87% of all deaths from stroke and 89 of all stroke-related DALYs) in 2017 was in low- to middle-income countries. Globally in 2017, IS constituted 65%, PICH –26% and SAH –9% of all incident strokes. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Discussion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The latest GBD estimates of stroke burden in 195 countries supersede previous GBD stroke burden findings and provide most accurate data for stroke care planning and resource allocation globally, regionally and for 195 countries. Stroke remains the second leading cause of deaths and disability worldwide. The increased stroke burden continues to exacerbate a huge pressure on people affected by stroke, their families and societies. It is imperative to develop and implement more effective primary prevention strategies to reduce stroke burden and its impact.",2020-01-01,2020,Rita Krishnamurthi; Takayoshi Ikeda; Valery L.

W3081864036,Projecting the continental accumulation of alien species through to 2050,"Abstract Biological invasions have steadily increased over recent centuries. However, we still lack a clear expectation about future trends in alien species numbers. In particular, we do not know whether alien species will continue to accumulate in regional floras and faunas, or whether the pace of accumulation will decrease due to the depletion of native source pools. Here, we apply a new model to simulate future numbers of alien species based on estimated sizes of source pools and dynamics of historical invasions, assuming a continuation of processes in the future as observed in the past (a business‐as‐usual scenario). We first validated performance of different model versions by conducting a back‐casting approach, therefore fitting the model to alien species numbers until 1950 and validating predictions on trends from 1950 to 2005. In a second step, we selected the best performing model that provided the most robust predictions to project trajectories of alien species numbers until 2050. Altogether, this resulted in 3,790 stochastic simulation runs for 38 taxon–continent combinations. We provide the first quantitative projections of future trajectories of alien species numbers for seven major taxonomic groups in eight continents, accounting for variation in sampling intensity and uncertainty in projections. Overall, established alien species numbers per continent were predicted to increase from 2005 to 2050 by 36%. Particularly, strong increases were projected for Europe in absolute (+2,543 ± 237 alien species) and relative terms, followed by Temperate Asia (+1,597 ± 197), Northern America (1,484 ± 74) and Southern America (1,391 ± 258). Among individual taxonomic groups, especially strong increases were projected for invertebrates globally. Declining (but still positive) rates were projected only for Australasia. Our projections provide a first baseline for the assessment of future developments of biological invasions, which will help to inform policies to contain the spread of alien species.",2020-10-01,2020,Hanno Seebens; Sven Bacher; Tim M.

W3038412545,Genetic diversity targets and indicators in the CBD post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework must be improved,"The 196 parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) will soon agree to a post-2020 global framework for conserving the three elements of biodiversity (genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity) while ensuring sustainable development and benefit sharing. As the most significant global conservation policy mechanism, the new CBD framework has far-reaching consequences- it will guide conservation actions and reporting for each member country until 2050. In previous CBD strategies, as well as other major conservation policy mechanisms, targets and indicators for genetic diversity (variation at the DNA level within species, which facilitates species adaptation and ecosystem function) were undeveloped and focused on species of agricultural relevance. We assert that, to meet global conservation goals, genetic diversity within all species, not just domesticated species and their wild relatives, must be conserved and monitored using appropriate metrics. Building on suggestions in a recent Letter in Science (Laikre et al., 2020) we expand argumentation for three new, pragmatic genetic indicators and modifications to two current indicators for maintaining genetic diversity and adaptive capacity of all species, and provide guidance on their practical use. The indicators are: 1) the number of populations with effective population size above versus below 500, 2) the proportion of populations maintained within species, 3) the number of species and populations in which genetic diversity is monitored using DNA-based methods. We also present and discuss Goals and Action Targets for post-2020 biodiversity conservation which are connected to these indicators and underlying data. These pragmatic indicators and goals have utility beyond the CBD; they should benefit conservation and monitoring of genetic diversity via national and global policy for decades to come.",2020-07-02,2020,Sean Hoban; Michael W.

W4200535791,Online Health Information Seeking Behavior: A Systematic Review,"The last five years have seen a leap in the development of information technology and social media. Seeking health information online has become popular. It has been widely accepted that online health information seeking behavior has a positive impact on health information consumers. Due to its importance, online health information seeking behavior has been investigated from different aspects. However, there is lacking a systematic review that can integrate the findings of the most recent research work in online health information seeking, and provide guidance to governments, health organizations, and social media platforms on how to support and promote this seeking behavior, and improve the services of online health information access and provision. We therefore conduct this systematic review. The Google Scholar database was searched for existing research on online health information seeking behavior between 2016 and 2021 to obtain the most recent findings. Within the 97 papers searched, 20 met our inclusion criteria. Through a systematic review, this paper identifies general behavioral patterns, and influencing factors such as age, gender, income, employment status, literacy (or education) level, country of origin and places of residence, and caregiving role. Facilitators (i.e., the existence of online communities, the privacy feature, real-time interaction, and archived health information format), and barriers (i.e., low health literacy, limited accessibility and information retrieval skills, low reliable, deficient and elusive health information, platform censorship, and lack of misinformation checks) to online health information seeking behavior are also discovered.",2021-12-16,2021,Xiaoyun Jia; Yan Pang; Liangni Sally Liu,Massey University,Healthcare,344,https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9121740,Defense_Security,Misinformation; Information seeking; Information seeking behavior; Health literacy; Social media,0.3
W3085114106,Mental health in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional analyses from a community cohort study,"Objectives Previous pandemics have resulted in significant consequences for mental health. Here, we report the mental health sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic in a UK cohort and examine modifiable and non-modifiable explanatory factors associated with mental health outcomes. We focus on the first wave of data collection, which examined short-term consequences for mental health, as reported during the first 4–6 weeks of social distancing measures being introduced. Design Cross-sectional online survey. Setting Community cohort study. Participants N=3097 adults aged ≥18 years were recruited through a mainstream and social media campaign between 3 April 2020 and 30 April 2020. The cohort was predominantly female (n=2618); mean age 44 years; 10% (n=296) from minority ethnic groups; 50% (n=1559) described themselves as key workers and 20% (n=649) identified as having clinical risk factors putting them at increased risk of COVID-19. Main outcome measures Depression, anxiety and stress scores. Results Mean scores for depression ( <m:math xmlns:m=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" overflow=""scroll""><m:mover accent=""true""><m:mrow><m:mi>x</m:mi></m:mrow><m:mo>-</m:mo></m:mover></m:math> =7.69, SD=6.0), stress ( <m:math xmlns:m=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" overflow=""scroll""><m:mover accent=""true""><m:mrow><m:mi>x</m:mi></m:mrow><m:mo>-</m:mo></m:mover></m:math> =6.48, SD=3.3) and anxiety ( <m:math xmlns:m=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" overflow=""scroll""><m:mover accent=""true""><m:mrow><m:mi>x</m:mi></m:mrow><m:mo>-</m:mo></m:mover></m:math> = 6.48, SD=3.3) significantly exceeded population norms (all p&lt;0.0001). Analysis of non-modifiable factors hypothesised to be associated with mental health outcomes indicated that being younger, female and in a recognised COVID-19 risk group were associated with increased stress, anxiety and depression, with the final multivariable models accounting for 7%–14% of variance. When adding modifiable factors, significant independent effects emerged for positive mood, perceived loneliness and worry about getting COVID-19 for all outcomes, with the final multivariable models accounting for 54%–57% of total variance. Conclusions Increased psychological morbidity was evident in this UK sample and found to be more common in younger people, women and in individuals who identified as being in recognised COVID-19 risk groups. Public health and mental health interventions able to ameliorate perceptions of risk of COVID-19, worry about COVID-19 loneliness and boost positive mood may be effective.",2020-09-01,2020,Ru Jia; Kieran Ayling; Trudie Chalder; Adam Massey; Elizabeth Broadbent,University of Auckland,BMJ Open,322,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040620,Defense_Security,Medicine; Mental health; Cohort; Cross-sectional study; Anxiety,0.15
W3044830147,Estimated global cancer incidence in the oldest adults in 2018 and projections to 2050,"Abstract Using GLOBOCAN estimates, we describe the estimated cancer incidence among adults aged 80 years or older at the regional and global level in 2018, reporting the number of new cancer cases, and the truncated age‐standardised incidence rates (per 100 000) for all cancer sites combined for this age group. We also presented the five most frequent cancers diagnosed by region and globally among females and males aged 65 to 79 years old and 80 years or older. We, finally, estimated the number of new cancer cases in 2050, the proportion of cases aged 80 years or older, and the proportional increase between 2018 and 2050 by region, by applying population projections to the 2018 incidence rates. In 2018, an estimated 2.3 million new cancer cases (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) were aged 80 years or older worldwide (13% of all cancer cases), with large variation in the profiles at regional levels. Globally, breast, lung and colon were the most common cancer sites diagnosed in the oldest females, while prostate, lung and colon were most frequent in the oldest males. In 2050, an estimated 6.9 million new cancers will be diagnosed in adults aged 80 years or older worldwide (20.5% of all cancer cases). Due to the complexity of cancer management in the oldest patients, the expected increase will challenge healthcare systems worldwide, posing a tangible economic and social impact on families and society.

W3215795378,PHANGS–ALMA: Arcsecond CO(2–1) Imaging of Nearby Star-forming Galaxies,"Abstract We present PHANGS–ALMA, the first survey to map CO J = 2 → 1 line emission at ∼1″ ∼100 pc spatial resolution from a representative sample of 90 nearby ( d ≲ 20 Mpc) galaxies that lie on or near the z = 0 “main sequence” of star-forming galaxies. CO line emission traces the bulk distribution of molecular gas, which is the cold, star-forming phase of the interstellar medium. At the resolution achieved by PHANGS–ALMA, each beam reaches the size of a typical individual giant molecular cloud, so that these data can be used to measure the demographics, life cycle, and physical state of molecular clouds across the population of galaxies where the majority of stars form at z = 0. This paper describes the scientific motivation and background for the survey, sample selection, global properties of the targets, Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations, and characteristics of the delivered data and derived data products. As the ALMA sample serves as the parent sample for parallel surveys with MUSE on the Very Large Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope, AstroSat, the Very Large Array, and other facilities, we include a detailed discussion of the sample selection. We detail the estimation of galaxy mass, size, star formation rate, CO luminosity, and other properties, compare estimates using different systems and provide best-estimate integrated measurements for each target. We also report the design and execution of the ALMA observations, which combine a Cycle 5 Large Program, a series of smaller programs, and archival observations. Finally, we present the first 1″ resolution atlas of CO emission from nearby galaxies and describe the properties and contents of the first PHANGS–ALMA public data release.",2021-11-24,2021,Adam K.

W3093574855,Extraordinary human energy consumption and resultant geological impacts beginning around 1950 CE initiated the proposed Anthropocene Epoch,"Abstract Growth in fundamental drivers—energy use, economic productivity and population—can provide quantitative indications of the proposed boundary between the Holocene Epoch and the Anthropocene. Human energy expenditure in the Anthropocene, ~22 zetajoules (ZJ), exceeds that across the prior 11,700 years of the Holocene (~14.6 ZJ), largely through combustion of fossil fuels. The global warming effect during the Anthropocene is more than an order of magnitude greater still. Global human population, their productivity and energy consumption, and most changes impacting the global environment, are highly correlated. This extraordinary outburst of consumption and productivity demonstrates how the Earth System has departed from its Holocene state since ~1950 CE, forcing abrupt physical, chemical and biological changes to the Earth’s stratigraphic record that can be used to justify the proposal for naming a new epoch—the Anthropocene.",2020-10-16,2020,James P.

W3202101187,Scientists’ warning – The outstanding biodiversity of islands is in peril,"Despite islands contributing only 6.7% of land surface area, they harbor ~20% of the Earth’s biodiversity, but unfortunately also ~50% of the threatened species and 75% of the known extinctions since the European expansion around the globe. Due to their geological and geographic history and characteristics, islands act simultaneously as cradles of evolutionary diversity and museums of formerly widespread lineages—elements that permit islands to achieve an outstanding endemicity. Nevertheless, the majority of these endemic species are inherently vulnerable due to genetic and demographic factors linked with the way islands are colonized. Here, we stress the great variation of islands in their physical geography (area, isolation, altitude, latitude) and history (age, human colonization, human density). We provide examples of some of the most species rich and iconic insular radiations. Next, we analyze the natural vulnerability of the insular biota, linked to genetic and demographic factors as a result of founder events as well as the typically small population sizes of many island species. We note that, whereas evolution toward island syndromes (including size shifts, derived insular woodiness, altered dispersal ability, loss of defense traits, reduction in clutch size) might have improved the ability of species to thrive under natural conditions on islands, it has simultaneously made island biota disproportionately vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures such as habitat loss, overexploitation, invasive species, and climate change. This has led to the documented extinction of at least 800 insular species in the past 500 years, in addition to the many that had already gone extinct following the arrival of first human colonists on islands in prehistoric times. Finally, we summarize current scientific knowledge on the ongoing biodiversity loss on islands worldwide and express our serious concern that the current trajectory will continue to decimate the unique and irreplaceable natural heritage of the world’s islands. We conclude that drastic actions are urgently needed to bend the curve of the alarming rates of island biodiversity loss.",2021-09-28,2021,José María Fernández‐Palacios; Holger Kreft; Severin D. H.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic literature search of relevant databases to identify studies reporting on prevalence, hospitalisations, and deaths from COVID-19 by race groups between 01 January 2020 -15 April 2021.We grouped race categories into Blacks, Hispanics, Whites and Others.Random effects model using the method of DerSimonian and Laird were fitted, and forest plot with respective ratio estimates and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each race category, and subgroup meta-regression analyses and the overall pooled ratio estimates for prevalence, hospitalisation and mortality rate were presented. ResultsBlacks experienced significantly higher burden of COVID-19: prevalence ratio 1.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.59-1.99),hospitalisation ratio 1.87 (95% CI = 1.69-2.04),mortality ratio 1.68 (95% CI = 1.52-1.83),compared to Whites: prevalence ratio 0.70 (95% CI = 0.0.64-0.77),hospitalisation ratio 0.74 (95% CI = 0.65-0.82),mortality ratio 0.82 (95% CI = 0.78-0.87).Also, Hispanics experienced a higher burden: prevalence ratio 1.78 (95% CI = 1.63-1.94),hospitalisation ratio 1.32 (95% CI = 1.08-1.55),mortality ratio 0.94 (95% CI = 0.84-1.04)compared to Whites.A higher burden was also observed for Other race groups: prevalence ratio 1.43 (95% CI = 1.19-1.67),hospitalisation ratio 1.12 (95% CI = 0.89-1.35),mortality ratio 1.06 (95% CI = 0.89-1.23)compared to Whites.The disproportionate burden among Blacks and Hispanics remained following correction for publication bias.Conclusions Blacks and Hispanics have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19.This is deeply concerning and highlights the systemically entrenched disadvantages (social, economic, and political) experienced by racial minorities in western countries; and this study underscores the need to address inequities in these communities to improve overall health outcomes.",2021-06-26,2021,William Mude; Victor M.

Due to the lack of vaccines and definitive treatment, preventive behaviors are the only way to overcome the disease. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the preventive behaviors from the disease based on constructs of the health belief model. Methods In the present cross-sectional study during March 11–16, 2020, 750 individuals in Golestan Province of Iran were included in the study using the convenience sampling and they completed the questionnaires through cyberspace. Factor scores were calculated using the confirmatory factor analysis. The effects of different factors were separately investigated using the univariate analyses, including students sample t -test, ANOVA, and simple linear regression. Finally, the effective factors were examined by the multiple regression analysis at a significant level of 0.05 and through Mplus 7 and SPSS 16. Results The participants’ mean age was 33.9 ± 9.45 years; and 57.1% of them had associate and bachelor's degrees. Multiple regression indicated that the mean score of preventive behavior from COVID-19 was higher in females than males, and greater in urban dwellers than rural dwellers. Furthermore, one unit increase in the standard deviation of factor scores of self-efficacy and perceived benefits increased the scores of preventive behavior from COVID-19 by 0.22 and 0.17 units respectively. On the contrary, one unit increase in the standard deviation of factor score of perceived barriers and fatalistic beliefs decreased the scores of the preventive behavior from COVID-19 by 0.36 and 0.19 units respectively. Conclusions Results of the present study indicated that female gender, perceived barriers, perceived self-efficacy, fatalistic beliefs, perceived interests, and living in city had the greatest preventive behaviors from COVID-19 respectively.

W4303184554,"Plant growth-promoting microorganisms as biocontrol agents of plant diseases: Mechanisms, challenges and future perspectives","Plant diseases and pests are risk factors that threaten global food security. Excessive chemical pesticide applications are commonly used to reduce the effects of plant diseases caused by bacterial and fungal pathogens. A major concern, as we strive toward more sustainable agriculture, is to increase crop yields for the increasing population. Microbial biological control agents (MBCAs) have proved their efficacy to be a green strategy to manage plant diseases, stimulate plant growth and performance, and increase yield. Besides their role in growth enhancement, plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria/fungi (PGPR/PGPF) could suppress plant diseases by producing inhibitory chemicals and inducing immune responses in plants against phytopathogens. As biofertilizers and biopesticides, PGPR and PGPF are considered as feasible, attractive economic approach for sustainable agriculture; thus, resulting in a “win-win” situation. Several PGPR and PGPF strains have been identified as effective BCAs under environmentally controlled conditions. In general, any MBCA must overcome certain challenges before it can be registered or widely utilized to control diseases/pests. Successful MBCAs offer a practical solution to improve greenhouse crop performance with reduced fertilizer inputs and chemical pesticide applications. This current review aims to fill the gap in the current knowledge of plant growth-promoting microorganisms (PGPM), provide attention about the scientific basis for policy development, and recommend further research related to the applications of PGPM used for commercial purposes.",2022-10-06,2022,Mohamed T.

W3004578855,Short term association between ozone and mortality: global two stage time series study in 406 locations in 20 countries,"Abstract Objective To assess short term mortality risks and excess mortality associated with exposure to ozone in several cities worldwide. Design Two stage time series analysis. Setting 406 cities in 20 countries, with overlapping periods between 1985 and 2015, collected from the database of Multi-City Multi-Country Collaborative Research Network. Population Deaths for all causes or for external causes only registered in each city within the study period . Main outcome measures Daily total mortality (all or non-external causes only). Results A total of 45 165 171 deaths were analysed in the 406 cities. On average, a 10 µg/m 3 increase in ozone during the current and previous day was associated with an overall relative risk of mortality of 1.0018 (95% confidence interval 1.0012 to 1.0024). Some heterogeneity was found across countries, with estimates ranging from greater than 1.0020 in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Estonia, and Canada to less than 1.0008 in Mexico and Spain. Short term excess mortality in association with exposure to ozone higher than maximum background levels (70 µg/m 3 ) was 0.26% (95% confidence interval 0.24% to 0.28%), corresponding to 8203 annual excess deaths (95% confidence interval 3525 to 12 840) across the 406 cities studied. The excess remained at 0.20% (0.18% to 0.22%) when restricting to days above the WHO guideline (100 µg/m 3 ), corresponding to 6262 annual excess deaths (1413 to 11 065). Above more lenient thresholds for air quality standards in Europe, America, and China, excess mortality was 0.14%, 0.09%, and 0.05%, respectively. Conclusions Results suggest that ozone related mortality could be potentially reduced under stricter air quality standards. These findings have relevance for the implementation of efficient clean air interventions and mitigation strategies designed within national and international climate policies.",2020-02-10,2020,Ana M.

Those who made no error in the knowledge test (AOR = 1.77, p &lt; 0.001) perceived the high severity of the epidemic (AOR = 1.90, p &lt; 0.001), had high negative emotion (AOR = 1.36, p = 0.005), reported good health (AOR = 1.94, p &lt; 0.001), paid high attention to the governmental media (AOR = 4.16, p &lt; 0.001) and trusted the governmental media (AOR = 1.97, p &lt; 0.001) were more likely to embrace protective behaviors after adjustments for variations in potential confounding factors. Women and older people were also more likely to embrace protective behaviors. No regional or educational differences were found in the adoption of protective behaviors. Conclusion The majority of Chinese citizens embraced protective behaviors. Higher levels of protective behaviors are associated with higher knowledge, perceived severity, negative emotion, and attention to and trust in the official governmental media. Official governmental communication is the largest single predictor of protective behaviors.",2020-11-23,2020,Liangwen Ning; Jinyu Niu; Xuejing Bi; Chao Yang; Ze Liu,La Trobe University,BMC Public Health,221,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09892-y,Defense_Security,Biostatistics; Medicine; Cross-sectional study; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Outbreak,0.15
W3000569779,Antenatal depression and its association with adverse birth outcomes in low and middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Depression in pregnancy (antenatal depression) in many low and middle-income countries is not well documented and has not been given priority for intervention due to competing urgencies and the belief that it does not immediately cause fatalities, which mainly emanated from lack of comprehensive research on the area. To fill this research gap, this systematic review was conducted to investigate the burden of antenatal depression and its consequences on birth outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.We systematically searched the databases: CINHAL, MEDLINE, EMCare, PubMed, PSyc Info, Psychiatry online, and Scopus for studies conducted in low and middle-income countries about antenatal depression and its association with adverse birth outcomes. We have included observational studies (case control, cross-sectional and cohort studies), written in English-language, scored in the range of ""good quality"" on the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS), and were published between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2017. Studies were excluded if a standardized approach was not used to measure main outcomes, they were conducted on restricted (high risk) populations, or had fair to poor quality score on NOS. We used Higgins and Egger's to test for heterogeneity and publication bias. Primary estimates were pooled using a random effect meta-analysis. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO with protocol number CRD42017082624.We included 64 studies (with 44, 035 women) on antenatal depression and nine studies (with 5,540 women) on adverse birth outcomes. Antenatal depression was higher in the lower-income countries (Pooled Prevalence (PP) = 34.0%; 95%CI: 33.1%-34.9%) compared to the middle-income countries (PP = 22.7%, 95%CI: 20.1%-25.2%) and increased over the three trimesters. Pregnant women with a history of economic difficulties, poor marital relationships, common mental disorders, poor social support, bad obstetric history, and exposure to violence were more likely to report antenatal depression. The risk of having preterm birth (2.41; 1.47-3.56) and low birth weight (1.66; 1.06-2.61) was higher in depressed mothers compared to mothers without depression.Antenatal depression was higher in low-income countries than in middle-income countries and was found to be a risk factor for low birth weight and preterm births. The economic, maternal, and psychosocial risk factors were responsible for the occurrence of antenatal depression. While there could be competing priority agenda to juggle for health policymakers in low-income countries, interventions for antenatal depression should be reprioritized as vitally important in order to prevent the poor maternal and perinatal outcomes identified in this review.",2020-01-10,2020,Abel Fekadu Dadi; Emma R.

W3033694598,A global outlook to the interruption of education due to COVID-19 pandemic: Navigating in a time of uncertainty and crisis,"Uncertain times require prompt reflexes to survive and this study is a collaborative reflex to better understand uncertainty and navigate through it. The Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic hit hard and interrupted many dimensions of our lives, particularly education. As a response to interruption of education due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this study is a collaborative reaction that narrates the overall view, reflections from the K-12 and higher educational landscape, lessons learned and suggestions from a total of 31 countries across the world with a representation of 62,7% of the whole world population. In addition to the value of each case by country, the synthesis of this research suggests that the current practices can be defined as emergency remote education and this practice is different from planned practices such as distance education, online learning or other derivations. Above all, this study points out how social injustice, inequity and the digital divide have been exacerbated during the pandemic and need unique and targeted measures if they are to be addressed. While there are support communities and mechanisms, parents are overburdened between regular daily/professional duties and emerging educational roles, and all parties are experiencing trauma, psychological pressure and anxiety to various degrees, which necessitates a pedagogy of care, affection and empathy. In terms of educational processes, the interruption of education signifies the importance of openness in education and highlights issues that should be taken into consideration such as using alternative assessment and evaluation methods as well as concerns about surveillance, ethics, and data privacy resulting from nearly exclusive dependency on online solutions.",2020-06-06,2020,Aras Bozkurt; Insung Jung; Junhong Xiao; Viviane Vladimirschi; Robert Schuwer,Deakin University,,203,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3878571,Defense_Security,Pandemic; Empathy; Openness to experience; Public relations; Population,0.283

Design Two stage, time series approach, with overdispersed generalised linear models and multilevel meta-analysis. Setting 398 cities in 22 low to high income countries/regions. Main outcome measures Daily deaths from total (62.8 million), cardiovascular (19.7 million), and respiratory (5.5 million) causes between 1973 and 2018. Results On average, a 10 μg/m 3 increase in NO 2 concentration on lag 1 day (previous day) was associated with 0.46% (95% confidence interval 0.36% to 0.57%), 0.37% (0.22% to 0.51%), and 0.47% (0.21% to 0.72%) increases in total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively. These associations remained robust after adjusting for co-pollutants (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm or ≤2.5 μm (PM 10 and PM 2.5 , respectively), ozone, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide). The pooled concentration-response curves for all three causes were almost linear without discernible thresholds. The proportion of deaths attributable to NO 2 concentration above the counterfactual zero level was 1.23% (95% confidence interval 0.96% to 1.51%) across the 398 cities. Conclusions This multilocation study provides key evidence on the independent and linear associations between short term exposure to NO 2 and increased risk of total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, suggesting that health benefits would be achieved by tightening the guidelines and regulatory limits of NO 2 .",2021-03-24,2021,Xia Meng; Cong Liu; Renjie Chen; Francesco Sera; Ana María Vicedo-Cabrera,Monash University,BMJ,203,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n534,Defense_Security,Confidence interval; Nitrogen dioxide; Medicine; Respiratory system; Ozone,0.15
W4288083593,The origin of spin in binary black holes,"Context. After years of scientific progress, the origin of stellar binary black holes is still a great mystery. Several formation channels for merging black holes have been proposed in the literature. As more merger detections are expected with future gravitational-wave observations, population synthesis studies can help to distinguish between them. Aims. We study the formation of coalescing binary black holes via the evolution of isolated field binaries that go through the common envelope phase in order to obtain the combined distributions of observables such as black-hole spins, masses and cosmological redshifts of mergers. Methods. To achieve this aim, we used a hybrid technique that combines the parametric binary population synthesis code COMPAS with detailed binary evolution simulations performed with the MESA code. We then convolved our binary evolution calculations with the redshift- and metallicity-dependent star-formation rate and the selection effects of gravitational-wave detectors to obtain predictions of observable properties. Results. By assuming efficient angular momentum transport, we are able to present a model that is capable of simultaneously predicting the following three main gravitational-wave observables: the effective inspiral spin parameter χ eff , the chirp mass M chirp and the cosmological redshift of merger z merger . We find an excellent agreement between our model and the ten events from the first two advanced detector observing runs. We make predictions for the third observing run O3 and for Advanced LIGO design sensitivity. We expect approximately 80% of events with χ eff &lt; 0.1, while the remaining 20% of events with χ eff ≥ 0.1 are split into ∼10% with M chirp &lt; 15 M ⊙ and ∼10% with M chirp ≥ 15 M ⊙ . Moreover, we find that M chirp and χ eff distributions are very weakly dependent on the detector sensitivity. Conclusions. The favorable comparison of the existing LIGO/Virgo observations with our model predictions gives support to the idea that the majority, if not all of the observed mergers, originate from the evolution of isolated binaries. The first-born black hole has negligible spin because it lost its envelope after it expanded to become a giant star, while the spin of the second-born black hole is determined by the tidal spin up of its naked helium star progenitor by the first-born black hole companion after the binary finished the common-envelope phase.",2020-01-24,2020,Simone S.

W4287848462,Intelligent robots for fruit harvesting: recent developments and future challenges,"Abstract Intelligent robots for fruit harvesting have been actively developed over the past decades to bridge the increasing gap between feeding a rapidly growing population and limited labour resources. Despite significant advancements in this field, widespread use of harvesting robots in orchards is yet to be seen. To identify the challenges and formulate future research and development directions, this work reviews the state-of-the-art of intelligent fruit harvesting robots by comparing their system architectures, visual perception approaches, fruit detachment methods and system performances. The potential reasons behind the inadequate performance of existing harvesting robots are analysed and a novel map of challenges and potential research directions is created, considering both environmental factors and user requirements.",2022-06-02,2022,Hongyu Zhou; Xing Wang; Wesley Au; Hanwen Kang; Chao Chen,Monash University,Precision Agriculture,200,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11119-022-09913-3,Defense_Security,Robot; Bridge (graph theory); Field (mathematics); Computer science; Population,0.3
W3036271288,"“<i>We aren't your reincarnation!</i>” workplace motivation across X, Y and Z generations","Purpose The primary purpose of this research is to examine generational differences in valuing the sources of employees' overall motivation in the workplace across Generation X, Generation Y and Generation Z with a view of assisting managers in making employment decisions and maintaining multigenerational staff. Design/methodology/approach The respondents in the study live and work in Canada and provided answers to self-administered online surveys between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the end of January 2020. To assess subjects' work motivation, the study employed Gagné et al. 's (2014) multidimensional work motivation scale (MWMS) alongside a three-item measure of employees' overall motivation (designed for this study). The authors assessed measures of validity and reliability and tested the hypothesis about generational differences in work motivation using structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings The six motivators regress differently to employees' overall motivation. Generation Z is more sensitive to amotivation than Generation X and Generation Y. Extrinsic regulation-material is a valid source of overall work motivation for Generation Z only. Only Generation X values extrinsic regulation-social as a source of employees' overall motivation. So is introjected regulation by Generation Y. Unlike Generation Z, both Generation X and Generation Y employees value identified regulation as a source of overall work motivation. Finally, intrinsic motivation contributes more to Generation Z employees' overall work motivation than it does for Generation X and Generation Y. Research limitations/implications Further work needs to be done to establish whether variations in valuing the sources of motivation may also be spawned by age or status of the respective groups. Future investigations can expand the authors’ focal theme to include additional organisational outcomes, alternative geographical settings and/or include country's economic development as an additional variable. Moreover, further research can address the implications of national culture on shaping generational differences in employee's motivation as well as aiding companies to redesign work tasks considering today's uncertainty as well as increasingly competitive, global environment (e.g. the rise of artificial intelligence). Practical implications It is vital to offer motivators that are valued by each of the three generations, i.e. X, Y and Z, before being able to attract the best candidates of each generation. Organisations should not only create an inclusive and understanding multigenerational working environment but also be able to communicate strong branding via new communication channels successfully (e.g. social media networks), which Generation Yers and Generation Zers utilise better than any other generation in employment. Finally, the authors suggest that service organisations with diverse generational composition should adopt new measures of workplace agility to survive interminable disruptions (e.g. the coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] pandemic). Originality/value This is the first study of its kind to examine generational differences between Generation X, Generation Y and Generation Z in valuing workplace motivation from a western cultural perspective.",2020-06-17,2020,Ali B.

W4306150151,"Severe COVID-19 outcomes after full vaccination of primary schedule and initial boosters: pooled analysis of national prospective cohort studies of 30 million individuals in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales","BackgroundCurrent UK vaccination policy is to offer future COVID-19 booster doses to individuals at high risk of serious illness from COVID-19, but it is still uncertain which groups of the population could benefit most. In response to an urgent request from the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, we aimed to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes (ie, COVID-19-related hospitalisation or death) in individuals who had completed their primary COVID-19 vaccination schedule and had received the first booster vaccine.MethodsWe constructed prospective cohorts across all four UK nations through linkages of primary care, RT-PCR testing, vaccination, hospitalisation, and mortality data on 30 million people. We included individuals who received primary vaccine doses of BNT162b2 (tozinameran; Pfizer–BioNTech) or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford–AstraZeneca) vaccines in our initial analyses. We then restricted analyses to those given a BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (elasomeran; Moderna) booster and had a severe COVID-19 outcome between Dec 20, 2021, and Feb 28, 2022 (when the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant was dominant). We fitted time-dependent Poisson regression models and calculated adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) and 95% CIs for the associations between risk factors and COVID-19-related hospitalisation or death. We adjusted for a range of potential covariates, including age, sex, comorbidities, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Stratified analyses were conducted by vaccine type. We then did pooled analyses across UK nations using fixed-effect meta-analyses.FindingsBetween Dec 8, 2020, and Feb 28, 2022, 16 208 600 individuals completed their primary vaccine schedule and 13 836 390 individuals received a booster dose. Between Dec 20, 2021, and Feb 28, 2022, 59 510 (0·4%) of the primary vaccine group and 26 100 (0·2%) of those who received their booster had severe COVID-19 outcomes. The risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes reduced after receiving the booster (rate change: 8·8 events per 1000 person-years to 7·6 events per 1000 person-years). Older adults (≥80 years vs 18–49 years; aRR 3·60 [95% CI 3·45–3·75]), those with comorbidities (≥5 comorbidities vs none; 9·51 [9·07–9·97]), being male (male vs female; 1·23 [1·20–1·26]), and those with certain underlying health conditions—in particular, individuals receiving immunosuppressants (yes vs no; 5·80 [5·53–6·09])—and those with chronic kidney disease (stage 5 vs no; 3·71 [2·90–4·74]) remained at high risk despite the initial booster. Individuals with a history of COVID-19 infection were at reduced risk (infected ≥9 months before booster dose vs no previous infection; aRR 0·41 [95% CI 0·29–0·58]).InterpretationOlder people, those with multimorbidity, and those with specific underlying health conditions remain at increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation and death after the initial vaccine booster and should, therefore, be prioritised for additional boosters, including novel optimised versions, and the increasing array of COVID-19 therapeutics.FundingNational Core Studies–Immunity, UK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council), Health Data Research UK, the Scottish Government, and the University of Edinburgh.",2022-10-01,2022,Utkarsh Agrawal; Stuart Bedston; Colin McCowan; Jason Oke; Lynsey Patterson,Victoria University of Wellington,The Lancet,190,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(22)01656-7,Defense_Security,Vaccination; Medicine; Poisson regression; Demography; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),0.225
W3091882470,The global prevalence and trend of human intestinal carriage of ESBL-producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> in the community,"Intestinal colonization by ESBL Escherichia coli and its association with community-acquired MDR infections is of great concern. This review determined the worldwide prevalence of human faecal ESBL E. coli carriage and its trend in the community over the past two decades.A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar to retrieve articles published between 1 January 2000 and 13 February 2020 that contained data on the prevalence of faecal carriage of ESBL E. coli among healthy individuals. A cumulative (for the whole period) meta-analysis was used to estimate the global and regional pooled prevalence rates. Articles were grouped into study periods of 3 years, and subgroup meta-analyses were undertaken to examine the global pooled prevalence over time.Sixty-two articles covering 29 872 healthy persons were included in this meta-analysis. The cumulative (2003-18) global pooled prevalence of ESBL E. coli intestinal carriage in the community was 16.5% (95% CI 14.3%-18.7%; P < 0.001). The pooled prevalence showed an upward trend, increasing from 2.6% (95% CI 1.6%-4.0%) in 2003-05 to 21.1% (95% CI 15.8%-27.0%) in 2015-18. Over the whole period, the highest carriage rate was observed in South-East Asia (27%; 95% CI 2.9%-51.3%), while the lowest occurred in Europe (6.0%; 95% CI 4.6%-7.5%).Globally, an 8-fold increase in the intestinal carriage rate of ESBL E. coli in the community has occurred over the past two decades.

Smith), is native to the Americas. It has rapidly invaded 47 African countries and 18 Asian countries since the first detection of invasion into Nigeria and Ghana in 2016. It is regarded as a super pest based on its host range (at least 353 host plants), its inherent ability to survive in a wide range of habitats, its strong migration ability, high fecundity, rapid development of resistance to insecticides/viruses and its gluttonous characteristics. The inherently superior biological characteristics of FAW contribute to its invasiveness. Integrated pest management (IPM) of FAW has relied on multiple applications of monitoring and scouting, agricultural control, chemical pesticides, viral insecticides, sex attractants, bio-control agents (parasitoids, predators and entomopathogens) and botanicals. Knowledge gaps remain to be filled to: (1) understand the invasive mechanisms of S. frugiperda; (2) understand how to prevent its further spread and (3) provide better management strategies.

W3126099275,Population vs Individual Prediction of Poor Health From Results of Adverse Childhood Experiences Screening,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are well-established risk factors for health problems in a population. However, it is not known whether screening for ACEs can accurately identify individuals who develop later health problems.To test the predictive accuracy of ACE screening for later health problems.This study comprised 2 birth cohorts: the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study observed 2232 participants born during the period from 1994 to 1995 until they were aged 18 years (2012-2014); the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study observed 1037 participants born during the period from 1972 to 1973 until they were aged 45 years (2017-2019). Statistical analysis was performed from May 28, 2018, to July 29, 2020.ACEs were measured prospectively in childhood through repeated interviews and observations in both cohorts. ACEs were also measured retrospectively in the Dunedin cohort through interviews at 38 years.Health outcomes were assessed at 18 years in E-Risk and at 45 years in the Dunedin cohort. Mental health problems were assessed through clinical interviews using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Physical health problems were assessed through interviews, anthropometric measurements, and blood collection.Of 2232 E-Risk participants, 2009 (1051 girls [52%]) were included in the analysis. Of 1037 Dunedin cohort participants, 918 (460 boys [50%]) were included in the analysis. In E-Risk, children with higher ACE scores had greater risk of later health problems (any mental health problem: relative risk, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.10-1.18] per each additional ACE; any physical health problem: relative risk, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.07-1.12] per each additional ACE). ACE scores were associated with health problems independent of other information typically available to clinicians (ie, sex, socioeconomic disadvantage, and history of health problems). However, ACE scores had poor accuracy in predicting an individual's risk of later health problems (any mental health problem: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.56-0.61]; any physical health problem: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.58-0.63]; chance prediction: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.50). Findings were consistent in the Dunedin cohort using both prospective and retrospective ACE measures.This study suggests that, although ACE scores can forecast mean group differences in health, they have poor accuracy in predicting an individual's risk of later health problems. Therefore, targeting interventions based on ACE screening is likely to be ineffective in preventing poor health outcomes.",2021-01-26,2021,Jessie R. Baldwin; Avshalom Caspi; Alan J.

W3110863112,Four priority areas to advance invasion science in the face of rapid environmental change,"Unprecedented rates of introduction and spread of non-native species pose burgeoning challenges to biodiversity, natural resource management, regional economies, and human health. Current biosecurity efforts are failing to keep pace with globalization, revealing critical gaps in our understanding and response to invasions. Here, we identify four priority areas to advance invasion science in the face of rapid global environmental change. First, invasion science should strive to develop a more comprehensive framework for predicting how the behavior, abundance, and interspecific interactions of non-native species vary in relation to conditions in receiving environments and how these factors govern the ecological impacts of invasion. A second priority is to understand the potential synergistic effects of multiple co-occurring stressors— particularly involving climate change—on the establishment and impact of non-native species. Climate adaptation and mitigation strategies will need to consider the possible consequences of promoting non-native species, and appropriate management responses to non-native species will need to be developed. The third priority is to address the taxonomic impediment. The ability to detect and evaluate invasion risks is compromised by a growing deficit in taxonomic expertise, which cannot be adequately compensated by new molecular technologies alone. Management of biosecurity risks will become increasingly challenging unless academia, industry, and governments train and employ new personnel in taxonomy and systematics. Fourth, we recommend that internationally cooperative biosecurity strategies consider the bridgehead effects of global dispersal networks, in which organisms tend to invade new regions from locations where they have already established. Cooperation among countries to eradicate or control species established in bridgehead regions should yield greater benefit than independent attempts by individual countries to exclude these species from arriving and establishing.",2020-12-07,2020,Anthony Ricciardi; Josephine C.

W3034427160,Energy-Aware Marine Predators Algorithm for Task Scheduling in IoT-Based Fog Computing Applications,"To improve the quality of service (QoS) needed by several applications areas, the Internet of Things (IoT) tasks are offloaded into the fog computing instead of the cloud. However, the availability of ongoing energy heads for fog computing servers is one of the constraints for IoT applications because transmitting the huge quantity of the data generated using IoT devices will produce network bandwidth overhead and slow down the responsive time of the statements analyzed. In this article, an energy-aware model basis on the marine predators algorithm (MPA) is proposed for tackling the task scheduling in fog computing (TSFC) to improve the QoSs required by users. In addition to the standard MPA, we proposed the other two versions. The first version is called modified MPA (MMPA), which will modify MPA to improve their exploitation capability by using the last updated positions instead of the last best one. The second one will improve MMPA by the ranking strategy based reinitialization and mutation toward the best, in addition to reinitializing, the half population randomly after a predefined number of iterations to get rid of local optima and mutated the last half toward the best-so-far solution. Accordingly, MPA is proposed to solve the continuous one, whereas the TSFC is considered a discrete one, so the normalization and scaling phase will be used to convert the standard MPA into a discrete one. The three versions are proposed with some other metaheuristic algorithms and genetic algorithms based on various performance metrics such as energy consumption, makespan, flow time, and carbon dioxide emission rate. The improved MMPA could outperform all the other algorithms and the other two versions.",2020-06-11,2020,Mohamed Abdel‐Basset; Reda Mohamed; Mohamed Elhoseny; Ali Kashif Bashir; Alireza Jolfaei,Macquarie University,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,175,https://doi.org/10.1109/tii.2020.3001067,Defense_Security,Computer science; Server; Distributed computing; Scheduling (production processes); Energy consumption,0.375
W3119768240,Effects of undernutrition on mortality and morbidity among adults living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Background Undernutrition is one of the most common problems among people living with HIV, contributing to premature death and the development of comorbidities within this population. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the impacts of these often inter-related conditions appear in a series of fragmented and inconclusive studies. Thus, this review examines the pooled effects of undernutrition on mortality and morbidities among adults living with HIV in SSA. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted from PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Scopus databases. All observational studies reporting the effects of undernutrition on mortality and morbidity among adults living with HIV in SSA were included. Heterogeneity between the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Q-test and I 2 statistics. Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s and Begg’s tests at a 5% significance level. Finally, a random-effects meta-analysis model was employed to estimate the overall adjusted hazard ratio. Results Of 4309 identified studies, 53 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Of these, 40 studies were available for the meta-analysis. A meta-analysis of 23 cohort studies indicated that undernutrition significantly (AHR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.8, 2.4) increased the risk of mortality among adults living with HIV, while severely undernourished adults living with HIV were at higher risk of death (AHR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.9, 2.8) as compared to mildly undernourished adults living with HIV. Furthermore, the pooled estimates of ten cohort studies revealed that undernutrition significantly increased the risk of developing tuberculosis (AHR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.6, 2.7) among adults living with HIV. Conclusion This review found that undernutrition has significant effects on mortality and morbidity among adults living with HIV. As the degree of undernutrition became more severe, mortality rate also increased. Therefore, findings from this review may be used to update the nutritional guidelines used for the management of PLHIV by different stakeholders, especially in limited-resource settings.",2021-01-04,2021,Animut Alebel; Daniel Demant; Pammla Petrucka; David Sibbritt,University of Technology Sydney,BMC Infectious Diseases,173,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05706-z,Defense_Security,Medicine; Malnutrition; Meta-analysis; Cohort study; Population,0.225
W2884982506,Forced Migration and Human Capital: Evidence from Post-WWII Population Transfers,"We study the long-run effects of forced migration on investment in education. After World War II, millions of Poles were forcibly uprooted from the Kresy territories of eastern Poland and resettled (primarily) in the newly acquired Western Territories, from which the Germans were expelled. We combine historical censuses with newly collected survey data to show that, while there were no pre-WWII differences in educational attainment, Poles with a family history of forced migration are significantly more educated today than other Poles. These results are driven by a shift in preferences away from material possessions toward investment in human capital. (JEL I25, I26, J24, N34, R23)",2020-04-28,2020,Sascha O.

W3045367604,"Internet Use, Sustainable Agricultural Practices and Rural Incomes: Evidence from China","Relatively little is known about the association between Internet use and environmentally‐friendly agricultural innovation adoption. To fill this void, this study examines the impact of Internet use on the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) and their heterogeneous effects on farm income and household income. Unlike previous studies that analyse the dichotomous decision of agricultural innovation adoption, this study captures the number of SAPs adopted. We apply both endogenous‐treatment Poisson regression model and unconditional quantile regression model to analyse unique farm‐level data collected from China. The empirical results show that Internet use exerts a positive and statistically significant impact on the number of SAPs adopted, and the joint effects of Internet use and SAP adoption on farm income and household income are heterogeneous. In particular, we show that Internet use has a larger impact at the upper tail of household income but it has no significant impact on farm income. SAP adoption is negatively associated with farm income and household income across the selected quantiles.",2020-07-22,2020,Wanglin Ma; Xiaobing Wang,Lincoln University,Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics,165,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.12390,Defense_Security,Quantile regression; The Internet; Agriculture; Household income; China,0.15
W3015987463,Prevalence of Internet Addiction and Gaming Disorders in Southeast Asia: A Meta-Analysis,"This meta-analytic review aimed to examine the pooled prevalence rates of Internet addiction and gaming disorders in Southeast Asia. Several databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Central were searched and a total of 24 studies were included in this study. The selection of studies was conducted in accordance to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Two meta-analyses were conducted to examine data on Internet addiction and gaming disorders separately. A random-effects model was employed to derive the pooled prevalence rate. Mixed-effects meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to examine the moderators of the between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias was tested using the Egger’s regression test and funnel plot. Only seven out of the 11 Southeast Asian countries were represented in the literature. All except for two of the included studies were cross-sectional in nature. The findings revealed a pooled prevalence rate of 20.0% (95% confidence interval: 14.5%–27.0%) and 10.1% (95% confidence interval: 7.3%–13.8%) for Internet addiction and gaming disorders respectively. Mean age and study population were significant moderators of the between-study heterogeneity in the prevalence rates of gaming disorders such that samples involving older participants showed higher prevalence rate than those involving younger individuals. Country of study was found to be significant moderator of the between-heterogeneity for both Internet addiction and gaming disorders, however the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the small and unbalanced sample sizes. There was no significant publication bias. Such epidemiology research should be extended to the Southeast Asian countries that have not been studied or are under-studied. Given that the prevalence rates appear to be higher in Southeast Asia than in other world regions, future research should also explore the factors behind these inter-regional differences. Further longitudinal studies should also be conducted to examine the trajectories of such disorders.",2020-04-09,2020,Doris Xin Yi Chia; Charis Wei Ling Ng; Gomathinayagam Kandasami; Mavis Y. L.

W3137225051,Fear of COVID‐19 Scale (FCV‐19S) across countries: Measurement invariance issues,"Abstract Aim The threats of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) have caused fears worldwide. The Fear of COVID‐19 Scale (FCV‐19S) was recently developed to assess the fear of COVID‐19. Although many studies found that the FCV‐19S is psychometrically sound, it is unclear whether the FCV‐19S is invariant across countries. The present study aimed to examine the measurement invariance of the FCV‐19S across eleven countries. Design Cross‐sectional study. Methods Using data collected from prior research on Bangladesh ( N = 8,550), United Kingdom ( N = 344), Brazil ( N = 1,843), Taiwan ( N = 539), Italy ( N = 249), New Zealand ( N = 317), Iran ( N = 717), Cuba ( N = 772), Pakistan ( N = 937), Japan ( N = 1,079) and France ( N = 316), comprising a total 15,663 participants, the present study used the multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Rasch differential item functioning (DIF) to examine the measurement invariance of the FCV‐19S across country, gender and age (children aged below 18 years, young to middle‐aged adults aged between 18 and 60 years, and older people aged above 60 years). Results The unidimensional structure of the FCV‐19S was confirmed. Multigroup CFA showed that FCV‐19S was partially invariant across country and fully invariant across gender and age. DIF findings were consistent with the findings from multigroup CFA. Many DIF items were displayed for country, few DIF items were displayed for age, and no DIF items were displayed for gender. Conclusion Based on the results of the present study, the FCV‐19S is a good psychometric instrument to assess fear of COVID‐19 during the pandemic period. Moreover, the use of FCV‐19S is supported in at least ten countries with satisfactory psychometric properties.",2021-03-21,2021,Chung‐Ying Lin; Wen‐Li Hou; Mohammed A.

W3153403085,"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on snacking habits, fast-food and alcohol consumption: A systematic review of the evidence","The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and lockdown measures, that were implemented in many countries in order to control the virus transmission, had negatively influenced the lifestyle of millions of people worldwide. In this study we aimed to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown period (March-May 2020) on snacking behavior, fast-food and alcohol consumption. A systematic search in PubMed®, Scopus® and Web of Science® databases was conducted and 32 studies were included. Changes in snacking, in fast-food and ordered food consumption and in alcohol intake were examined. Snacking was found to be increased for a significant portion of the population examined (18.9-45.1%), whereas fast food (15.0-41.3%) and ordered food (33.9%) showed a tendency towards decrease. As per alcohol consumption, an upward trend was observed in a significant part (10.4-51.0%) of the participants examined. The increased snacking and alcohol consumption observed for almost a third of the examined population could be alarming because long-term health problems could arise in cases of repeated lockdowns in the future. The observed downward trend in fast-food consumption and in frequency of ordered food could be an encouraging sign of turning to home-prepared foods, but further research is needed in this field.",2021-04-17,2021,Dimitra Rafailia Bakaloudi; Dhanushya T.

Linear regression models were used to evaluate associations between dietary share of ultraprocessed foods (country and age group-specific quintiles and a 10% share increase) and the energy density of diets and their content of free sugars and fiber. Ultraprocessed foods, defined by the NOVA system, ranged from 18% of total energy intake among preschool children in Colombia to 68% among adolescents in the United Kingdom. In almost all countries and age groups, increases in the dietary share of ultraprocessed foods were associated with increases in energy density and free sugars and decreases in fiber, suggesting that ultraprocessed food consumption is a potential determinant of obesity in children and adolescents. Effective global policy action to address growing ultraprocessed food consumption and childhood obesity is urgently needed.",2021-12-09,2021,Daniela Neri; Eurídice Martínez Steele; Neha Khandpur; Gustavo Cediel; María Elisa Zapata,Deakin University,Obesity Reviews,154,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13387,Defense_Security,Obesity; Environmental health; Medicine; Nutrient density; Consumption (sociology),0.225
W3128549153,Overfishing and habitat loss drive range contraction of iconic marine fishes to near extinction,"Extinctions on land are often inferred from sparse sightings over time, but this technique is ill-suited for wide-ranging species. We develop a space-for-time approach to track the spatial contraction and drivers of decline of sawfishes. These iconic and endangered shark-like rays were once found in warm, coastal waters of 90 nations and are now presumed extinct in more than half (n = 46). Using dynamic geography theory, we predict that sawfishes are gone from at least nine additional nations. Overfishing and habitat loss have reduced spatial occupancy, leading to local extinctions in 55 of the 90 nations, which equates to 58.7% of their historical distribution. Retention bans and habitat protections are urgently necessary to secure a future for sawfishes and similar species.",2021-02-10,2021,Helen F. Yan; Peter M. Kyne; Rima W. Jabado; Ruth H.

W3133979447,Blood lead levels in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review,"BackgroundSince the global phase-out of leaded petrol, reports have suggested that lead exposure remains substantial or is increasing in some low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, few studies have attempted to systematically assess blood lead levels over the full range of LMICs. We aimed to describe values for blood lead level in LMICs.MethodsIn this systematic review, we searched PubMed for studies published between Jan 1, 2010, and Oct 31, 2019, that reported blood lead levels in the 137 countries in World Bank LMIC groupings. Studies were reviewed for inclusion if they contained blood lead level data from human populations residing in any given country; comprised at least 30 participants; presented blood lead level data derived from venous, capillary, or umbilical cord samples of whole blood; had data that were collected after Dec 31, 2004; and were published in English. Data on blood lead level were extracted and pooled, as appropriate, to make country-specific estimates of the distribution of background blood lead levels among children and adults, along with information on specific sources of exposure where available. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018108706.FindingsOur search yielded 12 695 studies, of which 520 were eligible for inclusion (1100 sampled populations from 49 countries comprising 1 003 455 individuals). Pooled mean blood lead concentrations in children ranged from 1·66 μg/dL (SD 3·31) in Ethiopia to 9·30 μg/dL (11·73) in Palestine, and in adults from 0·39 μg/dL (1·25) in Sudan to 11·36 μg/dL (5·20) in Pakistan. Background values for blood lead level in children could be pooled in 34 countries and were used to estimate background distributions for 1·30 billion of them. 632 million children (95% CI 394 million–780 million; 48·5%) were estimated to have a blood lead level exceeding the US Centers for Disease Control's reference value of 5 μg/dL. Major sources of lead exposure were informal lead acid battery recycling and manufacture, metal mining and processing, electronic waste, and the use of lead as a food adulterant, primarily in spices.InterpretationMany children have a blood lead level exceeding 5 μg/dL in LMICs, despite leaded petrol phase-outs. Given the toxicity of lead, even at low amounts of exposure, urgent attention is required to control exposures and to expand population-based sampling in countries with no or scant data.FundingThis work was supported by the United States Agency for International Development (Cooperative Agreement number AID-OAA-A-16-00019).",2021-03-01,2021,Bret Ericson; Howard Hu; Emily Nash; Gregory L.

W3178756396,Automated Deep CNN-LSTM Architecture Design for Solar Irradiance Forecasting,"Accurate prediction of solar energy is an important issue for photovoltaic power plants to enable early participation in energy auction industries and cost-effective resource planning. This article introduces a new deep learning-based multistep ahead approach to improve the forecasting performance of global horizontal irradiance (GHI). A deep convolutional long short-term memory is used to extract optimal features for accurate prediction of the GHI. The performance of such deep neural networks directly depends on their architectures. To deal with this problem, a swarm evolutionary optimization method, called the sine-cosine algorithm, is applied and advanced to automatically optimize the network architecture. A three-phase modification model is proposed to increase the diversity of population and avoid premature convergence in the optimization mechanism. The performance of the proposed method is investigated using three datasets collected from three solar stations in the east of the United States. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to other forecasting models.",2021-07-12,2021,Seyed Mohammad Jafar Jalali; Sajad Ahmadian; Abdollah Kavousi‐Fard; Abbas Khosravi; Saeid Nahavandi,Deakin University,IEEE Transactions on Systems Man and Cybernetics Systems,137,https://doi.org/10.1109/tsmc.2021.3093519,Defense_Security,Computer science; Deep learning; Particle swarm optimization; Solar irradiance; Convolutional neural network,0.375
W4210310627,Why food insecurity persists in sub-Saharan Africa: A review of existing evidence,"This article is the third in a series of historical reviews on sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), exploring why agricultural production and irrigation schemes are underperforming, and how this contributes to high levels of food insecurity. The expression 'food security' emerged in 1974 following the Sahel and Darfur famines. Despite SSA being a net agricultural exporter, food insecurity has persisted and is increasing. This is largely a legacy of the export-oriented colonial agricultural production systems, which procured scarce fertile land, water and labour to meet the needs of industries and consumers in the Global North. Colonialism also undermined the social contract between traditional leaders and communities, which had been instrumental in managing food scarcity in earlier times. Post-independence, agricultural policies remained focused on exports and neglected critical research and investment: integrating food productions systems into the domestic economy; developing supply chains and associated market, storage and value-adding infrastructure; and introducing appropriate technologies. As a result, Africa is the only region in the world where increased export production caused a decline in per capita food production. African nations should be extracted from the debt accrued due to poor colonial investments, World Bank lending practices, and global currency and interest fluctuations, which have crippled their capacity to support agriculture and improve livelihoods and food security. Farming needs to be profitable, which includes farmers being connected to domestic supply chains and market signals, local value-adding, and post-harvest storage. This will create jobs and increase income earning capacity, which is the key to households' food security.",2022-02-03,2022,Vibeke Bjornlund; Henning Bjørnlund; André van Rooyen,University of South Australia,Food Security,135,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12571-022-01256-1,Defense_Security,Food security; Agriculture; Livelihood; Agricultural productivity; Food systems,0.225
W3125077253,Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE),"Context. One of the long-term goals of exoplanet science is the atmospheric characterization of dozens of small exoplanets in order to understand their diversity and search for habitable worlds and potential biosignatures. Achieving this goal requires a space mission of sufficient scale that can spatially separate the signals from exoplanets and their host stars and thus directly scrutinize the exoplanets and their atmospheres. Aims. We seek to quantify the exoplanet detection performance of a space-based mid-infrared (MIR) nulling interferometer that measures the thermal emission of exoplanets. We study the impact of various parameters and compare the performance with that of large single-aperture mission concepts that detect exoplanets in reflected light. Methods. We have developed an instrument simulator that considers all major astrophysical noise sources and coupled it with Monte Carlo simulations of a synthetic exoplanet population around main-sequence stars within 20 pc of the Sun. This allows us to quantify the number (and types) of exoplanets that our mission concept could detect. Considering single visits only, we discuss two different scenarios for distributing 2.5 yr of an initial search phase among the stellar targets. Different apertures sizes and wavelength ranges are investigated. Results. An interferometer consisting of four 2 m apertures working in the 4–18.5 μ.m wavelength range with a total instrument throughput of 5% could detect up to ≈550 exoplanets with radii between 0.5 and 6 R ⊕ with an integrated S / N ≥ 7. At least ≈160 of the detected exoplanets have radii ≤1.5 R ⊕ . Depending on the observing scenario, ≈25–45 rocky exoplanets (objects with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 R ⊕ ) orbiting within the empirical habitable zone (eHZ) of their host stars are among the detections. With four 3.5 m apertures, the total number of detections can increase to up to ≈770, including ≈60–80 rocky eHZ planets. With four times 1 m apertures, the maximum detection yield is ≈315 exoplanets, including ≤20 rocky eHZ planets. The vast majority of small, temperate exoplanets are detected around M dwarfs. The impact of changing the wavelength range to 3–20 μm or 6–17 μm on the detection yield is negligible. Conclusions. A large space-based MIR nulling interferometer will be able to directly detect hundreds of small, nearby exoplanets, tens of which would be habitable world candidates. This shows that such a mission can compete with large single-aperture reflected light missions. Further increasing the number of habitable world candidates, in particular around solar-type stars, appears possible via the implementation of a multi-visit strategy during the search phase. The high median S/N of most of the detected planets will allow for first estimates of their radii and effective temperatures and will help prioritize the targets for a second mission phase to obtain high-S/N thermal emission spectra, leveraging the superior diagnostic power of the MIR regime compared to shorter wavelengths.",2022-04-12,2022,Sascha P.

W3128808011,Marine mammal conservation: over the horizon,"Marine mammals can play important ecological roles in aquatic ecosystems, and their presence can be key to community structure and function. Consequently, marine mammals are often considered indicators of ecosystem health and flagship species. Yet, historical population declines caused by exploitation, and additional current threats, such as climate change, fisheries bycatch, pollution and maritime development, continue to impact many marine mammal species, and at least 25% are classified as threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable) on the IUCN Red List. Conversely, some species have experienced population increases/recoveries in recent decades, reflecting management interventions, and are heralded as conservation successes. To continue these successes and reverse the downward trajectories of at-risk species, it is necessary to evaluate the threats faced by marine mammals and the conservation mechanisms available to address them. Additionally, there is a need to identify evidence-based priorities of both research and conservation needs across a range of settings and taxa. To that effect we: (1) outline the key threats to marine mammals and their impacts, identify the associated knowledge gaps and recommend actions needed; (2) discuss the merits and downfalls of established and emerging conservation mechanisms; (3) outline the application of research and monitoring techniques; and (4) highlight particular taxa/populations that are in urgent need of focus.",2021-01-28,2021,Sarah E.

W3162231216,Factors affecting success of conservation translocations of terrestrial vertebrates: A global systematic review,"Translocation—moving individuals for release in different locations—is among the most important conservation interventions for increasing or re-establishing populations of threatened species. However, translocations often fail. To improve their effectiveness, we need to understand the features that distinguish successful from failed translocations. We assembled and analysed a global database of translocations of terrestrial vertebrates (n = 514) to assess the effects of various design features and extrinsic factors on success. We analysed outcomes using standardised metrics: a categorical success/failure classification; and population growth rate. Probability of categorical success and population growth rate increased with the total number of individuals released but with diminishing returns above about 20–50 individuals. Positive outcomes—categorical success and high population growth—were less likely for translocations in Oceania, possibly because invasive species are a major threat in this region and are difficult to control at translocation sites. Rates of categorical success and population growth were higher in Europe and North America than elsewhere, suggesting the key role of context in positive translocation outcomes. Categorical success has increased throughout the 20th century, but that increase may have plateaued at about 75% since about 1990. Our results suggest there is potential for further increase in the success of conservation translocations. This could be best achieved by greater investment in individual projects, as indicated by total number of animals released, which has not increased over time.",2021-05-12,2021,Shane D.

W4361224334,Association of Healthful Plant-based Diet Adherence With Risk of Mortality and Major Chronic Diseases Among Adults in the UK,"Importance Plant-based diets have gained popularity for both environmental and health reasons, but a comprehensive assessment of their quality in relation to risk of mortality and major chronic diseases is lacking. Objective To examine whether healthful vs unhealthful plant-based dietary patterns are associated with mortality and major chronic diseases among UK adults. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective cohort study used data from adults in the UK Biobank, a large-scale population-based study. Participants were recruited between 2006 and 2010 and followed up using record linkage data until 2021; follow-up for different outcomes ranged between 10.6 and 12.2 years. Data analysis was conducted from November 2021 to October 2022. Exposures Adherence to a healthful vs unhealthful plant-based diet index (hPDI vs uPDI) derived from 24-hour dietary assessments. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcomes were hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of mortality (overall and cause specific), cardiovascular disease (CVD [total, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke]), cancer (total, breast, prostate, and colorectal), and fracture (total, vertebrae, and hip) across quartiles of hPDI and uPDI adherence. Results This study included 126 394 UK Biobank participants. They had a mean (SD) age of 56.1 (7.8) years; 70 618 (55.9%) were women. The majority of participants (115 371 [91.3%]) were White. Greater adherence to the hPDI was associated with lower risks of total mortality, cancer, and CVD, with HRs (95% CIs) of 0.84 (0.78-0.91), 0.93 (0.88-0.99), and 0.92 (0.86-0.99), respectively, for participants in the highest hPDI quartile compared with the lowest. The hPDI was also associated with lower risks of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, with HRs (95% CIs) of 0.86 (0.78-0.95) and 0.84 (0.71-0.99), respectively. By contrast, higher uPDI scores were associated with higher risks of mortality, CVD, and cancer. The associations observed did not show heterogeneity across strata of sex, smoking status, body mass index, or socioeconomic status or with polygenic risk scores (specifically with regard to CVD end points). Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cohort study of middle-aged UK adults suggest that a diet characterized by high-quality plant-based foods and lower intakes of animal products may be beneficial for health, irrespective of established chronic disease risk factors and genetic predisposition.",2023-03-28,2023,Alysha S.

False news, conspiracy theories, and magical cures were shared with the general public at an alarming rate, which may lead to increased anxiety and stress levels and associated debilitating consequences.To measure the level of COVID-19 information overload (COVIO) and assess the association between COVIO and sociodemographic characteristics among the general public.A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between April and May 2020 using a modified Cancer Information Overload scale. The survey was developed and posted on four social media platforms. The data were only collected from those who consented to participate. COVIO score was classified into high vs. low using the asymmetrical distribution as a guide and conducted a binary logistic regression to examine the factors associated with COVIO.A total number of 584 respondents participated in this study. The mean COVIO score of the respondents was 19.4 (± 4.0). Sources and frequency of receiving COVID-19 information were found to be significant predictors of COVIO. Participants who received information via the broadcast media were more likely to have high COVIO than those who received information via the social media (adjusted odds ratio ([aOR],14.599; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.608-132.559; p = 0.017). Also, participants who received COVID-19 information every minute (aOR, 3.892; 95% CI, 1.124-13.480; p = 0.032) were more likely to have high COVIO than those who received information every week.The source of information and the frequency of receiving COVID-19 information were significantly associated with COVIO.

W3126378075,Prevalence of first adolescent pregnancy and its associated factors in sub-Saharan Africa: A multi-country analysis,"Introduction In low-and middle-income countries, pregnancy-related complications are major causes of death for young women. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of first adolescent pregnancy and its associated factors in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We undertook a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 32 sub-Saharan African countries between 2010 and 2018. We calculated the prevalence of first adolescent (aged 15 to 19 years) pregnancy in each country and examined associations between individual and contextual level factors and first adolescent pregnancy. Results Among all adolescents, Congo experienced the highest prevalence of first adolescent pregnancy (44.3%) and Rwanda the lowest (7.2%). However, among adolescents who had ever had sex, the prevalence ranged from 36.5% in Rwanda to 75.6% in Chad. The odds of first adolescent pregnancy was higher with increasing age, working, being married/cohabiting, having primary education only, early sexual initiation, knowledge of contraceptives, no unmet need for contraception and poorest wealth quintile. By contrast, adolescents who lived in rural areas and in the West African sub-region had lower odds of first adolescent pregnancy. Conclusion The prevalence of adolescent pregnancy in sub-Saharan African countries is high. Understanding the predictors of first adolescent pregnancy can facilitate the development of effective social policies such as family planning and comprehensive sex and relationship education in sub-Saharan Africa and can help ensure healthy lives and promotion of well-being for adolescents and their families and communities.",2021-02-04,2021,Bright Opoku Ahinkorah; Melissa Kang; Lin Perry; Fiona Brooks; Andrew Hayen,University of Technology Sydney,PLoS ONE,120,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246308,Defense_Security,Pregnancy; Medicine; Odds; Demography; Family planning,0.15
W3188860156,Epidemiology of injuries in male and female youth football players: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological data of injuries in male and female youth football players.Searches were performed in MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and SPORTDiscus databases. Studies were considered if they reported injury incidence rate in male and female youth (≤19 years old) football players. Two reviewers (FJRP and ALV) extracted data and assessed trial quality using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach determined the quality of evidence. Studies were combined using a Poisson random effects regression model.Forty-three studies were included. The overall incidence rate was 5.70 injuries/1000 h in males and 6.77 injuries/1000 h in females. Match injury incidence (14.43 injuries/1000 h in males and 14.97 injuries/1000 h in females) was significantly higher than training injury incidence (2.77 injuries/1000 h in males and 2.62 injuries/1000 h in females). The lower extremity had the highest incidence rate in both sexes. The most common type of injury was muscle/tendon for males and joint/ligament for females. Minimal injuries were the most common in both sexes. The incidence rate of injuries increased with advances in chronological age in males. Elite male players presented higher match injury incidence than sub-elite players. In females, there was a paucity of data for comparison across age groups and levels of play.The high injury incidence rates and sex differences identified for the most common location and type of injury reinforce the need for implementing different targeted injury-risk mitigation strategies in male and female youth football players.",2021-10-25,2021,Francisco Javier Robles-Palazón; Alejandro López‐Valenciano; Mark De Ste Croix; Jon L.

W4225249666,Effect of lockdown on mental health in Australia: evidence from a natural experiment analysing a longitudinal probability sample survey,"BackgroundMany studies have examined population mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic but have been unable to isolate the direct effect of lockdowns. The aim of this study was to examine changes in the mental health of Australians aged 15 years and older during the COVID-19 pandemic using a quasi-experimental design to disentangle the lockdown effect.MethodsWe analysed data from ten annual waves (2011–20) of the longitudinal Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey to identify changes in the mental health of respondents from the pre-COVID-19 period (2011–19) to the COVID-19 period (2020). Difference-in-differences models were used to compare these changes between respondents in the state of Victoria who were exposed to lockdown at the time of the 2020 interviews (treatment group) and respondents living elsewhere in Australia (who were living relatively free of restrictions; control group). The models included state, year (survey wave), and person-specific fixed effects. Mental health was assessed using the five-item Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5), which was included in the self-complete questionnaire administered during the survey.FindingsThe analysis sample comprised 151 583 observations obtained from 20 839 individuals from 2011 to 2020. The treatment group included 3568 individuals with a total of 37 578 observations (34 010 in the pre-COVID-19 and 3568 in the COVID-19 period), and the control group included 17 271 individuals with 114 005 observations (102 867 in the pre-COVID-19 and 11 138 in the COVID-19 period). Mean MHI-5 scores did not differ between the treatment group (72·9 points [95% CI 72·8–73·2]) and control group (73·2 points [73·1–73·3]) in the pre-COVID-19 period. In the COVID-19 period, decreased mean scores were seen in both the treatment group (69·6 points [69·0–70·2]) and control group (70·8 points [70·5–71·2]). Difference-in-differences estimation showed a small but statistically significant effect of lockdown on MHI-5 scores, with greater decline for residents of Victoria in 2020 than for those in the rest of Australia (difference –1·4 points [95% CI –1·7 to –1·2]). Stratified analyses showed that this lockdown effect was larger for females (−2·2 points [–2·6 to –1·7]) than for males (−0·6 [–0·8 to –0·5]), and even larger for women in couples with children younger than 15 years (−4·4 points [–5·0 to –3·8]), and for females who lived in flats or apartments (−4·1 points [–5·4 to –2·8]) or semi-detached houses, terraced houses, or townhouses (−4·8 points [–6·4 to –3·2]).InterpretationThe imposition of lockdowns was associated with a modest negative change in overall population mental health. The results suggest that the mental health effects of lockdowns differ by population subgroups and for some might have exaggerated existing inequalities in mental health. Although lockdowns have been an important public health tool in suppressing community transmission of COVID-19, more research is needed into the potential psychosocial impacts of such interventions to inform their future use.FundingUS National Institutes of Health.",2022-04-21,2022,Peter Butterworth; Stefanie Schurer; Trong‐Anh Trinh; Esperanza Vera‐Toscano; Mark Wooden,Australian National University,The Lancet Public Health,112,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2468-2667(22)00082-2,Defense_Security,Mental health; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Pandemic; Demography; Longitudinal study,0.225
W4312000417,A Review on Constraint Handling Techniques for Population-based Algorithms: from single-objective to multi-objective optimization,"Abstract Most real-world problems involve some type of optimization problems that are often constrained. Numerous researchers have investigated several techniques to deal with constrained single-objective and multi-objective evolutionary optimization in many fields, including theory and application. This presented study provides a novel analysis of scholarly literature on constraint-handling techniques for single-objective and multi-objective population-based algorithms according to the most relevant journals and articles. As a contribution to this study, the paper reviews the main ideas of the most state-of-the-art constraint handling techniques in population-based optimization, and then the study addresses the bibliometric analysis, with a focus on multi-objective, in the field. The extracted papers include research articles, reviews, book/book chapters, and conference papers published between 2000 and 2021 for analysis. The results indicate that the constraint-handling techniques for multi-objective optimization have received much less attention compared with single-objective optimization. The most promising algorithms for such optimization were determined to be genetic algorithms, differential evolutionary algorithms, and particle swarm intelligence. Additionally, “Engineering,” “Computer Science,” and “ Mathematics” were identified as the top three research fields in which future research work is anticipated to increase.",2022-12-09,2022,Iman Rahimi; Amir H.

W4317034991,Half a century of rising extinction risk of coral reef sharks and rays,"Abstract Sharks and rays are key functional components of coral reef ecosystems, yet many populations of a few species exhibit signs of depletion and local extinctions. The question is whether these declines forewarn of a global extinction crisis. We use IUCN Red List to quantify the status, trajectory, and threats to all coral reef sharks and rays worldwide. Here, we show that nearly two-thirds (59%) of the 134 coral-reef associated shark and ray species are threatened with extinction. Alongside marine mammals, sharks and rays are among the most threatened groups found on coral reefs. Overfishing is the main cause of elevated extinction risk, compounded by climate change and habitat degradation. Risk is greatest for species that are larger-bodied (less resilient and higher trophic level), widely distributed across several national jurisdictions (subject to a patchwork of management), and in nations with greater fishing pressure and weaker governance. Population declines have occurred over more than half a century, with greatest declines prior to 2005. Immediate action through local protections, combined with broad-scale fisheries management and Marine Protected Areas, is required to avoid extinctions and the loss of critical ecosystem function condemning reefs to a loss of shark and ray biodiversity and ecosystem services, limiting livelihoods and food security.",2023-01-17,2023,C.

W4225980882,Determinants of life expectancy in most polluted countries: Exploring the effect of environmental degradation,"Background Better understanding of the determinants of national life expectancy is crucial for economic development, as a healthy nation is a prerequisite for a wealthy nation. Many socioeconomic, nutritional, lifestyle, genetic and environmental factors can influence a nation’s health and longevity. Environmental degradation is one of the critical determinants of life expectancy, which is still under-researched, as the literature suggests. Objectives This study aims to investigate the determinants of life expectancy in 31 world’s most polluted countries with particular attention on environmental degradation using the World Bank annual data and British Petroleum data over the period of 18 years (2000–2017). Methods The empirical investigation is based on the model of Preston Curve, where panel corrected standard errors (PCSE) and feasible general least square (FGLS) estimates are employed to explore the long-run effects. Pairwise Granger causality test is also used to have short-run causality among the variables of interest, taking into account the cross-sectional dependence test and other essential diagnostic tests. Results The results confirm the existence of the Preston Curve, implying the positive effect of economic growth on life expectancy. Environmental degradation is found as a threat while health expenditure, clean water and improved sanitation affect the life expectancy positively in the sample countries. The causality test results reveal one-way causality from carbon emissions to life expectancy and bidirectional causalities between drinking water and life expectancy and sanitation and life expectancy. Conclusion Our results reveal that environmental degradation is a threat to having improved life expectancy in our sample countries. Based on the results of this study, we recommend that: (1) policy marker of these countries should adopt policies that will reduce carbon emissions and thus will improve public health and productivity; (2) environment-friendly technologies and resources, such as renewable energy, should be used in the production process; (3) healthcare expenditure on a national budget should be increased; and (4) clean drinking water and basic sanitation facilities must be ensured for all people.",2022-01-21,2022,Mohammad Mafizur Rahman; Rezwanul Hasan Rana; Rasheda Khanam,University of Southern Queensland,PLoS ONE,100,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262802,Defense_Security,Life expectancy; Environmental degradation; Sanitation; Panel data; Socioeconomic status,0.225
W4313827880,"European fitness landscape for children and adolescents: updated reference values, fitness maps and country rankings based on nearly 8 million test results from 34 countries gathered by the FitBack network","OBJECTIVES: (1) To develop reference values for health-related fitness in European children and adolescents aged 6-18 years that are the foundation for the web-based, open-access and multilanguage fitness platform (FitBack); (2) to provide comparisons across European countries. METHODS: This study builds on a previous large fitness reference study in European youth by (1) widening the age demographic, (2) identifying the most recent and representative country-level data and (3) including national data from existing fitness surveillance and monitoring systems. We used the Assessing Levels of PHysical Activity and fitness at population level (ALPHA) test battery as it comprises tests with the highest test-retest reliability, criterion/construct validity and health-related predictive validity: the 20 m shuttle run (cardiorespiratory fitness); handgrip strength and standing long jump (muscular strength); and body height, body mass, body mass index and waist circumference (anthropometry). Percentile values were obtained using the generalised additive models for location, scale and shape method. RESULTS: A total of 7 966 693 test results from 34 countries (106 datasets) were used to develop sex-specific and age-specific percentile values. In addition, country-level rankings based on mean percentiles are provided for each fitness test, as well as an overall fitness ranking. Finally, an interactive fitness platform, including individual and group reporting and European fitness maps, is provided and freely available online (www.fitbackeurope.eu). CONCLUSION: This study discusses the major implications of fitness assessment in youth from health, educational and sport perspectives, and how the FitBack reference values and interactive web-based platform contribute to it. Fitness testing can be conducted in school and/or sport settings, and the interpreted results be integrated in the healthcare systems across Europe.",2023-01-09,2023,Francisco B.

W4295242329,A New Census of the 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.0 Universe. II. The Star-forming Sequence,"Abstract We use the panchromatic spectral energy distribution (SED)-fitting code Prospector to measure the galaxy log M *–logSFR relationship (the star-forming sequence ) across 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.0 using the COSMOS-2015 and 3D-HST UV-IR photometric catalogs. We demonstrate that the chosen method of identifying star-forming galaxies introduces a systematic uncertainty in the inferred normalization and width of the star-forming sequence, peaking for massive galaxies at ∼0.5 and ∼0.2 dex, respectively. To avoid this systematic, we instead parameterize the density of the full galaxy population in the log M *–logSFR–redshift plane using a flexible neural network known as a normalizing flow. The resulting star-forming sequence has a low-mass slope near unity and a much flatter slope at higher masses, with a normalization 0.2–0.5 dex lower than typical inferences in the literature. We show this difference is due to the sophistication of the Prospector stellar populations modeling: the nonparametric star formation histories naturally produce higher masses while the combination of individualized metallicity, dust, and star formation history constraints produce lower star formation rates (SFRs) than typical UV+IR formulae. We introduce a simple formalism to understand the difference between SFRs inferred from SED fitting and standard template-based approaches such as UV+IR SFRs. Finally, we demonstrate the inferred star-forming sequence is consistent with predictions from theoretical models of galaxy formation, resolving a long-standing ∼ 0.2–0.5 dex offset with observations at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.

W4384469634,Successional theories,"ABSTRACT Succession is a fundamental concept in ecology because it indicates how species populations, communities, and ecosystems change over time on new substrate or after a disturbance. A mechanistic understanding of succession is needed to predict how ecosystems will respond to land‐use change and to design effective ecosystem restoration strategies. Yet, despite a century of conceptual advances a comprehensive successional theory is lacking. Here we provide an overview of 19 successional theories (‘models’) and their key points, group them based on conceptual similarity, explain conceptual development in successional ideas and provide suggestions how to move forward. Four groups of models can be recognised. The first group ( patch &amp; plants ) focuses on plants at the patch level and consists of three subgroups that originated in the early 20th century. One subgroup focuses on the processes (dispersal, establishment, and performance) that operate sequentially during succession. Another subgroup emphasises individualistic species responses during succession, and how this is driven by species traits. A last subgroup focuses on how vegetation structure and underlying demographic processes change during succession. A second group of models ( ecosystems ) provides a more holistic view of succession by considering the ecosystem, its biota, interactions, diversity, and ecosystem structure and processes. The third group ( landscape ) considers a larger spatial scale and includes the effect of the surrounding landscape matrix on succession as the distance to neighbouring vegetation patches determines the potential for seed dispersal, and the quality of the neighbouring patches determines the abundance and composition of seed sources and biotic dispersal vectors. A fourth group ( socio‐ecological systems ) includes the human component by focusing on socio‐ecological systems where management practices have long‐lasting legacies on successional pathways and where regrowing vegetations deliver a range of ecosystem services to local and global stakeholders. The four groups of models differ in spatial scale (patch, landscape) or organisational level (plant species, ecosystem, socio‐ecological system), increase in scale and scope, and reflect the increasingly broader perspective on succession over time. They coincide approximately with four periods that reflect the prevailing view of succession of that time, although all views still coexist. The four successional views are: succession of plants (from 1910 onwards) where succession was seen through the lens of species replacement; succession of communities and ecosystems (from 1965 onwards) when there was a more holistic view of succession; succession in landscapes (from 2000 onwards) when it was realised that the structure and composition of landscapes strongly impact successional pathways, and increased remote‐sensing technology allowed for a better quantification of the landscape context; and succession with people (from 2015 onwards) when it was realised that people and societal drivers have strong effects on successional pathways, that ecosystem processes and services are important for human well‐being, and that restoration is most successful when it is done by and for local people. Our review suggests that the hierarchical successional framework of Pickett is the best starting point to move forward as this framework already includes several factors, and because it is flexible, enabling application to different systems. The framework focuses mainly on species replacement and could be improved by focusing on succession occurring at different hierarchical scales (population, community, ecosystem, socio‐ecological system), and by integrating it with more recent developments and other successional models: by considering different spatial scales (landscape, region), temporal scales (ecosystem processes occurring over centuries, and evolution), and by taking the effects of the surrounding landscape (landscape integrity and composition, the disperser community) and societal factors (previous and current land‐use intensity) into account. Such a new, comprehensive framework could be tested using a combination of empirical research, experiments, process‐based modelling and novel tools. Applying the framework to seres across broadscale environmental and disturbance gradients allows a better insight into what successional processes matter and under what conditions.",2023-07-16,2023,Lourens Poorter; Lucy Amissah; Frans Bongers; Iris Hordijk; Jazz Kok,James Cook University,Biological reviews/Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,93,https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12995,Defense_Security,Ecological succession; Ecology; Biological dispersal; Ecosystem; Vegetation (pathology),0.3
W4394689630,Cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong and consistent predictor of morbidity and mortality among adults: an overview of meta-analyses representing over 20.9 million observations from 199 unique cohort studies,"Objective To examine and summarise evidence from meta-analyses of cohort studies that evaluated the predictive associations between baseline cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and health outcomes among adults. Design Overview of systematic reviews. Data source Five bibliographic databases were searched from January 2002 to March 2024. Results From the 9062 papers identified, we included 26 systematic reviews. We found eight meta-analyses that described five unique mortality outcomes among general populations. CRF had the largest risk reduction for all-cause mortality when comparing high versus low CRF (HR=0.47; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.56). A dose–response relationship for every 1-metabolic equivalent of task (MET) higher level of CRF was associated with a 11%–17% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR=0.89; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.92, and HR=0.83; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.88). For incident outcomes, nine meta-analyses described 12 unique outcomes. CRF was associated with the largest risk reduction in incident heart failure when comparing high versus low CRF (HR=0.31; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.49). A dose–response relationship for every 1-MET higher level of CRF was associated with a 18% reduction in heart failure (HR=0.82; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.84). Among those living with chronic conditions, nine meta-analyses described four unique outcomes in nine patient groups. CRF was associated with the largest risk reduction for cardiovascular mortality among those living with cardiovascular disease when comparing high versus low CRF (HR=0.27; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.48). The certainty of the evidence across all studies ranged from very low-to-moderate according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations.

W4292962346,"The Theoretical, Practical, and Technological Foundations of the 15-Minute City Model: Proximity and Its Environmental, Social and Economic Benefits for Sustainability","Conventional and emerging paradigms of urbanism require new responses under the current circumstances, especially in relation to the integration of sustainability dimensions and technology advances. The escalating rate of urbanization, coupled with the climate emergency, fundamentally indeed disrupt the challenges that urbanism research and practice deal with, calling for adopting more innovative approaches to urban planning and design. With cities contributing around 65% of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and experiencing an unprecedented growth of population, contemporary urban policy needs to be redefined and re-assessed accordingly. While numerous urban models, such as the Compact City, the Eco-City, the Sustainable City, and the Smart City, have emerged in response to the challenges of sustainability and urbanization, the 15-Minute City has recently gained a steep popularity. This paper explores the theoretical, practical, and technological foundations of the 15-Minute City, with a particular focus on the proximity dimension of mixed land-use and its environmental, social, and economic benefits of sustainability as supported by smart technologies. We argue that this evolving model of urbanism has the potential to gain more expansion and success in regard to building more sustainable, efficient, resilient, equitable, and inclusive cities in line with the global agendas of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, as it adds a strategic value to the amalgam of the prevailing and emerging paradigms of urbanism and their synergies with respect to increasing the benefits of sustainability while emphasizing its environmental dimension.",2022-08-20,2022,Zaheer Allam; Simon Elias Bibri; Didier Chabaud; Carlos Moreno,Deakin University,Energies,85,https://doi.org/10.3390/en15166042,Defense_Security,Sustainability; Urbanism; Urbanization; Smart growth; Sustainable city,0.225

Here, we outline the Grambank database. With over 400,000 data points and 2400 languages, Grambank is the largest comparative grammatical database available. The comprehensiveness of Grambank allows us to quantify the relative effects of genealogical inheritance and geographic proximity on the structural diversity of the world's languages, evaluate constraints on linguistic diversity, and identify the world's most unusual languages.

W4361284867,The prevalence of hip osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Objective To estimate the global prevalence of hip osteoarthritis (HOA) through a systematic review and meta-analysis, and to determine by regression analysis the respective relationships between age and sex, and sex and prevalence. Methods EMBASE, PubMed, Web of science, CINAHL, and SCOPUS were searched from inception until August 2022. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of the retrieved literature. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed to derive the pooled prevalence. Variations in the prevalence estimate in different subgroups, including diagnostic methods, region, and patient sex, were examined by subgroup meta-analysis. Meta-regression was used to construct the age-specific prevalence of HOA. Results A total of 31 studies were included in our analysis, involving 326,463 participants. Quality evaluation showed that all studies included in the analysis had a Quality Score of at least 4. The most frequently used method for diagnosing HOA was the Kellgren–Lawrence (K-L) grade classification, accounting for 19/31 (61.3%) studies. The pooled prevalence of HOA diagnosed based on the K-L grade ≥ 2 criterion was 8.55% (95% CI 4.85–13.18) worldwide. The prevalence of HOA was lowest in Africa at 1.20% (95% CI: 0.40–2.38), followed by Asia at 4.26% (95% CI 0.02–14.93) and North America at 7.95% (95% CI 1.98–17.36), and highest in Europe at 12.59% (95% CI 7.17–19.25). There was no statistically significant difference in HOA prevalence between men (9.42%, 95% CI:4.81–15.34) and women at (7.94%, 95% CI: 3.57–13.81).

W4220823139,Energy Security and Energy Poverty in Emerging Economies: A Step Towards Sustainable Energy Efficiency,"This paper presents the energy security, energy poverty, and mediating role of environmental tax policy. The environmental tax policy affects energy consumption and energy poverty. The research applied multiple, comprehensive, and relevant sets of indicators to measure energy security, energy poverty, and environmental consideration of energy poverty through environmental tax. The study used a mathematical composite indicator and an econometric estimation to conduct an empirical estimation. The study used annual data from 1990 to 2018 and concluded that long-run associations between energy security, energy poverty, and environmental tax have been characterized by the linear and asymmetric association to specify hidden cointegration behavior among the trilemma. The results show how policymakers have clouded the decision to implement appropriate energy security to mitigate energy poverty in Vietnam through environmental tax.Results show that from 2001 to 2016 in Vietnam, energy security was low and energy poverty was high, but after 2016, it can be seen that there is a dramatic change in energy security and energy poverty. The year 2018 shows the highest energy security index score (0.92) and the lowest energy poverty index score (0.12).

W4315796472,Denser and greener cities: Green interventions to achieve both urban density and nature,"Abstract Green spaces in urban areas—like remnant habitat, parks, constructed wetlands, and street trees—supply multiple benefits. Many studies show green spaces in and near urban areas play important roles harbouring biodiversity and promoting human well‐being. On the other hand, evidence suggests that greater human population density enables compact, low‐carbon cities that spare habitat conversion at the fringes of expanding urban areas, while also allowing more walkable and livable cities. How then can urban areas have abundant green spaces as well as density? In this paper, we review the empirical evidence for the relationships between urban density, nature, and sustainability. We also present a quantitative analysis of data on urban tree canopy cover and open space for United States large urbanized areas, as well as an analysis of non‐US Functional Urban Areas in OECD countries. We found that there is a negative correlation between population density and these green spaces. For Functional Urban Areas in the OECD, a 10% increase in density is associated with a 2.9% decline in tree cover. We argue that there are competing trade‐offs between the benefits of density for sustainability and the benefits of nature for human well‐being. Planners must decide an appropriate density by choosing where to be on this trade‐off curve, taking into account city‐specific urban planning goals and context. However, while the negative correlation between population density and tree cover is modest at the level of US urbanized areas ( R 2 = 0.22), it is weak at the US Census block level ( R 2 = 0.05), showing that there are significant brightspots, neighbourhoods that manage to have more tree canopy than would be expected based upon their level of density. We then describe techniques for how urban planners and designers can create more brightspots, identifying a typology of urban forms and listing green interventions appropriate for each form. We also analyse policies that enable these green interventions illustrating them with the case studies of Curitiba and Singapore. We conclude that while there are tensions between density and urban green spaces, an urban world that is both green and dense is possible, if society chooses to take advantage of the available green interventions and create it.

W4379740676,"Locally led adaptation: Promise, pitfalls, and possibilities","Locally led adaptation (LLA) has recently gained importance against top-down planning practices that often exclude the lived realities and priorities of local communities and create injustices at the local level. The promise of LLA is that adaptation would be defined, prioritised, designed, monitored, and evaluated by local communities themselves, enabling a shift in power to local stakeholders, resulting in more effective adaptation interventions. Critical reflections on the intersections of power and justice in LLA are, however, lacking. This article offers a nuanced understanding of the power and justice considerations required to make LLA useful for local communities and institutions, and to resolve the tensions between LLA and other development priorities. It also contributes to a further refinement of LLA methodologies and practices to better realise its promises. Ultimately, we argue that the utility of the LLA framing in promoting climate justice and empowering local actors needs to be tested empirically.",2023-06-07,2023,M.

W4321791279,A thousand-genome panel retraces the global spread and adaptation of a major fungal crop pathogen,"Abstract Human activity impacts the evolutionary trajectories of many species worldwide. Global trade of agricultural goods contributes to the dispersal of pathogens reshaping their genetic makeup and providing opportunities for virulence gains. Understanding how pathogens surmount control strategies and cope with new climates is crucial to predicting the future impact of crop pathogens. Here, we address this by assembling a global thousand-genome panel of Zymoseptoria tritici , a major fungal pathogen of wheat reported in all production areas worldwide. We identify the global invasion routes and ongoing genetic exchange of the pathogen among wheat-growing regions. We find that the global expansion was accompanied by increased activity of transposable elements and weakened genomic defenses. Finally, we find significant standing variation for adaptation to new climates encountered during the global spread. Our work shows how large population genomic panels enable deep insights into the evolutionary trajectory of a major crop pathogen.",2023-02-24,2023,Alice Feurtey; Cécile Lorrain; Megan C.

W4365795982,Marine turtle regional management units 2.0: an updated framework for conservation and research of wide-ranging megafauna species,"Delineating spatial boundaries that accurately encompass complex, often cryptic, life histories of highly migratory marine megafauna can be a significant conservation challenge. For example, marine turtles range across vast ocean basins and coastal areas, thus complicating the evaluation of relative impacts of multiple overlapping threats and the creation of coherent conservation strategies. To address these challenges, spatially explicit ‘regional management units’ (RMUs) were developed in 2010 for all marine turtle species, globally. RMUs were intended to provide a consistent framework that organizes conspecific assemblages into units above the level of nesting rookeries and genetic stocks, but below the species level, within regional entities that may share demographic trajectories because they experience similar environmental conditions and other factors. From their initial conception, RMUs were intended to be periodically revised using new information about marine turtle distributions, life history, habitat use patterns, and population structure. Here, we describe the process used to update the 2010 RMU framework by incorporating newly published information and inputs from global marine turtle experts who are members of the IUCN Marine Turtle Specialist Group. A total of 48 RMUs for 6 of 7 marine turtle species and 166 distinct genetic stocks for all 7 species are presented herein. The updated RMU framework reflects a significant advance in knowledge of marine turtle biology and biogeography, and it provides improved clarity about the RMU concept and its potential applications.

W4385240473,JWST UNCOVER: Extremely Red and Compact Object at z <sub>phot</sub> ≃ 7.6 Triply Imaged by A2744,"Abstract Recent JWST/NIRCam imaging taken for the ultra-deep UNCOVER program reveals a very red dropout object at z phot ≃ 7.6, triply imaged by the galaxy cluster A2744 ( z d = 0.308). All three images are very compact, i.e., unresolved, with a delensed size upper limit of r e ≲ 35 pc. The images have apparent magnitudes of m F444W ∼ 25−26 AB, and the magnification-corrected absolute UV magnitude of the source is M UV,1450 = −16.81 ± 0.09. From the sum of observed fluxes and from a spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis, we obtain estimates of the bolometric luminosities of the source of L bol ≳ 10 43 erg s −1 and L bol ∼ 10 44 –10 46 erg s −1 , respectively. Based on its compact, point-like appearance, its position in color–color space, and the SED analysis, we tentatively conclude that this object is a UV-faint dust-obscured quasar-like object, i.e., an active galactic nucleus at high redshift. We also discuss other alternative origins for the object’s emission features, including a massive star cluster, Population III, supermassive, or dark stars, or a direct-collapse black hole. Although populations of red galaxies at similar photometric redshifts have been detected with JWST, this object is unique in that its high-redshift nature is corroborated geometrically by lensing, that it is unresolved despite being magnified—and thus intrinsically even more compact—and that it occupies notably distinct regions in both size–luminosity and color–color space. Planned UNCOVER JWST/NIRSpec observations, scheduled in Cycle 1, will enable a more detailed analysis of this object.",2023-07-25,2023,Lukas J.

W4313681586,Velocity pausing particle swarm optimization: a novel variant for global optimization,"Abstract Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the most well-regard metaheuristics with remarkable performance when solving diverse optimization problems. However, PSO faces two main problems that degrade its performance: slow convergence and local optima entrapment. In addition, the performance of this algorithm substantially degrades on high-dimensional problems. In the classical PSO, particles can move in each iteration with either slower or faster speed. This work proposes a novel idea called velocity pausing where particles in the proposed velocity pausing PSO (VPPSO) variant are supported by a third movement option that allows them to move with the same velocity as they did in the previous iteration. As a result, VPPSO has a higher potential to balance exploration and exploitation. To avoid the PSO premature convergence, VPPSO modifies the first term of the PSO velocity equation. In addition, the population of VPPSO is divided into two swarms to maintain diversity. The performance of VPPSO is validated on forty three benchmark functions and four real-world engineering problems. According to the Wilcoxon rank-sum and Friedman tests, VPPSO can significantly outperform seven prominent algorithms on most of the tested functions on both low- and high-dimensional cases. Due to its superior performance in solving complex high-dimensional problems, VPPSO can be applied to solve diverse real-world optimization problems. Moreover, the velocity pausing concept can be easily integrated with new or existing metaheuristic algorithms to enhance their performances.

W4362506797,Squid Game Optimizer (SGO): a novel metaheuristic algorithm,"In this paper, Squid Game Optimizer (SGO) is proposed as a novel metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the primary rules of a traditional Korean game. Squid game is a multiplayer game with two primary objectives: attackers aim to complete their goal while teams try to eliminate each other, and it is usually played on large, open fields with no set guidelines for size and dimensions. The playfield for this game is often shaped like a squid and, according to historical context, appears to be around half the size of a standard basketball court. The mathematical model of this algorithm is developed based on a population of solution candidates with a random initialization process in the first stage. The solution candidates are divided into two groups of offensive and defensive players while the offensive player goes among the defensive players to start a fight which is modeled through a random movement toward the defensive players. By considering the winning states of the players of both sides which is calculated based on the objective function, the position updating process is conducted and the new position vectors are produced. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SGO algorithm, 25 unconstrained mathematical test functions with 100 dimensions are used, alongside six other commonly used metaheuristics for comparison. 100 independent optimization runs are conducted for both SGO and the other algorithms with a pre-determined stopping condition to ensure statistical significance of the results. Statistical metrics such as mean, standard deviation, and mean of required objective function evaluations are calculated. To provide a more comprehensive analysis, four prominent statistical tests including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests are used. Meanwhile, the ability of the suggested SGOA is assessed through the cutting-edge real-world problems on the newest CEC like CEC 2020, while the SGO demonstrate outstanding performance in dealing with these complex optimization problems. The overall assessment of the SGO indicates that the proposed algorithm can provide competitive and remarkable outcomes in both benchmark and real-world problems.",2023-04-01,2023,Mahdi Azizi; Milad Baghalzadeh Shishehgarkhaneh; Mahla Basiri; Robert Moehler,Monash University,Scientific Reports,56,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32465-z,Defense_Security,Offensive; Computer science; Metaheuristic; Algorithm; Context (archaeology),0.15
W4388865347,Prevalence and factors associated with anemia in women of reproductive age across low- and middle-income countries based on national data,"Anemia is a global threat among women of reproductive age (WRA), or 15-49 years old women, both in developed and developing countries. Prevalence of anemia in WRA is higher by fourfold in developing countries, based on extensive studies and surveys conducted by WHO and UNICEF. However, there is limited studies that conducted pooled analysis of anemia prevalence in low resource countries. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with anemia among women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study used secondary data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in 46 low- and middle-income countries during 2010-2021. Descriptive statistics of proportions between pregnant and non-pregnant mothers were assessed. Multilevel binary logistic regression was used to test the factors associated with anemia among women of reproductive age. A total of 881,148 women of childbearing age in LMICs were included. This study found a high prevalence of 45.20% (95% CI 41.21, 49.16) of anemia was observed in among pregnant women and 39.52% (95% CI 33.88, 45.15) anemia was observed in non-pregnant women. Educational status, wealth status, family size, media exposure, and residence were common factors significantly associated with anemia in both pregnant and non-pregnant women. The high global burden of anemia in LMICs continues to underline the need for unusual approaches and target interventions on an individual basis.

W4313547187,"Cannabis legalization and cannabis use, daily cannabis use and cannabis-related problems among adults in Ontario, Canada (2001–2019)","In the context of cannabis legalization in Canada, we examined the effects on cannabis patterns of consumption, including cannabis use, daily cannabis use and cannabis-related problems. In addition, we examined differential effects of cannabis legalization by age and sex. A pre-post design was operationalized by combining 19 iterations of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) Monitor Surveys (N = 52,260; 2001–2019): repeated, population-based, cross-sectional surveys of adults in Ontario. Participants provided self-reports of cannabis use (past 12 months), daily cannabis use (past 12 months) and cannabis-related problems though telephone interviews. The effects of cannabis legalization on cannabis patterns of consumption were examined using logistic regression analyses, with testing of two-way interactions to determine differential effects by age and sex. Cannabis use prevalence increased from 11 % to 26 % (p < 0.0001), daily cannabis use prevalence increased from 1 % to 6 % (p < 0.0001) and cannabis-related problems prevalence increased from 6 % to 14 % (p < 0.0001) between 2001 and 2019. Cannabis legalization was associated with an increased likelihood of cannabis use (OR, 95 % CI: 1.62, 1.40–1.86), daily cannabis use (1.59, 1.21–2.07) and cannabis-related problems (1.53, 1.20–1.95). For cannabis-related problems, a significant two-way interaction was observed between cannabis legalization and age (p = 0.0001), suggesting differential effects among adults ≥55 years. Cannabis legalization was associated with an increased likelihood of cannabis use, daily cannabis use and cannabis-related problems.

W4385725647,Ensemble machine learning-based recommendation system for effective prediction of suitable agricultural crop cultivation,"Agriculture is the most critical sector for food supply on the earth, and it is also responsible for supplying raw materials for other industrial productions. Currently, the growth in agricultural production is not sufficient to keep up with the growing population, which may result in a food shortfall for the world’s inhabitants. As a result, increasing food production is crucial for developing nations with limited land and resources. It is essential to select a suitable crop for a specific region to increase its production rate. Effective crop production forecasting in that area based on historical data, including environmental and cultivation areas, and crop production amount, is required. However, the data for such forecasting are not publicly available. As such, in this paper, we take a case study of a developing country, Bangladesh, whose economy relies on agriculture. We first gather and preprocess the data from the relevant research institutions of Bangladesh and then propose an ensemble machine learning approach, called K-nearest Neighbor Random Forest Ridge Regression (KRR), to effectively predict the production of the major crops (three different kinds of rice, potato, and wheat). KRR is designed after investigating five existing traditional machine learning (Support Vector Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Ridge Regression) and ensemble learning (Random Forest and CatBoost) algorithms. We consider four classical evaluation metrics, i.e., mean absolute error, mean square error (MSE), root MSE, and R 2 , to evaluate the performance of the proposed KRR over the other machine learning models. It shows 0.009 MSE, 99% R 2 for Aus; 0.92 MSE, 90% R 2 for Aman; 0.246 MSE, 99% R 2 for Boro; 0.062 MSE, 99% R 2 for wheat; and 0.016 MSE, 99% R 2 for potato production prediction. The Diebold–Mariano test is conducted to check the robustness of the proposed ensemble model, KRR. In most cases, it shows 1% and 5% significance compared to the benchmark ML models. Lastly, we design a recommender system that suggests suitable crops for a specific land area for cultivation in the next season. We believe that the proposed paradigm will help the farmers and personnel in the agricultural sector leverage proper crop cultivation and production.",2023-08-10,2023,Mahmudul Hasan; Md.

W4379741036,"Board demographic, structural diversity, and eco‐innovation: International evidence","Abstract Research question/issue We examine whether and how board diversity, measured by demographics (i.e., board gender, cultural diversity, tenure, social capital, expertise, and age) and structural diversity (i.e., board independence, size, board seat accumulation‐chair, board compensation, and board meeting frequency), influence corporate eco‐innovation. Research findings/insights Utilizing a global sample of publicly listed companies for the period 2004–2019, we find that a one‐standard deviation increase in demographic and structural diversity translates into 4.66% and 7.11% higher corporate eco‐innovation, respectively. Furthermore, we discover that demographic and structural diversity promotes eco‐innovation by offsetting the negative effects of political risk. In an additional analysis, we find evidence that, in the absence of greater external monitoring (institutional investors and analyst following), organizations benefit more from the monitoring role of board diversity. Theoretical/academic implications By adopting the concept of “bundling the governance mechanisms,” our study adds to the ongoing discourse about the function of board diversity in addressing corporate climate footprints by offering original evidence that board diversity heterogeneity—demographic and structural diversity—matters for corporate eco‐innovation.

W4392368994,Burden of Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke Across the US From 1990 to 2019,"Importance Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the US. Accurate and updated measures of stroke burden are needed to guide public health policies. Objective To present burden estimates of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in the US in 2019 and describe trends from 1990 to 2019 by age, sex, and geographic location. Design, Setting, and Participants An in-depth cross-sectional analysis of the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study was conducted. The setting included the time period of 1990 to 2019 in the US. The study encompassed estimates for various types of strokes, including all strokes, ischemic strokes, intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs), and subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAHs). The 2019 Global Burden of Disease results were released on October 20, 2020. Exposures In this study, no particular exposure was specifically targeted. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary focus of this analysis centered on both overall and age-standardized estimates, stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs per 100 000 individuals. Results In 2019, the US recorded 7.09 million prevalent strokes (4.07 million women [57.4%]; 3.02 million men [42.6%]), with 5.87 million being ischemic strokes (82.7%). Prevalence also included 0.66 million ICHs and 0.85 million SAHs. Although the absolute numbers of stroke cases, mortality, and DALYs surged from 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized rates either declined or remained steady. Notably, hemorrhagic strokes manifested a substantial increase, especially in mortality, compared with ischemic strokes (incidence of ischemic stroke increased by 13% [95% uncertainty interval (UI), 14.2%-11.9%]; incidence of ICH increased by 39.8% [95% UI, 38.9%-39.7%]; incidence of SAH increased by 50.9% [95% UI, 49.2%-52.6%]). The downturn in stroke mortality plateaued in the recent decade. There was a discernible heterogeneity in stroke burden trends, with older adults (50-74 years) experiencing a decrease in incidence in coastal areas (decreases up to 3.9% in Vermont), in contrast to an uptick observed in younger demographics (15-49 years) in the South and Midwest US (with increases up to 8.4% in Minnesota). Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study, the declining age-standardized stroke rates over the past 3 decades suggest progress in managing stroke-related outcomes. However, the increasing absolute burden of stroke, coupled with a notable rise in hemorrhagic stroke, suggests an evolving and substantial public health challenge in the US. Moreover, the significant disparities in stroke burden trends across different age groups and geographic locations underscore the necessity for region- and demography-specific interventions and policies to effectively mitigate the multifaceted and escalating burden of stroke in the country.",2024-03-04,2024,Daniela Renedo; Julián Acosta; Audrey C.

Seafaring simulations demonstrate that a northern equatorial route into New Guinea via the Raja Ampat Islands was a viable dispersal corridor to Sahul at this time.

W4392950737,"Population structure and migration in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, a region impacted by the kuru epidemic","Populations of the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea (EHPNG, area 11,157 km2) lived in relative isolation from the rest of the world until the mid-20th century, and the region contains a wealth of linguistic and cultural diversity. Notably, several populations of EHPNG were devastated by an epidemic prion disease, kuru, which at its peak in the mid-twentieth century led to some villages being almost depleted of adult women. Until now, population genetic analyses to learn about genetic diversity, migration, admixture, and the impact of the kuru epidemic have been restricted to a small number of variants or samples. Here, we present a population genetic analysis of the region based on genome-wide genotype data of 943 individuals from 21 linguistic groups and 68 villages in EHPNG, including 34 villages in the South Fore linguistic group, the group most affected by kuru. We find a striking degree of genetic population structure in the relatively small region (average FST between linguistic groups 0.024). The genetic population structure correlates well with linguistic grouping, with some noticeable exceptions that reflect the clan system of community organization that has historically existed in EHPNG. We also detect the presence of migrant individuals within the EHPNG region and observe a significant excess of females among migrants compared to among non-migrants in areas of high kuru exposure (p = 0.0145, chi-squared test). This likely reflects the continued practice of patrilocality despite documented fears and strains placed on communities as a result of kuru and its associated skew in female incidence.",2024-03-19,2024,Liam Quinn; Jerome Whitfield; Michael P.

W4392293923,"Quantifying the Effects of Known Unknowns on Inferred High-redshift Galaxy Properties: Burstiness, IMF, and Nebular Physics","Abstract The era of the James Webb Space Telescope ushers stellar population models into uncharted territories, particularly at the high-redshift frontier. In a companion paper, we apply the Prospector Bayesian framework to jointly infer galaxy redshifts and stellar population properties from broadband photometry as part of the UNCOVER survey. Here we present a comprehensive error budget in spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Using a sample selected to have photometric redshifts higher than 9, we quantify the systematic shifts stemming from various model choices in inferred stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and age. These choices encompass different timescales for changes in the star formation history (SFH), nonuniversal stellar initial mass functions (IMF), and the inclusion of variable nebular abundances, gas density, and ionizing photon budget. We find that the IMF exerts the strongest influence on the inferred properties: the systematic uncertainties can be as much as 1 dex, 2–5 times larger than the formal reported uncertainties in mass and SFR, and importantly, exceed the scatter seen when using different SED fitting codes. Although the assumptions on the lower end of the IMF induce degeneracy, our findings suggest that a common practice in the literature of assessing uncertainties in SED-fitting processes by comparing multiple codes is substantively underestimating the true systematic uncertainty. Highly stochastic SFHs change the inferred SFH by much larger than the formal uncertainties, and introduce ∼0.8 dex systematics in SFR averaged over a short timescale and ∼0.3 dex systematics in average age. Finally, employing a flexible nebular emission model causes ∼0.2 dex systematic increase in mass and SFR, comparable to the formal uncertainty. This paper constitutes an initial step toward a complete uncertainty estimate in SED modeling.",2024-02-29,2024,Bingjie Wang; Joel Leja; Hakim Atek; Ivo Labbé; Yijia Li,Swinburne University of Technology,The Astrophysical Journal,35,https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad187c,Defense_Security,Physics; Astrophysics; Redshift; Star formation; Galaxy,0.225
W4392391143,Bellwethers of change: population modelling of North Pacific humpback whales from 2002 through 2021 reveals shift from recovery to climate response,"For the 40 years after the end of commercial whaling in 1976, humpback whale populations in the North Pacific Ocean exhibited a prolonged period of recovery. Using mark–recapture methods on the largest individual photo-identification dataset ever assembled for a cetacean, we estimated annual ocean-basin-wide abundance for the species from 2002 through 2021. Trends in annual estimates describe strong post-whaling era population recovery from 16 875 (± 5955) in 2002 to a peak abundance estimate of 33 488 (± 4455) in 2012. An apparent 20% decline from 2012 to 2021, 33 488 (± 4455) to 26 662 (± 4192), suggests the population abruptly reached carrying capacity due to loss of prey resources. This was particularly evident for humpback whales wintering in Hawai‘i, where, by 2021, estimated abundance had declined by 34% from a peak in 2013, down to abundance levels previously seen in 2006, and contrasted to an absence of decline in Mainland Mexico breeding humpbacks. The strongest marine heatwave recorded globally to date during the 2014–2016 period appeared to have altered the course of species recovery, with enduring effects. Extending this time series will allow humpback whales to serve as an indicator species for the ecosystem in the face of a changing climate.",2024-02-01,2024,Ted Cheeseman; Jay Barlow; Jo Marie Acebes; Katherina Audley; Lars Bejder,Southern Cross University,Royal Society Open Science,30,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.231462,Defense_Security,Whaling; Abundance (ecology); Climate change; Population; Fishery,0.225
W4390574853,Frailty increases the long-term risk for fall and fracture-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality in community-dwelling older women,"Frailty is associated with declines in physiological capacity across sensory, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. An underlying assumption is that the frailer an individual, the more likely they are to experience falls and fractures. We examined whether grades of frailty can assess the long-term risk of hospitalized falls, fractures, and all-cause mortality in 1261 community-dwelling older women (mean age [SD] of 75.1 [2.7] yr) over 14.5 yr. Frailty was operationalized using a frailty index (FI) of cumulative deficits from 33 variables across multiple health domains (physical, mental, comorbidities) at baseline. The total score across these variables was summed and divided by 33 to obtain the FI. Participants were graded as fit (FI ≤ 0.12), mildly frail (FI > 0.12-0.24), moderately frail (FI > 0.24-0.36), or severely frail (FI > 0.36). Fall-related (n = 498), any fracture-related (n = 347), and hip fracture-related hospitalizations (n = 137) and deaths (n = 482) were obtained from linked health records. Associations between FI grades and clinical outcomes were analyzed using multivariable-adjusted Cox-proportional hazard models including age, treatment (calcium/placebo), BMI, smoking history, socioeconomic status, plasma vitamin D (25OHD) status plus season obtained, physical activity, self-reported prevalent falls in the last 3 mo, and self-reported fractures since the age of 50 yr. At baseline, 713 (56.5%), 350 (27.8%), 163 (12.9%), and 35 (2.8%) of women were classified as fit, mildly frail, moderately frail, and severely frail, respectively. Women with mild, moderate, and severe frailty had significantly higher hazards (all P < .05) for a fall-related (46%, 104%, 168%), any fracture-related (88% for moderate, 193% for severe frailty), hip fracture-related hospitalizations (93%, 127%, 129%), and all-cause mortality (47%, 126%, 242%). The FI identified community-dwelling older women at risk for the most serious falls and fractures and may be incorporated into risk assessment tools to identify individuals with poorer clinical prognosis.",2024-01-02,2024,Elsa Dent; Jack Dalla Via; Trent Bozanich; Emiel O.

W4392240157,Marine protected areas promote stability of reef fish communities under climate warming,"Abstract Protection from direct human impacts can safeguard marine life, yet ocean warming crosses marine protected area boundaries. Here, we test whether protection offers resilience to marine heatwaves from local to network scales. We examine 71,269 timeseries of population abundances for 2269 reef fish species surveyed in 357 protected versus 747 open sites worldwide. We quantify the stability of reef fish abundance from populations to metacommunities, considering responses of species and functional diversity including thermal affinity of different trophic groups. Overall, protection mitigates adverse effects of marine heatwaves on fish abundance, community stability, asynchronous fluctuations and functional richness. We find that local stability is positively related to distance from centers of high human density only in protected areas. We provide evidence that networks of protected areas have persistent reef fish communities in warming oceans by maintaining large populations and promoting stability at different levels of biological organization.",2024-02-28,2024,Lisandro Benedetti‐Cecchi; Amanda E.

W3082647986,Prevalence and Socio-Demographic Predictors of Food Insecurity in Australia during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated economic vulnerabilities and disrupted the Australian food supply, with potential implications for food insecurity. This study aims to describe the prevalence and socio-demographic associations of food insecurity in Tasmania, Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey (deployed late May to early June 2020) incorporated the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module: Six-Item Short Form, and fifteen demographic and COVID-related income questions. Survey data (n = 1170) were analyzed using univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression. The prevalence of food insecurity was 26%. The adjusted odds of food insecurity were higher among respondents with a disability, from a rural area, and living with dependents. Increasing age, a university education, and income above $80,000/year were protective against food insecurity. Food insecurity more than doubled with a loss of household income above 25% (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 2.02; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.71; p = 0.022), and the odds further increased with loss of income above 75% (AOR: 7.14; 95% CI: 2.01, 24.83; p = 0.002). Our results suggest that the prevalence of food insecurity may have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among economically vulnerable households and people who lost income.

W3012928138,"The relationship between problem gambling, excessive gaming, psychological distress and spending on loot boxes in Aotearoa New Zealand, Australia, and the United States—A cross-national survey","Loot boxes are digital containers of randomised rewards available in many video games. Due to similarities between some loot boxes and traditional forms of gambling, concerns regarding the relationship between spending on loot boxes in video games and symptoms of problematic gambling have been expressed by policy makers and the general public. We present the first investigation of these concerns in large cross-sectional cross-national samples from three countries (Aotearoa New Zealand, Australia, and the United States). A sample of 1,049 participants were recruited through Qualtrics' Survey Targeting service from a broad cross-section of the population in Australia (n = 339), Aotearoa New Zealand (n = 323), and the United States (n = 387). Participants answered a survey assessing problem gambling, problem gaming symptomology, and how much they spent on loot boxes per month. On average, individuals with problem gambling issues spent approximately $13 USD per month more on loot boxes than those with no such symptoms. Loot box spending was also associated with both positive and negative moods, albeit with small effect sizes. Analyses showed both interactions and correlations between problematic gambling and problematic gaming symptoms, indicating both some commonality in the mechanisms underlying, and independent contributions made by, these proposed diagnostic criteria. These results provide context for dialogues regarding how best to reduce the impacts of loot box spending among those with problematic gambling symptoms.",2020-03-23,2020,Aaron Drummond; James D.

W3032857945,How can airborne transmission of COVID-19 indoors be minimised?,"During the rapid rise in COVID-19 illnesses and deaths globally, and notwithstanding recommended precautions, questions are voiced about routes of transmission for this pandemic disease. Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public.",2020-05-27,2020,Lídia Morawska; Julian W.

W3136312839,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on utilisation of healthcare services: a systematic review,"Objectives To determine the extent and nature of changes in utilisation of healthcare services during COVID-19 pandemic. Design Systematic review. Eligibility Eligible studies compared utilisation of services during COVID-19 pandemic to at least one comparable period in prior years. Services included visits, admissions, diagnostics and therapeutics. Studies were excluded if from single centres or studied only patients with COVID-19. Data sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and preprints were searched, without language restrictions, until 10 August, using detailed searches with key concepts including COVID-19, health services and impact. Data analysis Risk of bias was assessed by adapting the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool, and a Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care tool. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics, graphical figures and narrative synthesis. Outcome measures Primary outcome was change in service utilisation between prepandemic and pandemic periods. Secondary outcome was the change in proportions of users of healthcare services with milder or more severe illness (eg, triage scores). Results 3097 unique references were identified, and 81 studies across 20 countries included, reporting on &gt;11 million services prepandemic and 6.9 million during pandemic. For the primary outcome, there were 143 estimates of changes, with a median 37% reduction in services overall (IQR −51% to −20%), comprising median reductions for visits of 42% (−53% to −32%), admissions 28% (−40% to −17%), diagnostics 31% (−53% to −24%) and for therapeutics 30% (−57% to −19%). Among 35 studies reporting secondary outcomes, there were 60 estimates, with 27 (45%) reporting larger reductions in utilisation among people with a milder spectrum of illness, and 33 (55%) reporting no difference. Conclusions Healthcare utilisation decreased by about a third during the pandemic, with considerable variation, and with greater reductions among people with less severe illness. While addressing unmet need remains a priority, studies of health impacts of reductions may help health systems reduce unnecessary care in the postpandemic recovery.

W3047655780,"Ultra‐processed foods and the nutrition transition: Global, regional and national trends, food systems transformations and political economy drivers","Summary Understanding the drivers and dynamics of global ultra‐processed food (UPF) consumption is essential, given the evidence linking these foods with adverse health outcomes. In this synthesis review, we take two steps. First, we quantify per capita volumes and trends in UPF sales, and ingredients (sweeteners, fats, sodium and cosmetic additives) supplied by these foods, in countries classified by income and region. Second, we review the literature on food systems and political economy factors that likely explain the observed changes. We find evidence for a substantial expansion in the types and quantities of UPFs sold worldwide, representing a transition towards a more processed global diet but with wide variations between regions and countries. As countries grow richer, higher volumes and a wider variety of UPFs are sold. Sales are highest in Australasia, North America, Europe and Latin America but growing rapidly in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. These developments are closely linked with the industrialization of food systems, technological change and globalization, including growth in the market and political activities of transnational food corporations and inadequate policies to protect nutrition in these new contexts. The scale of dietary change underway, especially in highly populated middle‐income countries, raises serious concern for global health.",2020-08-06,2020,Phillip Baker; Priscila Machado; Thiago M.

W4226461837,Federated Learning for Smart Healthcare: A Survey,"Recent advances in communication technologies and the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IOMT) have transformed smart healthcare enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may be infeasible in realistic healthcare scenarios due to the high scalability of modern healthcare networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL), as an emerging distributed collaborative AI paradigm, is particularly attractive for smart healthcare, by coordinating multiple clients (e.g., hospitals) to perform AI training without sharing raw data. Accordingly, we provide a comprehensive survey on the use of FL in smart healthcare. First, we present the recent advances in FL, the motivations, and the requirements of using FL in smart healthcare. The recent FL designs for smart healthcare are then discussed, ranging from resource-aware FL, secure and privacy-aware FL to incentive FL and personalized FL. Subsequently, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the emerging applications of FL in key healthcare domains, including health data management, remote health monitoring, medical imaging, and COVID-19 detection. Several recent FL-based smart healthcare projects are analyzed, and the key lessons learned from the survey are also highlighted.

W3013030269,Social media for rapid knowledge dissemination: early experience from the<scp>COVID</scp>‐19 pandemic,"The current COVID-19 pandemic is threatening global health. Rates of infection outside of China are rapidly increasing, with confirmed cases reported in over 160 countries as of 19 March 2020 1. During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, 21% of the global cumulative case total were healthcare workers 2. However, a recent study from Wuhan, China reported that 1716 healthcare workers were infected with COVID-19, representing 3.8% of confirmed cases 3. During the SARS epidemic, it is likely that a lack of awareness and preparedness put healthcare workers at risk 4. Thus, delivering rapid, reliable information that addresses critical infection control issues is of key importance, and tracheal intubation is known to be associated with a high risk of transmission of viral infections to healthcare workers 5, 6. The challenge is how to transfer knowledge of current best practices to the people who need it most, at a pace equal to or better than the spreading epidemic. The paths for, and rate of dissemination of traditional scholarly publications 7, static websites and even email are known to be slow. During the SARS epidemic, worldwide internet access was well established, yet gaining access to potential medical users was largely reliant on email contact and personal communication 8. Well-designed free open access educational material should distil key information in a clear, actionable format, while paired with social media–powered dissemination using social networks, in addition to traditional communication methods. Utilising social media in this way has shown promise as a speedier alternative 9. The use of the principles of the Free Open Access Medical education (FOAM) networks further provide good examples of the effectiveness of making information freely available. We describe an example of an efficient and rapidly disseminated infographic describing a practical intubation guideline for use in operating theatres and other critical care areas during a pandemic. Preventing infection and promoting psychological well-being to front-line healthcare workers during an epidemic is essential and the negative psychological impact of SARS on healthcare workers was exacerbated by uncertainty and unfamiliarity with infection control measures 4. Infection of healthcare workers disproportionately increases work-load and reduces the capacity of staff and hospitals to continue to provide patient care 10. Well-designed infographics have the potential to provide concise and practical information to institutions and healthcare workers and are associated with higher reader preference and lower cognitive load 11, 12. They aid knowledge translation by increasing information retention according to the cognitive load theory and dual coding theory 11. Moreover, making infographics easily accessible, engaging, reusable and modifiable to fit local needs and user requirements is more likely to meet the imperatives of diffusion of innovation to combat the current pandemic 13. Prince of Wales Hospital is a tertiary, academic hospital in Hong Kong affiliated with The Chinese University of Hong Kong. The clinical staff had substantial outbreak experience during the SARS pandemic. Utilising this experience, and through iterative systems testing and improvement using in-situ simulation, the unit developed an infographic on the principles of airway management focusing on infection control for staff and patient safety in the context of COVID-19. We disseminated the infographic via social media including Twitter™ and WeChat™ (Fig. 1) and via the departmental website (http://www.aic.cuhk.edu.hk/covid19). The method of dissemination was rapidly and well received by the international community, resulting in locally facilitated translations into Italian, Portuguese, French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Polish, Serbian, Farsi, Turkish, traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese and Japanese. All translations were completed and made available for users within a 10-day period. Collaborations also enabled context-specific modifications of the infographic to merge with local practices. For example, double gloving was a technique that the Italian community requested, and the infographic was modified to accommodate this for the Italian translation. As of 19 March 2020, there have been 63,440 impressions on Twitter since publication on 19 February 2020, with many retweets and requests for sharing of the infographic at their respective institutions around the world. There have been 8614 page views on the departmental website since publication on 7 March 2020. More importantly, through social media platforms and personal communication, numerous reputable organisations, including the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists, Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists, Australian Society of Anaesthetists, UK ICM Anaesthesia Covid-19 Collaboration, Brazilian Anaesthesiology Society, French Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, and others, have utilised the infographic as a resource for their respective healthcare communities. This redistribution of the material through additional, highly accessed and trusted dissemination platforms markedly increases the value of the infographic, and reduces the need for other individuals and units to waste needed resources reproducing similar material. The rapid uptake and sharing across networks, driven by healthcare workers' needs, demonstrates 'just-in-time' health professional information sharing. There are limitations to dissemination of online resources, and before considering implementation, healthcare workers must critically appraise the information provided 14. Known risks of non-peer–reviewed materials disseminated via social medial include the application of context-specific resources to unsuitable situations; engagement with biased knowledge within echo chambers' (groups consisting of only like-minded individuals) and algorithm-driven filter bubbles that selectively display information based on user preferences 15; and insufficient source information available to distinguish between valid and invalid information 16. In medicine, there is the additional risk of early adoption of unvalidated research or practice, and the risk of future medical reversal 17. Some of these issues are not unique to non-peer–reviewed resources, and peer-reviewed materials face similar challenges 18. To address these limitations, we propose criteria to be implemented by users of professional social medial platforms to promote the responsible use of social media–disseminated information (Box 1). In the current COVID-19 pandemic, social media has the potential, if responsibly and appropriately used, to provide rapid and effective dissemination routes for key information. The example provided validates this possibility. In summary, the infographic presented met the majority of above proposed criteria. The success of the dissemination was, we believe, promoted by the existing reputation of the institution, quality of the infographic imagery and content and the rapid dissemination by social media platforms with professional participants. This allowed several institutions to utilise the time-consuming work already done in the original institution, and not have to repeat the investment of time and energy to reproduce similar material. Free and rapid access to high-quality information from verifiable sources is valuable to optimise the global medical response to crises such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.

W4226048997,UK clinical guideline for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis,"Abstract Summary The National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG) has revised the UK guideline for the assessment and management of osteoporosis and the prevention of fragility fractures in postmenopausal women, and men age 50 years and older. Accredited by NICE, this guideline is relevant for all healthcare professionals involved in osteoporosis management. Introduction The UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG) first produced a guideline on the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in 2008, with updates in 2013 and 2017. This paper presents a major update of the guideline, the scope of which is to review the assessment and management of osteoporosis and the prevention of fragility fractures in postmenopausal women, and men age 50 years and older. Methods Where available, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials were used to provide the evidence base. Conclusions and recommendations were systematically graded according to the strength of the available evidence. Results Review of the evidence and recommendations are provided for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, fracture-risk assessment and intervention thresholds, management of vertebral fractures, non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, including duration and monitoring of anti-resorptive therapy, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, and models of care for fracture prevention. Recommendations are made for training; service leads and commissioners of healthcare; and for review criteria for audit and quality improvement. Conclusion The guideline, which has received accreditation from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), provides a comprehensive overview of the assessment and management of osteoporosis for all healthcare professionals involved in its management.

W3047558611,The “war over tourism”: challenges to sustainable tourism in the tourism academy after COVID-19,"COVID-19 is widely recognised as a challenge or even a game-changer for travel and tourism. It has also been a catalyst to serious debate in the ""tourism academy,"" as revealed by a discussion on TRINET Tourism Information Network via email in May 2020. The catalyst to this debate was an email by academic Jim Butcher announcing his work entitled ""the war on tourism,"" published in an online magazine. Presenting a binary between industry recovery and reform, Butcher's article denounced a body of tourism work he portrayed as hostile to the industry and as using COVID-19 as an opportunity to attack it. He argued that this resulted in harm to tourism businesses, tourism workers and ordinary tourists. These TRINET discussions worked to present a binary in schools of thought, divided by being either for the tourism industry or against it. This analysis explains how advocates of industry rapid recovery stand opposed to wider efforts to reform tourism to be more ethical, responsible and sustainable. The struggle concerns both the proper role of tourism and tourism academics.

W3132521903,"Water Security in a Changing Environment: Concept, Challenges and Solutions","Water is of vital and critical importance to ecosystems and human societies. The effects of human activities on land and water are now large and extensive. These reflect physical changes to the environment. Global change such as urbanization, population growth, socioeconomic change, evolving energy needs, and climate change have put unprecedented pressure on water resources systems. It is argued that achieving water security throughout the world is the key to sustainable development. Studies on holistic view with persistently changing dimensions is in its infancy. This study focuses on narrative review work for giving a comprehensive insight on the concept of water security, its evolution with recent environmental changes (e.g., urbanization, socioeconomic, etc.) and various implications. Finally, it presents different sustainable solutions to achieve water security. Broadly, water security evolves from ensuring reliable access of enough safe water for every person (at an affordable price where market mechanisms are involved) to lead a healthy and productive life, including that of future generations. The constraints on water availability and water quality threaten secured access to water resources for different uses. Despite recent progress in developing new strategies, practices and technologies for water resource management, their dissemination and implementation has been limited.

W3100548141,The Internet of Things: Impact and Implications for Health Care Delivery,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of wireless, interrelated, and connected digital devices that can collect, send, and store data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. The IoT promises many benefits to streamlining and enhancing health care delivery to proactively predict health issues and diagnose, treat, and monitor patients both in and out of the hospital. Worldwide, government leaders and decision makers are implementing policies to deliver health care services using technology and more so in response to the novel COVID-19 pandemic. It is now becoming increasingly important to understand how established and emerging IoT technologies can support health systems to deliver safe and effective care. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to provide an overview of the current IoT technology in health care, outline how IoT devices are improving health service delivery, and outline how IoT technology can affect and disrupt global health care in the next decade. The potential of IoT-based health care is expanded upon to theorize how IoT can improve the accessibility of preventative public health services and transition our current secondary and tertiary health care to be a more proactive, continuous, and coordinated system. Finally, this paper will deal with the potential issues that IoT-based health care generates, barriers to market adoption from health care professionals and patients alike, confidence and acceptability, privacy and security, interoperability, standardization and remuneration, data storage, and control and ownership. Corresponding enablers of IoT in current health care will rely on policy support, cybersecurity-focused guidelines, careful strategic planning, and transparent policies within health care organizations. IoT-based health care has great potential to improve the efficiency of the health system and improve population health.",2020-09-16,2020,Jaimon T. Kelly; Katrina L.

Agriculture is the main economic structure for many developed and developing countries. The modern agricultural practices affect the environment namely nutrient cycle, soil erosion, carbon sequestration, and many other ecological patterns. Organic farming is influential practice to minimize the environmental and ecological impact of sustainable development. Usage of more organic matters in agricultural practices can reduce the adverse effects on the environment by keep saving its natural cycles on recovery process and organic farming may enhance the food quality too. The organic farming may largely exclude the usage of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, growth hormones and feed additives of livestock activities.

W4317254367,"A systematic literature review of artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector: Benefits, challenges, methodologies, and functionalities","Administrative and medical processes of the healthcare organizations are rapidly changing because of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This change demonstrates the critical impact of AI at multiple activities, particularly in medical processes related to early detection and diagnosis. Previous studies suggest that AI can raise the quality of services in the healthcare industry. AI-based technologies have reported to improve human life quality, making life easier, safer and more productive. This study presents a systematic review of academic articles on the application of AI in the healthcare sector. The review initially considered 1,988 academic articles from major scholarly databases. After a careful review, the list was filtered down to 180 articles for full analysis to present a classification framework based on four dimensions: AI-enabled healthcare benefits, challenges, methodologies, and functionalities. It was identified that AI continues to significantly outperform humans in terms of accuracy, efficiency and timely execution of medical and related administrative processes. Benefits for patients' map directly to the relevant AI functionalities in the categories of diagnosis, treatment, consultation and health monitoring for self-management of chronic conditions.

W3003778471,The Blue Economy and the United Nations’ sustainable development goals: Challenges and opportunities,"The ""Blue Economy (BE)"" is an increasingly popular concept as a strategy for safeguarding the world's oceans and water resources. It may emerge when economic activity is in balance with the long term capacity of ocean ecosystems to support the activity in a sustainable manner. Importantly, the concept of BE posits the inherent conflicts between two discourses—growth and development, and protection of ocean resources. The inherent conflicts require solutions to embrace the opportunities associated with the ocean economy while recognizing and addressing its threats. The potential solutions on a global scale are advocated by the United Nations in their Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, we notice that the identification of the scope and boundaries of the BE in line with the UN's SDGs is vague even challenging, and the key stakeholders and their interests and roles in the BE are also vague. This review examines the scientific evidence of the association between the BE and the UN's SDGs, and relevance and alignment of stakeholders on the link between the BE and SDGs. Based on a literature survey between 1998 and 2018, we find that BE is highly associated with SDGs 14–17. Notably, we find that stakeholders prefer SDG 3 Good Health & Well-Being and SDG 8 Decent Work & Economic Growth in the BE context. As stakeholder involvement shows some differences and variations in the relationship between the BE and SDGs, we consider that stakeholders can play some roles directly or indirectly in the BE-SDGs context. In order to set achievable goals and targets in BE-SDGs, we support that key stakeholders should be identified to play several important roles in prosperous economic, societal development and setting tolerable ranges for the ocean biosphere.",2020-01-31,2020,Ki‐Hoon Lee; Junsung Noh; Jong Seong Khim,Griffith University,Environment International,337,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105528,Autonomous_Systems,Sustainable development; Business; Natural resource economics; Environmental planning; Political science,0.15

Some scholars have estimated gridded GDP and electricity consumption. However, such gridded data have shortcomings, including overestimating real GDP growth, ignoring the heterogeneity of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the grid, and limited time-span. Simultaneously, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) and National Polar-orbiting Partnership's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (NPP/VIIRS) nighttime light data, adopted in these studies as a proxy tool, still facing shortcomings, such as imperfect matching results, discontinuity in temporal and spatial changes. In this study, we employed a series of methods, such as a particle swarm optimization-back propagation (PSO-BP) algorithm, to unify the scales of DMSP/OLS and NPP/VIIRS images and obtain continuous 1 km × 1 km gridded nighttime light data during 1992-2019.

W3082630059,Effects of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Routine Care for Adults in Treatment for Depression and Anxiety: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background Although there is evidence for the efficacy of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT), the generalizability of results to routine care is limited. Objective This study systematically reviews effectiveness studies of guided iCBT interventions for the treatment of depression or anxiety. Methods The acceptability (uptake, participants’ characteristics, adherence, and satisfaction), effectiveness, and negative effects (deterioration) of nonrandomized pre-post designs conducted under routine care conditions were synthesized using systematic review and meta-analytic approaches. Results A total of 19 studies including 30 groups were included in the analysis. Despite high heterogeneity, individual effect sizes of investigated studies indicate clinically relevant changes, with effect sizes ranging from Hedges’ g=0.42-1.88, with a pooled effect of 1.78 for depression and 0.94 for anxiety studies. Uptake, participants’ characteristics, adherence, and satisfaction indicate a moderate to high acceptability of the interventions. The average deterioration across studies was 2.9%. Conclusions This study provides evidence supporting the acceptability and effectiveness of guided iCBT for the treatment of depression and anxiety in routine care. Given the high heterogeneity between interventions and contexts, health care providers should select interventions that have been proven in randomized controlled clinical trials. The successful application of iCBT may be an effective way of increasing health care in multiple contexts.",2020-08-31,2020,Anne Etzelmueller; Christiaan Vis; Eirini Karyotaki; Harald Baumeister; Nickolai Titov,Macquarie University,Journal of Medical Internet Research,311,https://doi.org/10.2196/18100,Autonomous_Systems,Generalizability theory; Psychological intervention; Anxiety; Meta-analysis; Randomized controlled trial,0.3
W4205687123,The worldwide impact of telemedicine during COVID-19: current evidence and recommendations for the future,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has emerged worldwide as an indispensable resource to improve the surveillance of patients, curb the spread of disease, facilitate timely identification and management of ill people, but, most importantly, guarantee the continuity of care of frail patients with multiple chronic diseases. Although during COVID-19 telemedicine has thrived, and its adoption has moved forward in many countries, important gaps still remain. Major issues to be addressed to enable large scale implementation of telemedicine include: (1) establishing adequate policies to legislate telemedicine, license healthcare operators, protect patients’ privacy, and implement reimbursement plans; (2) creating and disseminating practical guidelines for the routine clinical use of telemedicine in different contexts; (3) increasing in the level of integration of telemedicine with traditional healthcare services; (4) improving healthcare professionals’ and patients’ awareness of and willingness to use telemedicine; and (5) overcoming inequalities among countries and population subgroups due to technological, infrastructural, and economic barriers. If all these requirements are met in the near future, remote management of patients will become an indispensable resource for the healthcare systems worldwide and will ultimately improve the management of patients and the quality of care.",2022-01-01,2022,Stefano Omboni; Raj Padwal; Tourkiah Alessa; Béla Benczúr; Beverly B.

W3027290028,"Covid-19 and Women’s Triple Burden: Vignettes from Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Vietnam and Australia","During disease outbreaks, women endure additional burdens associated with paid and unpaid work, often without consideration or the alleviation of other life responsibilities. This paper draws on the concept of the triple burden in theorizing the gender divisions in productive and reproductive work and community activities in the context of disaster. Events that include famine, war, natural disaster or disease outbreak are all well documented as increasing women’s vulnerability to a worsening of gendered burdens. In the case of the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, this is no different. Focussing on Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Vietnam and Australia, the four vignettes in this paper serve to highlight the intersections between Covid-19 and gendered burdens, particularly in frontline work, unpaid care work and community activities. While pre-disaster gender burdens are well established as strong, our analysis during the early months of the pandemic indicates that women’s burdens are escalating. We estimate that women will endure a worsening of their burdens until the pandemic is well under control, and for a long time after.

W3027044802,Engage for Equity: A Long-Term Study of Community-Based Participatory Research and Community-Engaged Research Practices and Outcomes,"Community-based participatory research (CBPR) and community-engaged research have been established in the past 25 years as valued research approaches within health education, public health, and other health and social sciences for their effectiveness in reducing inequities. While early literature focused on partnering principles and processes, within the past decade, individual studies, as well as systematic reviews, have increasingly documented outcomes in community support and empowerment, sustained partnerships, healthier behaviors, policy changes, and health improvements. Despite enhanced focus on research and health outcomes, the science lags behind the practice. CBPR partnering pathways that result in outcomes remain little understood, with few studies documenting best practices. Since 2006, the University of New Mexico Center for Participatory Research with the University of Washington's Indigenous Wellness Research Institute and partners across the country has engaged in targeted investigations to fill this gap in the science. Our inquiry, spanning three stages of National Institutes of Health funding, has sought to identify which partnering practices, under which contexts and conditions, have capacity to contribute to health, research, and community outcomes. This article presents the research design of our current grant, Engage for Equity, including its history, social justice principles, theoretical bases, measures, intervention tools and resources, and preliminary findings about collective empowerment as our middle range theory of change.

W3020208733,The potential for COVID‐19 to contribute to compassion fatigue in critical care nurses,"As of April 2020, more than 2 million people worldwide had tested positive for COVID-19, and more than 200,000 deaths are attributed to this virus. It is estimated that around 15% of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will develop severe health complications, and around 5%–10% will require intensive level care due to the seriousness of the symptoms and the high mortality risk (3%–5%) (Baud et al., 2020; Murthy, Gomersall, & Fowler, 2020). At the time of writing, COVID-19 has caused the need for hospitalisation of thousands of people due to the serious pneumonia type symptoms that result in extreme breathing difficulty. Critical care units in hospitals around the world are treating people experiencing potentially life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms. In some of these settings, the pressure on staff is compounded by a lack of adequate personal protection equipment (PPE) and staff shortages, as well as shortages of beds and mechanical ventilators. Despite the challenges, nurses who work in critical and intensive care units deliver the care required and we have witnessed their courage in recent media reports, with nursing and medical personnel describing the difficulties they face on a daily basis in providing care to these very ill and infectious patients. The current situation has generated a range of stressors that could negatively impact nurses and other health workers (Jackson et al., 2020; Usher, Durkin, & Bhullar, 2020). Critical care nurses may be particularly affected by severe emotional distress which has been associated with the development of compassion fatigue (CF) and/or burnout (Alharbi, Jackson, & Usher, 2020). Indeed, Li et al. (2020), caution against ignoring vicarious traumatisation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a known emotional impact for nurses' witnessing prolonged suffering of patients in environments such as intensive and emergency care units (Alharbi, Jackson, & Usher, 2019). This impact is particularly related to their perceived inability to alleviate the suffering of those in their care. Research evidence shows that health professionals can experience various psychological problems when working in high-pressure and high-risk scenarios, such as in times of disaster and pandemic. Kang et al. (2015) found an increased risk for the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms among rescuers following the 2010 Yushu earthquake in China. The contextual factors surrounding COVID-19; such as the ease of transmission, lack of immunity among global populations, delayed testing, limited medical equipment, uncertainty of the pandemic trajectory and the general level of anxiety within the community all combine to place increasing pressure on health and welfare systems (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2020). CF and its related symptoms are a particular issue for critical care nurses in disaster contexts because the expectation to confront and cope with the need for care can exceed the ability to provide it, potentially (indirectly) leading to emotional distress in staff (Mathieu, 2014). In addition to witnessing/experiencing patient suffering and death more frequently; having the responsibility for decisions related to resource rationing and utilisation means critical care nurses are at heightened risk of developing CF and moral injury during pandemics (Doherty & Hauser, 2019). Moreover, nurses working under COVID-19 conditions (like so many other healthcare workers) are vulnerable to exposure to risk of infection, and have the added concern of potentially contracting the virus themselves or unknowingly exposing family members and friends to heightened risk. The concern about being infectious can lead to a reluctance to seek out assistance from family or friends and may reduce the capacity to be compassionate in the workplace (Wallace, Wladkowski, Gibson, & White, 2020). Craigie et al. (2016) refer to the ""cost of caring"" or the occupational hazard of working in critical care settings. The literature has clearly established that burnout and CF are high among all health professionals but especially so for those who work in environments where they are confronted daily with large numbers of people for whom the outcome is dire; such as the case for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and requiring admission to emergency or intensive care units (Wallace et al., 2020). Burnout is not just a term for being overworked; rather, it is a measurable condition that takes a heavy personal toll on health care providers, leads to lower quality care and increased errors (Alharbi et al., 2020). Similar to burnout, CF carries a heavy personal toll, including isolation from others, excessive drinking and over-eating, drug use and other detrimental coping measures. CF also increases absenteeism and turnover, and lowers morale (Alharbi et al., 2020). Importantly, it is known to be linked to situations where nurses believe their actions will not make a difference (Portnoy, 2011). This is unfortunately potentially the case for many patients with COVID-19 as once they are admitted to critical care units, events have shown us that many will not survive. Evidence to gain empirical insights into the impact of COVID-19 on nurses is only just beginning to emerge, with some unexpected findings. Wu et al. (2020) recently conducted a study of 220 health professionals (physicians and nurses) to compare the frequency of burnout between those professionals working on the COVID-19 front line in Wuhan province (n = 110) and those working in their usual hospital wards in hospitals (n = 110). Notably, the authors reported that burnout frequency was in fact lower among health professionals working on the COVID-19 front line compared to those working their usual wards (13% versus 39%, respectively (Wu et al., 2020). Although these results were somewhat unexpected, the conclusion drawn by the researchers provides an interesting insight into the nature of burnout and CF. They theorise the lower-level of burnout among the front-line workers may be the result of these health professionals having to place all of their focus on achieving positive outcomes for patients (Wu et al., 2020). This explanation, however, arguably implies that the nurses' focus is not on their own emotional well-being. Moreover, as discussed previously a leading risk factor for the development of CF among intensive care nurses is their tendency to put the care needs of the patient above their own needs. According to Wu et al. (2020), the focus of front-line carers on what they are trying to achieve rather than the personal impact of what they are trying to achieve may explain the more favourable outcomes for this group. For the nurses working in critical care environments, such as intensive care units, there is no escaping the daily parade of seriously ill patients with predicted poor outcomes in times such as those we are currently witnessing. We have seen and read of nurses describing situations where all patients have died on a unit during the course of an evening. It is hard to imagine the effect this has on the nurses working that shift. For many of the nurses in this situation, there may be little support. Hendin et al. (2020) have developed a framework for the provision of end of life care by nurses to patients faced with immediate death from COVID-19 or similarly highly transmissible acute respiratory infections. At the centre of the framework is naturally a focus on minimising risks of transmission to nurse professionals. However, the authors also recommend the framework be underpinned by the ""imperative for workplace colleagues to support each other and to perform frequent debriefs"" (p. 3). This, they conclude, is vital to reduce the risk of front-line nurses developing psychological problems including CF, burnout and vicarious trauma (Hendin et al., 2020). Furthermore, as Horesh and Brown (2020) argue, the most concerning aspect of the health care sector (as opposed to healthcare worker) response to COVID-19 for critical care nurses is the lack of a clear set of guidelines on how best to manage self-care and well-being. Current recommendations to front-line healthcare workers are to ensure work-life balance, practice deep breathing, facilitate mindfulness and support other when possible are modes of therapy or coping that independently or in combination can provide a positive effect (Van Zyl & Noonan, 2018). However, these fall short of a formal and set of guidelines (supported with resources) that critical care nurses can refer to specifically to direct their self-care efforts to manage their well-being (Horesh & Brown, 2020). At the very least, improved self-care, both in and out of the hospital environment, is necessary to help critical care nurses to reduce the risk of developing CF. In conclusion, large-scale public health events such as the COVID-19 pandemic require a dedicated and highly demanding response from critical care nurses. To support these nurses, the broader response to COVID-19 must include multiple stakeholders including, but not limited to, senior nursing staff, government policymakers, technology designers, hospital administrations, as well as members of the broader community. The decision and actions of stakeholders can play a central role in assisting nurses to manage the competing care demands caused by increased acuity, increased patient numbers, clinical uncertainty and limited access to necessary equipment. Hence, in addition to critical care nurses doing all they can to protect their own and their colleagues' well-being, they need to work with other stakeholders to mobilise beneficial partnership and collaborate on developing creative solutions. Only through a collaborative effort can any risks associated with CF and burnout in the critical care nurse workforce be identified and mitigated.",2020-04-28,2020,Jalal Alharbi; Debra Jackson; Kim Usher,University of New England,Journal of Clinical Nursing,290,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15314,Autonomous_Systems,Medicine; Burnout; Intensive care; Health care; Seriousness,0.3

Financial organizations are integrating AI in their operations: in‐house, outsourced, or ecosystem‐based. The growth of AI‐based fintech firms has encouraged several mergers and acquisitions among financial service providers and wealth managers as they grapple with volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. AI's unique promise of combined cost reduction and increased differentiation makes it generally attractive across the board. However, perhaps other than fraud detection, these benefits depend on the scale of an organization.

W3129131719,Wearable Biosensors: An Alternative and Practical Approach in Healthcare and Disease Monitoring,"With the increasing prevalence of growing population, aging and chronic diseases continuously rising healthcare costs, the healthcare system is undergoing a vital transformation from the traditional hospital-centered system to an individual-centered system. Since the 20th century, wearable sensors are becoming widespread in healthcare and biomedical monitoring systems, empowering continuous measurement of critical biomarkers for monitoring of the diseased condition and health, medical diagnostics and evaluation in biological fluids like saliva, blood, and sweat. Over the past few decades, the developments have been focused on electrochemical and optical biosensors, along with advances with the non-invasive monitoring of biomarkers, bacteria and hormones, etc. Wearable devices have evolved gradually with a mix of multiplexed biosensing, microfluidic sampling and transport systems integrated with flexible materials and body attachments for improved wearability and simplicity. These wearables hold promise and are capable of a higher understanding of the correlations between analyte concentrations within the blood or non-invasive biofluids and feedback to the patient, which is significantly important in timely diagnosis, treatment, and control of medical conditions. However, cohort validation studies and performance evaluation of wearable biosensors are needed to underpin their clinical acceptance. In the present review, we discuss the importance, features, types of wearables, challenges and applications of wearable devices for biological fluids for the prevention of diseased conditions and real-time monitoring of human health. Herein, we summarize the various wearable devices that are developed for healthcare monitoring and their future potential has been discussed in detail.",2021-02-01,2021,Atul Sharma; Mihaela Badea; Swapnil Tiwari; Jean‐Louis Marty,Monash University,Molecules,278,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26030748,Autonomous_Systems,Wearable computer; Health care; Computer science; Healthcare system; Wearable technology,0.3

Taiwan reported a lower COVID-19 incidence rate (20.7 cases per million) compared with NZ (278.0 per million). Extensive public health infrastructure established in Taiwan pre-COVID-19 enabled a fast coordinated response, particularly in the domains of early screening, effective methods for isolation/quarantine, digital technologies for identifying potential cases and mass mask use.

W3181566864,Augmented reality in medical education: students’ experiences and learning outcomes,"Augmented reality (AR) is a relatively new technology that allows for digitally generated three-dimensional representations to be integrated with real environmental stimuli. AR can make use of smart phones, tablets, or other devices to achieve a highly stimulating learning environment and hands-on immersive experience. The use of AR in industry is becoming widespread with applications being developed for use not just for entertainment and gaming but also healthcare, retail and marketing, education, military, travel and tourism, automotive industry, manufacturing, architecture, and engineering. Due to the distinct learning advantages that AR offers, such as remote learning and interactive simulations, AR-based teaching programs are also increasingly being adopted within medical schools across the world. These advantages are further highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused an even greater shift towards online learning. In this review, we investigate the use of AR in medical training/education and its effect on students' experiences and learning outcomes. This includes the main goals of AR-based learning, such as to simplify the delivery and enhance the comprehension of complex information. We also describe how AR can enhance the experiences of medical students, by improving knowledge and understanding, practical skills and social skills. These concepts are discussed within the context of specific AR medical training programs, such as HoloHuman, OculAR SIM, and HoloPatient.

W3108106255,World Health Organization 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour,"Objectives To describe new WHO 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Methods The guidelines were developed in accordance with WHO protocols. An expert Guideline Development Group reviewed evidence to assess associations between physical activity and sedentary behaviour for an agreed set of health outcomes and population groups. The assessment used and systematically updated recent relevant systematic reviews; new primary reviews addressed additional health outcomes or subpopulations. Results The new guidelines address children, adolescents, adults, older adults and include new specific recommendations for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. All adults should undertake 150–300 min of moderate-intensity, or 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or some equivalent combination of moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, per week. Among children and adolescents, an average of 60 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity across the week provides health benefits. The guidelines recommend regular muscle-strengthening activity for all age groups. Additionally, reducing sedentary behaviours is recommended across all age groups and abilities, although evidence was insufficient to quantify a sedentary behaviour threshold. Conclusion These 2020 WHO guidelines update previous WHO recommendations released in 2010. They reaffirm messages that some physical activity is better than none, that more physical activity is better for optimal health outcomes and provide a new recommendation on reducing sedentary behaviours. These guidelines highlight the importance of regularly undertaking both aerobic and muscle strengthening activities and for the first time, there are specific recommendations for specific populations including for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. These guidelines should be used to inform national health policies aligned with the WHO Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018–2030 and to strengthen surveillance systems that track progress towards national and global targets.",2020-11-25,2020,Fiona Bull; Salih S Al-Ansari; Stuart Biddle; Katja Borodulin; Matthew P.

W4236476849,The PRISMA 2020 statement: an updated guideline for reporting systematic reviews,"Background: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement, published in 2009, was designed to help systematic reviewers transparently report why the review was done, what the authors did and what they found. Over the last decade, there have been many advances in systematic review methodology and terminology, which have necessitated an update to the guideline.Objectives: To develop the PRISMA 2020 statement for reporting systematic reviews.Methods: We reviewed 60 documents with reporting guidance for systematic reviews to generate suggested modifications to the PRISMA 2009 statement. We sought feedback on the suggested modifications through an online survey of 110 systematic review methodologists and journal editors. The results of the review and survey were discussed at a 21-member in-person meeting. Following the meeting, drafts of the PRISMA 2020 checklist, abstract checklist, explanation and elaboration and flow diagram were generated and refined iteratively based on feedback from co-authors and a convenience sample of 15 systematic reviewers.Results: In this statement paper, we present the PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagrams for original and updated reviews. The checklist includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise and synthesise studies. The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation. The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement.Conclusions: The PRISMA 2020 statement is intended to facilitate transparent, complete and accurate reporting of systematic reviews.

W3092419658,Updated methodological guidance for the conduct of scoping reviews,"The objective of this paper is to describe the updated methodological guidance for conducting a JBI scoping review, with a focus on new updates to the approach and development of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (the PRISMA-ScR).Scoping reviews are an increasingly common approach to informing decision-making and research based on the identification and examination of the literature on a given topic or issue. Scoping reviews draw on evidence from any research methodology and may also include evidence from non-research sources, such as policy. In this manner, scoping reviews provide a comprehensive overview to address broader review questions than traditionally more specific systematic reviews of effectiveness or qualitative evidence. The increasing popularity of scoping reviews has been accompanied by the development of a reporting guideline: the PRISMA-ScR. In 2014, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group developed guidance for scoping reviews that received minor updates in 2017 and was most recently updated in 2020. The updates reflect ongoing and substantial developments in approaches to scoping review conduct and reporting. As such, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group recognized the need to revise the guidance to align with the current state of knowledge and reporting standards in evidence synthesis.Between 2015 and 2020, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group expanded its membership; extensively reviewed the literature; engaged via annual face-to-face meetings, regular teleconferences, and email correspondence; sought advice from methodological experts; facilitated workshops; and presented at scientific conferences. This process led to updated guidance for scoping reviews published in the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis. The updated chapter was endorsed by JBI's International Scientific Committee in 2020.The updated JBI guidance for scoping reviews includes additional guidance on several methodological issues, such as when a scoping review is (or is not) appropriate, and how to extract, analyze, and present results, and provides clarification for implications for practice and research. Furthermore, it is aligned with the PRISMA-ScR to ensure consistent reporting.The latest JBI guidance for scoping reviews provides up-to-date guidance that can be used by authors when conducting a scoping review. Furthermore, it aligns with the PRISMA-ScR, which can be used to report the conduct of a scoping review. A series of ongoing and future methodological projects identified by the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group to further refine the methodology are planned.",2020-09-22,2020,Micah D.J.

W4206927092,Defining Training and Performance Caliber: A Participant Classification Framework,"Throughout the sport-science and sports-medicine literature, the term ""elite"" subjects might be one of the most overused and ill-defined terms. Currently, there is no common perspective or terminology to characterize the caliber and training status of an individual or cohort. This paper presents a 6-tiered Participant Classification Framework whereby all individuals across a spectrum of exercise backgrounds and athletic abilities can be classified. The Participant Classification Framework uses training volume and performance metrics to classify a participant to one of the following: Tier 0: Sedentary; Tier 1: Recreationally Active; Tier 2: Trained/Developmental; Tier 3: Highly Trained/National Level; Tier 4: Elite/International Level; or Tier 5: World Class. We suggest the Participant Classification Framework can be used to classify participants both prospectively (as part of study participant recruitment) and retrospectively (during systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses). Discussion around how the Participant Classification Framework can be tailored toward different sports, athletes, and/or events has occurred, and sport-specific examples provided. Additional nuances such as depth of sport participation, nationality differences, and gender parity within a sport are all discussed. Finally, chronological age with reference to the junior and masters athlete, as well as the Paralympic athlete, and their inclusion within the Participant Classification Framework has also been considered. It is our intention that this framework be widely implemented to systematically classify participants in research featuring exercise, sport, performance, health, and/or fitness outcomes going forward, providing the much-needed uniformity to classification practices.",2021-12-29,2021,Alannah K.

W3009625718,The Global Macroeconomic Impacts of COVID-19: Seven Scenarios,"The outbreak of coronavirus named COVID-19 has disrupted the Chinese economy and is spreading globally. The evolution of the disease and its economic impact is highly uncertain which makes it difficult for policymakers to formulate an appropriate macroeconomic policy response. In order to better understand possible economic outcomes, this paper explores seven different scenarios of how COVID-19 might evolve in the coming year using a modelling technique developed by Lee and McKibbin (2003) and extended by McKibbin and Sidorenko (2006). It examines the impacts of different scenarios on macroeconomic outcomes and financial markets in a global hybrid DSGE/CGE general equilibrium model. The scenarios in this paper demonstrate that even a contained outbreak could significantly impact the global economy in the short run. These scenarios demonstrate the scale of costs that might be avoided by greater investment in public health systems in all economies but particularly in less developed economies where health care systems are less developed and popultion density is high.",2020-01-01,2020,Warwick J.

W3130938027,The Lancet Global Health Commission on Global Eye Health: vision beyond 2020,"Eye health and vision have widespread and profound implications for many aspects of life, health, sustainable development, and the economy. Yet nowadays, many people, families, and populations continue to suffer the consequences of poor access to high-quality, affordable eye care, leading to vision impairment and blindness. In 2020, an estimated 596 million people had distance vision impairment worldwide, of whom 43 million were blind. Another 510 million people had uncorrected near vision impairment, simply because of not having reading spectacles. A large proportion of those affected (90%), live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, encouragingly, more than 90% of people with vision impairment have a preventable or treatable cause with existing highly cost-effective interventions. Eye conditions affect all stages of life, with young children and older people being particularly affected. Crucially, women, rural populations, and ethnic minority groups are more likely to have vision impairment, and this pervasive inequality needs to be addressed. By 2050, population ageing, growth, and urbanisation might lead to an estimated 895 million people with distance vision impairment, of whom 61 million will be blind. Action to prioritise eye health is needed now. This Commission defines eye health as maximised vision, ocular health, and functional ability, thereby contributing to overall health and wellbeing, social inclusion, and quality of life. Eye health is essential to achieve many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Poor eye health and impaired vision have a negative effect on quality of life and restrict equitable access to and achievement in education and the workplace. Vision loss has substantial financial implications for affected individuals, families, and communities. Although high-quality data for global economic estimates are scarce, particularly for LMICs, conservative assessments based on the latest prevalence figures for 2020 suggest that annual global productivity loss from vision impairment is approximately US$410·7 billion purchasing power parity. Vision impairment reduces mobility, affects mental wellbeing, exacerbates risk of dementia, increases likelihood of falls and road traffic crashes, increases the need for social care, and ultimately leads to higher mortality rates. By contrast, vision facilitates many daily life activities, enables better educational outcomes, and increases work productivity, reducing inequality. An increasing amount of evidence shows the potential for vision to advance the SDGs, by contributing towards poverty reduction, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, quality education, gender equality, and decent work. Eye health is a global public priority, transforming lives in both poor and wealthy communities. Therefore, eye health needs to be reframed as a development as well as a health issue and given greater prominence within the global development and health agendas. Vision loss has many causes that require promotional, preventive, treatment, and rehabilitative interventions. Cataract, uncorrected refractive error, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy are responsible for most global vision impairment. Research has identified treatments to reduce or eliminate blindness from all these conditions; the priority is to deliver treatments where they are most needed. Proven eye care interventions, such as cataract surgery and spectacle provision, are among the most cost-effective in all of health care. Greater financial investment is needed so that millions of people living with unnecessary vision impairment and blindness can benefit from these interventions. Lessons from the past three decades give hope that this challenge can be met. Between 1990 and 2020, the age-standardised global prevalence of blindness fell by 28·5%. Since the 1990s, prevalence of major infectious causes of blindness—onchocerciasis and trachoma—have declined substantially. Hope remains that by 2030, the transmission of onchocerciasis will be interrupted, and trachoma will be eliminated as a public health problem in every country worldwide. However, the ageing population has led to a higher crude prevalence of age-related causes of blindness, and thus an increased total number of people with blindness in some regions. Key messagesEye health is essential to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; vision needs to be reframed as a development issueThere is extensive evidence showing that improving eye health contributes directly and indirectly to achieving many Sustainable Development Goals, including reducing poverty and improving work productivity, general and mental health, and education and equity. Improving eye health is a practical and cost-effective way of unlocking human potential. Eye health needs to be reframed as an enabling, cross-cutting issue within the sustainable development framework.Almost everyone will experience impaired vision or an eye condition during their lifetime and require eye care services; urgent action is necessary to meet the rapidly growing eye health needIn 2020, 1·1 billion people had distance vision impairment or uncorrected presbyopia. By 2050, this figure is expected to rise to 1·8 billion. Most affected people live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) with avoidable causes of vision impairment. During the life course, most people will experience vision impairment, even if just the need for reading glasses. Because of unmet needs and an ageing global population, eye health is a major public health and sustainable development concern which warrants urgent political action.Eye health is an essential component of universal health coverage; it must be included in planning, resourcing, and delivery of health careUniversal health coverage is not universal without affordable, high quality, equitable eye care. In line with the WHO World report on vision, we urge countries to consider eye care as an essential service within universal health coverage. To deliver comprehensive services including promotion, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation, eye care needs to be included in national strategic health plans and development policies, health financing structures, and health workforce planning. Coordinated intersectoral action is needed to systematically improve population eye health, also within healthy ageing initiatives, schools, and the workplace. Integration of eye health services with multiple relevant components of health service delivery and at all levels of the health system is of central importance.High quality eye health services are not universally delivered; concerted action is needed to improve quality and outcomes, providing effective, efficient, safe, timely, equitable, and people-centred careUse of effective service coverage indicators for cataract and refractive error highlight the delivery gap between population eye health needs and the delivery of good outcomes. We urge eye health providers to take a holistic view to emphasise quality and design service delivery based on individual and population needs: a people-centred approach. Services need to be characterised by inclusiveness and equity in design and delivery, proactively addressing the needs of marginalised and vulnerable groups through targeted interventions. To encourage improved quality in cataract surgery, we support redefining a good vision outcome threshold as 6/12 or better.Highly cost-effective vision-restoring interventions offer enormous potential to improve the economic outlook of individuals and nations; a major scale up of financial investment in eye health is requiredFor 2020, we estimate that vision impairment resulted in $410·7 billion lost economic productivity; the full cost is most likely higher. Treatments for cataract and refractive error would meet more than 90% of unmet needs and are highly cost-effective. The case for countries to invest in improving population eye health is compelling and more financial resources are urgently required.Financial barriers to accessing eye care leave many people behind; eye health needs to be included in national health financing to pool the riskHealth-care costs prevent many people from accessing essential eye health services. Eye care needs to be integrated into general health system financing to remove cost barriers. To improve access for the whole population and mitigate eye care expenditure, mechanisms that pool risk are highly desirable.Technology and treatment developments offer new tools to improve eye health; thoughtful application is needed to maximise the potential to improve coverage, accessibility, quality, efficiency, and affordabilityTechnological developments such as telemedicine, mHealth, and artificial intelligence offer the potential to revolutionise eye health care in the next decade by delivering affordable, high-quality services to remote areas. However, caution is needed to ensure all populations benefit from these developments.The eye health workforce is unable to meet population needs in many countries; major expansion in service capacity is required through increased numbers, sharing tasks, strengthened training, enabling work environments, and effective leadershipMany areas have major shortages of personnel working in eye health. The available workforce needs to be distributed according to population need. Quality of training for the workforce needs to be updated, with renewed emphasis on competency. Enabling working environments need to be created, including appropriate support, supervision, and equipment. Long-standing issues of low productivity need to be systematically resolved. Mentoring and other programmes to cultivate an emerging generation of eye health leaders are needed.Reliable survey and service data are key to progress in eye health; robust indicator data are needed to shape change and drive actionTo monitor progress in delivering improved eye health within universal health coverage, a balanced set of robust indicators are needed, which we outlined in this Commission. Service data should be available and used by implementers and policy makers to drive change. We highlight the scarcity of epidemiological data in several regions, which should be addressed as a priority.Research has been crucial to advances in understanding and treating eye disease; solution-focused, contextually relevant research is urgently needed to deliver innovative prevention and treatment strategies and inform implementation of eye health within universal health coverageImplementation research is needed, particularly in LMICs, to guide effective delivery of services within universal health coverage. Discovery research is needed for specific areas that remain without efficacious interventions. The economic impact of vision impairment, and the costs and benefits of interventions are only partly understood; a coordinated global effort to systematically collect data is needed. A step-change in the capacity of LMICs to do contextually relevant eye health research and a greater commitment are needed to improve diversity and inclusion in the research community.

Research has been crucial to advances in understanding and treating eye disease; solution-focused, contextually relevant research is urgently needed to deliver innovative prevention and treatment strategies and inform implementation of eye health within universal health coverage Implementation research is needed, particularly in LMICs, to guide effective delivery of services within universal health coverage. Discovery research is needed for specific areas that remain without efficacious interventions. The economic impact of vision impairment, and the costs and benefits of interventions are only partly understood; a coordinated global effort to systematically collect data is needed. A step-change in the capacity of LMICs to do contextually relevant eye health research and a greater commitment are needed to improve diversity and inclusion in the research community. Despite this progress, business as usual will not keep pace with the demographic trends of an ageing global population or address the inequities that persist in each country. New threats to eye health are emerging, including the worldwide increase in diabetic retinopathy, high myopia, retinopathy of prematurity, and chronic eye diseases of ageing such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. With the projected increase in such conditions and their associated vision loss over the coming decades, urgent action is needed to develop innovative treatments and deliver services at a greater scale than previously achieved. Good eye health at the community and national level has been marginalised as a luxury available to only wealthy or urban areas. Eye health needs to be urgently brought into the mainstream of national health and development policy, planning, financing, and action. The challenge is to develop and deliver comprehensive eye health services (promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation) that address the full range of eye conditions within the context of universal health coverage. Accessing services should not bring the risk of falling into poverty and services should be of high quality, as envisaged by the WHO framework for health-care quality: effective, safe, people-centred, timely, equitable, integrated, and efficient. To this framework we add the need for services to be environmentally sustainable. Universal health coverage is not universal without eye care. Multiple obstacles need to be overcome to achieve universal coverage for eye health. Important issues include complex barriers to availability and access to quality services, cost, major shortages and maldistribution of well-trained personnel, and lack of suitable, well maintained equipment and consumables. These issues are particularly widespread in LMICs, but also occur in underserved communities in high-income countries. Strong partnerships need to be formed with natural allies working in areas affected by eye health, such as non-communicable diseases, neglected tropical diseases, healthy ageing, children's services, education, disability, and rehabilitation. The eye health sector has traditionally focused on treatment and rehabilitation, and underused health promotion and prevention strategies to lessen the impact of eye disease and reduce inequality. Solving these problems will depend on solutions established from high quality evidence that can guide more effective implementation at scale. Evidence-based approaches will need to address existing deficiencies in the supply and demand. Strategic investments in discovery research, harnessing new findings from diverse fields, and implementation research to guide effective scale up are needed globally. Encouragingly, developments in telemedicine, mobile health, artificial intelligence, and distance learning could potentially enable eye care professionals to deliver higher quality care that is more plentiful, equitable, and cost-effective. This Commission did a Grand Challenges in Global Eye Health prioritisation exercise to highlight key areas for concerted research and action. This exercise has identified a broad set of challenges spanning the fields of epidemiology, health systems, diagnostics, therapeutics, and implementation. The most compelling of these issues, picked from among 3400 suggestions proposed by 336 people from 118 countries, can help to frame the future research agenda for global eye health. In this Commission, we harness lessons learned from over two decades, present the growing evidence for the life-transforming impact of eye care, and provide a thorough understanding of rapid developments in the field. This report was created through a broad consultation involving experts within and outside the eye care sector to help inform governments and other stakeholders about the path forward for eye health beyond 2020, to further the SDGs (including universal health coverage), and work towards a world without avoidable vision loss. The next few years are a crucial time for the global eye health community and its partners in health care, government, and other sectors to consider the successes and challenges encountered in the past two decades, and at the same time to chart a way forward for the upcoming decades. Moving forward requires building on the strong foundation laid by WHO and partners in VISION 2020 with renewed impetus to ultimately deliver high quality universal eye health care for all.",2021-02-17,2021,Matthew J.

W3020179824,"Pandemics, transformations and tourism: be careful what you wish for","Disease outbreaks and pandemics have long played a role in societal and economic change. However, the nature of such change is selective, meaning that it is sometimes minimal and, at other times, and change or transformation may be unexpected, potentially even reinforcing contemporary paradigms. A comprehensive overview of pandemics and their effects is provided. This is used to help contextualise the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on tourism and government, industry and consumer response. Drawing on the available literature, factors that will affect tourism and destination recovery are then identified. Some measures will continue or even expand present growth orientations in tourism while others may contribute to sustainability. It is concluded that that the selective nature of the effects of COVID-19 and the measures to contain it may lead to reorientation of tourism in some cases, but in others will contribute to policies reflecting the selfish nationalism of some countries. However, the response to planetary limits and sustainable tourism requires a global approach. Despite clear evidence of this necessity, the possibility for a comprehensive transformation of the tourism system remains extremely limited without a fundamental transformation of the entire planet.",2020-04-28,2020,C.

W3008652539,Research co-design in health: a rapid overview of reviews,"Abstract Background Billions of dollars are lost annually in health research that fails to create meaningful benefits for patients. Engaging in research co-design – the meaningful involvement of end-users in research – may help address this research waste. This rapid overview of reviews addressed three related questions, namely (1) what approaches to research co-design exist in health settings? (2) What activities do these research co-design approaches involve? (3) What do we know about the effectiveness of existing research co-design approaches? The review focused on the study planning phase of research, defined as the point up to which the research question and study design are finalised. Methods Reviews of research co-design were systematically identified using a rapid overview of reviews approach (PROSPERO: CRD42019123034). The search strategy encompassed three academic databases, three grey literature databases, and a hand-search of the journal Research Involvement and Engagement . Two reviewers independently conducted the screening and data extraction and resolved disagreements through discussion. Disputes were resolved through discussion with a senior author (PB). One reviewer performed quality assessment. The results were narratively synthesised. Results A total of 26 records (reporting on 23 reviews) met the inclusion criteria. Reviews varied widely in their application of ‘research co-design’ and their application contexts, scope and theoretical foci. The research co-design approaches identified involved interactions with end-users outside of study planning, such as recruitment and dissemination. Activities involved in research co-design included focus groups, interviews and surveys. The effectiveness of research co-design has rarely been evaluated empirically or experimentally; however, qualitative exploration has described the positive and negative outcomes associated with co-design. The research provided many recommendations for conducting research co-design, including training participating end-users in research skills, having regular communication between researchers and end-users, setting clear end-user expectations, and assigning set roles to all parties involved in co-design. Conclusions Research co-design appears to be widely used but seldom described or evaluated in detail. Though it has rarely been tested empirically or experimentally, existing research suggests that it can benefit researchers, practitioners, research processes and research outcomes. Realising the potential of research co-design may require the development of clearer and more consistent terminology, better reporting of the activities involved and better evaluation.",2020-02-11,2020,Peter Slattery; Alexander K.

W3002054708,"A meta-analysis of self-determination theory-informed intervention studies in the health domain: effects on motivation, health behavior, physical, and psychological health","There are no literature reviews that have examined the impact of health-domain interventions, informed by self-determination theory (SDT), on SDT constructs and health indices. Our aim was to meta-analyse such interventions in the health promotion and disease management literatures. Studies were eligible if they used an experimental design, tested an intervention that was based on SDT, measured at least one SDT-based motivational construct, and at least one indicator of health behaviour, physical health, or psychological health. Seventy-three studies met these criteria and provided sufficient data for the purposes of the review. A random-effects meta-analytic model showed that SDT-based interventions produced small-to-medium changes in most SDT constructs at the end of the intervention period, and in health behaviours at the end of the intervention period and at the follow-up. Small positive changes in physical and psychological health outcomes were also observed at the end of the interventions. Increases in need support and autonomous motivation (but not controlled motivation or amotivation) were associated with positive changes in health behaviour. In conclusion, SDT-informed interventions positively affect indices of health; these effects are modest, heterogeneous, and partly due to increases in self-determined motivation and support from social agents.",2020-01-27,2020,Nikos Ntoumanis; Johan Y.

W3011997868,Practical Guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease (IWGDF 2019 update),"Abstract Diabetic foot disease results in a major global burden for patients and the health care system. The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has been producing evidence‐based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease since 1999. In 2019, all IWGDF Guidelines have been updated based on systematic reviews of the literature and formulation of recommendations by multidisciplinary experts from all over the world. In this document, the IWGDF Practical Guidelines, we describe the basic principles of prevention, classification, and treatment of diabetic foot disease, based on the six IWGDF Guideline chapters. We also describe the organizational levels to successfully prevent and treat diabetic foot disease according to these principles and provide addenda to assist with foot screening. The information in these practical guidelines is aimed at the global community of health care professionals who are involved in the care of persons with diabetes. Many studies around the world support our belief that implementing these prevention and management principles is associated with a decrease in the frequency of diabetes‐related lower extremity amputations. We hope that these updated practical guidelines continue to serve as reference document to aid health care providers in reducing the global burden of diabetic foot disease.",2020-03-01,2020,Nicolaas C.

W3048186973,The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance,"Concerns about secondary use of data and limited opportunities for benefit-sharing have focused attention on the tension that Indigenous communities feel between (1) protecting Indigenous rights and interests in Indigenous data (including traditional knowledges) and (2) supporting open data, machine learning, broad data sharing, and big data initiatives. The International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group (within the Research Data Alliance) is a network of nation-state based Indigenous data sovereignty networks and individuals that developed the 'CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance' (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, scholars, non-profit organizations, and governments. The CARE Principles are people– and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing innovation, governance, and self-determination among Indigenous Peoples. The Principles complement the existing data-centric approach represented in the 'FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship' (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). The CARE Principles build upon earlier work by the Te Mana Raraunga Maori Data Sovereignty Network, US Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network, Maiam nayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Sovereignty Collective, and numerous Indigenous Peoples, nations, and communities. The goal is that stewards and other users of Indigenous data will 'Be FAIR and CARE.'

W3020258303,Socialising tourism for social and ecological justice after COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic of 2019–2020 has the potential to transform the tourism industry as well as the context in which it operates. This global crisis in which travel, tourism, hospitality and events have been shut down in many parts of the world, provides an opportunity to uncover the possibilities in this historic transformative moment. A critical tourism analysis of these events briefly uncovers the ways in which tourism has supported neoliberal injustices and exploitation. The COVID-19 pandemic crisis may offer a rare and invaluable opportunity to rethink and reset tourism toward a better pathway for the future. 'Responsible' approaches to tourism alone, however, will not offer sufficient capacity to enable such a reset. Instead, such a vision requires a community-centred tourism framework that redefines and reorients tourism based on the rights and interests of local communities and local peoples. Theoretically, such an approach includes a way tourism could be 'socialised' by being recentred on the public good. This is essential for tourism to be made accountable to social and ecological limits of the planet.",2020-04-23,2020,Freya Higgins‐Desbiolles,University of South Australia,Tourism Geographies,804,https://doi.org/10.1080/14616688.2020.1757748,Cybersecurity,Tourism; Context (archaeology); Tourism geography; Hospitality; Environmental ethics,0.208

W3025109728,Preventing problematic internet use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Consensus guidance,"As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have introduced steps such as spatial distancing and ""staying at home"" to curb its spread and impact. The fear resulting from the disease, the 'lockdown' situation, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity raise the level of stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by people all around the world. Psychoactive substances and other reinforcing behaviors (e.g., gambling, video gaming, watching pornography) are often used to reduce stress and anxiety and/or to alleviate depressed mood. The tendency to use such substances and engage in such behaviors in an excessive manner as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable. Moreover, the importance of information and communications technology (ICT) is even higher in the present crisis than usual. ICT has been crucial in keeping parts of the economy going, allowing large groups of people to work and study from home, enhancing social connectedness, providing greatly needed entertainment, etc. Although for the vast majority ICT use is adaptive and should not be pathologized, a subgroup of vulnerable individuals are at risk of developing problematic usage patterns.

W3037665161,Effects of COVID-19 on hotel marketing and management: a perspective article,"Purpose This paper aims to discuss the effects of COVID-19 on hotel marketing and management practices and outlines a three-pronged research agenda to stimulate knowledge development in the hotel sector. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on an overview of the relevant literature on hotel marketing and management and the hotel guest behavior. The authors also investigated hospitality service trends to propose a research agenda. Findings This paper presents a research agenda from three dimensions – artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, hygiene and cleanliness and health and health care. First, different types of AI (mechanical, thinking and feeling) might open up distinct research streams at the intersection of health crises and hotel management, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this paper recommends that researchers move beyond typical perspectives on the antecedents and outcomes of hotel hygiene and cleanliness to delve into guests’ perceptions of the cleanliness of specific hotel surfaces. Furthermore, a more in-depth analysis is warranted about the evolving relationship between hotels and the health-care sector. Practical implications The recommended research areas are intended to advance the knowledge base to help hotels recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The suggested research streams are expected to provide actionable insights to promote the development and sustainability of the hotel sector.

W3016539487,Covid‐19: Supporting nurses' psychological and mental health,"""I broke down and cried today. I cried of exhaustion, of defeat. Because after 4 years of being an ER nurse, I suddenly feel like I know nothing"" (Sydni Lane, USA, Instagram and Facebook). (Fick , 2020) ""It's an experience I would compare to a world war"" Roberta Re, Italy. (Giuffrida, 2020) ""we're on our knees here, and it's really difficult and we're all trying the best we can and we don't feel… we feel like we could be doing more, and I know we can't … we're staying away from our families and we're putting ourselves in danger to try and save other people's loved ones, it feels like a losing battle but it's not, we've all got hope and we're all trying to do what we can."" (Shirley Watts, UK ICU Nurse, BBC news 04 April 2020) As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic takes hold, nurses are on the front line of health and social care in the most extreme of circumstances. We reflect during a moment in time (week three of lockdown in the UK and week 5/6 across Europe) to highlight the issues facing nurses at this unprecedented time. At the bedside 24 hr a day seven days a week, in similar outbreaks, nurses have had the highest levels of occupational stress and resulting distress compared with other groups (Cheong & Lee, 2004; Maunder et al., 2006; Nickell et al., 2004). Nurses are already a high-risk group, with the suicide rate among nurses 23% higher than the national average (ONS, 2017). Despite this, the RCN (Royal College of Nursing in the UK) has reported that nurses feel ""repeatedly"" ignored by their employers when they raise concerns about their mental health (Mitchell, 2019). A focus on personal responsibility for psychological health and well-being and an overemphasis on nurses being ""resilient"" in the face of under-staffing and often intense emotional work is consistently challenged by nurses and nurse academics (Traynor, 2018). Treating resilience as an individual trait is seen to ""let organisations off the hook"" (Traynor, 2018), yet has often been the focus of organisational strategies to date. This does not work at the best of times and certainly is not appropriate now in these most difficult of circumstances. Here, we discuss the stressors and challenges and present evidence-informed guidance to address the physical and psychological needs of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. We stress the importance of peer and team support to enable positive recovery after acutely stressful and emotionally draining experiences, and outline what managers, organisations and leaders can do to support nurses at this most critical of times. The high prevalence of COVID-19 in the general population of many countries, its novelty and highly infectious nature, and the associated morbidity and mortality rates are placing an unprecedented demand on health and social care services worldwide. In addition to the admission to hospital of high numbers of critically ill patients, care demands on nurses and care assistants have also increased in the community, in care homes and in learning disability and mental health services. These demands must be met by an already-depleted workforce (+44,000 RN vacancies in the UK pre-COVID-19) and one that is further depleted at this time due to infection, self-isolation and family responsibilities in the face of the crisis. The nature of care itself and new ways of working are potentially highly stressful for staff. Nurses are not only experiencing an increase in the volume and intensity of their work, but are having to accommodate new protocols and a very ""new normal."" For instance, many mental health services have transformed almost overnight from providing face-to-face care and treatment to a predominately virtual service of telephone or video consultations. In many other areas, nurses are adjusting to providing end-of-life care more frequently and often in the face of more rapid deterioration than they are used to. Isolation rules mean the presence of family at the bedside is rarely possible. Nurses are therefore frequently standing in for family members and facilitating remote access for loved ones. Established nurse–patient ratios are under strain. In ITU in the UK, for instance, staff-patient ratios of one-to-one are changing to ratios of one ITU nurse to six or more patients, with the shortfall being made up by staff without ITU experience. To boost the nursing workforce, many countries have also fast-tracked their final-year nursing students to join the nursing register early and have encouraged retired colleagues back to practice (Jackson et al., 2020). Many nurses have been redeployed, working in new specialities or in higher acuity areas. All of these factors are likely to be adding stress for existing staff, with additional implications for the well-being of new members of the team. Evidence from studies on COVID-19 and other infectious respiratory disease outbreaks reflects high concern among nurses for personal or family health in the face of direct contact with a potentially deadly virus and the stress of balancing this concern with the ethical obligations of continuing to provide care (Jiang, 2020; Khalid, Khalid, Qabajah, Barnard, & Qushmaq, 2016; Kim & Choi, 2016; Nickell et al., 2004). Other stressors evident from research to date include concerns about shortages of staff and of personal protective equipment (PPE), navigating an unfamiliar setting or system of care and lack of organisational support (Kim, 2018; O'Boyle, Robertson, & Secor-Turner, 2006; Shih et al., 2009). Additionally psychological conflicts between healthcare workers' responsibility to care for the ill and their right to protect themselves from a potentially lethal virus were reported (Chen, Wu, Yang, & Yen, 2005). Our own anecdotal sources in the UK and Europe endorse these findings for COVID-19 as (at time of writing) we approach the peak of the pandemic, but also raise the possibility of other stressors including moral distress resulting from treatment decisions based on finite resources, the lack of access to antigen or antibody testing for most front-line staff, and the discomfort and fatigue resulting from long shifts spent wearing full PPE. On social media, nurses speak of crippling tiredness after long shifts with sore faces after so many hours in masks, as well as communication barriers with colleagues and patients when wearing full PPE; nurses often cannot hear patients, and patients can struggle too; not being able to see nurses' faces or hear what is said. Nurses also speak of the difficult ethical and moral judgements that are being taken in hospitals; care homes and the community throughout the world. They tell of experiencing stigma in the wider community, being perceived as a threat to the safety of others and as ""disease-carriers."" As the number of COVID-19 patients grow, there will be increasingly stringent rules about who can be offered ventilation, with one doctor suggesting ""soon many of our own staff would not meet the criteria"" (Anon & The Guardian, 2020). Reflecting on the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) COVID-19 guidelines for the criteria that doctors and nurses should follow, the moral philosopher Yascha Mounk reflects: ""If you are an overworked nurse battling a novel disease under the most desperate circumstances, and you simply cannot treat everyone, however hard you try, whose life should you save?"" (Mounk, 2020). Nurses are likely to experience moral and ethical conflict with the potential for stress and moral distress or moral injury (Bridges et al., 2013; Greenberg, Docherty, Gnanapragasam, & Wessely, 2020; Morley, Ives, Bradbury-Jones, & Irvine, 2019). These stressors are present across settings in health and social care, and relevant to all members of the nursing team, including care assistants and temporary members of the team drafted in from their studies or from retirement. There is also an emerging narrative of guilt and some of potential shaming among nurses and students who are unable to contribute to direct patient care due to their own high risk and vulnerability to coronavirus. Nurses and their unions are speaking up about the lack of testing for front-line staff and the variation in access to PPE. Nationally and internationally it appears there is wide variation in access to PPE and the Royal College of Nursing in the UK and its counterparts across the world have been campaigning for adequate PPE for nurses suggesting the nursing voice has been side-lined in the relevant debates (Ford, 2020). In many countries, the focus has been on acute and intensive care; however, nurses in the community and mental health and learning disability settings may also have inadequate access to PPE. The UK priorities for PPE distribution and testing are being interpreted as further discrimination against nurses who do not work in acute physical health settings, leading to further anger that some lives appear to matter less. A failure to protect nursing staff adequately is causing anger and frustration, making nurses feel unsafe at work, while they are risking their own health and fearful of transmission to their families. Unless nurses feel well supported by their organisations and governments, that anger may linger after the crisis potentially causing some to leave the profession. It would be difficult as a nurse not to have strong emotional reactions to the COVID-19 virus and its impact on one's work (fear, anger, frustration, worries). Such fear and anxieties are normal, as are the intense feelings evoked when nurses feel unable to care for patients as they would have otherwise. Nurses and healthcare or nursing assistants, in acute, community mental health and social care settings are having to make extremely difficult decisions from one moment to the next. They are having to be very creative about new ways of working with very ill patients with mental health needs or learning disabilities or dementia. Legal frameworks to support the continuation of care at times of mental health crises such as (in the UK) potential temporary amendments to the Mental Health Act 1983 and the Coronavirus Act 2020 which enforce isolation; place further strain on therapeutic relationships and the delicate balance between nursing care and restrictive practice. In situations where compliance with social distancing and isolation with COVID-19 is low on the list of priorities for people in receipt of care, nurses are having to weigh up human rights, safeguarding and infectious disease protocols all of which may potentially conflict. There are some good signs that health systems are recognising how important it is to support healthcare staff. In the UK, NHS staff have been given free access to more than 1,500 specialists, online therapy and group counselling sessions and will receive practical and financial assistance as well as specialist bereavement and psychological support. Volunteers from charities including Hospice UK, the Samaritans and Shout are staffing phone and text helplines. The NHS is also offering free access to support from Apps such as Headspace, UnMind and Big Health for healthcare staff and their families to include guided meditation and tools to battle anxiety and help with sleep problems. This is a good start, but these services rely on the individual seeking help, and this may well not be sufficient. Investment in a range of supportive measures that do not just place the onus on the individual is almost certainly necessary. Supporting nurses practically and psychologically is essential to preserving their health in the short and long term, particularly when occupational stress levels are so high. Ensuring psychological well-being requires a layered response, with different components at different times, comprising strategies aimed at prevention through to treatment, and strategies/actions at different levels, from organisational and team/ward responses to those aimed at individual self-care and peer support. Response to the specific unprecedented challenge of COVID-19 will also need a flexible strategy as needs and requirements are likely to change over the course of the pandemic response. Furthermore, nurses working outside acute hospitals, working autonomously or in dispersed teams across large geographical areas can find accessing support challenging. Having reviewed the literature and gathered intervention resources from a variety of sources, it is evident that there is much to learn from other similar crisis situations such as SARS, MERS and Ebola. The evidence base in this area is considered weak, and most research is observational or has focussed on early interventions after major incidents and once the crisis has passed (Billings et al., 2020). From a nursing perspective, few studies consider nursing outside of hospital walls. In Figure 1, we present strategies and interventions aimed at supporting nurses' psychological well-being during the COVID-19 crisis. This guidance is led by best-available evidence, underpinned by theory (see Figure 1), expert opinion and models used in the military, as well as experiences from other countries and other infectious disease outbreaks (Watson, 2020; Watson, Brymer, & Bonanno, 2011; Watson et al., 2013). Below, we highlight physiological and safety needs; peer support; team support; and the roles and needs of managers and leaders as well as long-term recovery support needs. While at work and outside of work, nurses should prioritise their own well-being as much as possible, paying attention to meeting their essential needs for drinks, food, rest and sleep, and building in rest and comfort breaks (Cole-King & Dykes, 2020). At times of crisis, human physiological and safety needs come to the forefront—adequate food, shelter, rest, sleep and safety needs for example (Kenrick, Griskevicius, Neuberg, & Schaller, 2010). Recent interviews with medical staff (including nurses) treating COVID-19 in a hospital in Hunan Province support this (Chen et al., 2020). A detailed psychological intervention package (online course to deal with psychological problems; a psychological assistance hotline; and group interventions) encountered obstacles, as staff were reluctant to participate. Staff reported not needing a psychologist at this time, as they were concerned with more immediate worries including not wanting their families to worry; more rest without interruption; enough protective supplies; and support and training with patients' anxiety and panic. The psychological intervention measures were therefore adjusted to include a place to rest; guaranteed food and daily living supplies; videos of their work to share with families to alleviate concerns; training to manage patient's psychological problems; and access to security staff for un-cooperative patients. Finally, psychological counsellors regularly visited the rest areas to listen to staff difficulties and stories and provide support accordingly (Chen et al., 2020). In countries still grappling with the threat of the surge from the virus, there are calls from nurses for adequate PPE; hot food; and access to testing. Getting the timing right for psychological support chimes with the wider evidence base that intervening too early with more intense support, for example psychological debriefing, can be harmful (McNally, Bryant, & Ehlers, 2003; Rose, Bisson, Churchill, & Wessely, 2009). Drawing on the work of Patricia Watson (Watson, 2020; Watson et al., 2011, 2013), we know that akin to the armed forces, healthcare work is team-driven. Those injured by stress may be the last to recognise it and stigma can be an obstacle to asking for help. Thus, individuals often do not prioritise taking good care of themselves; recognising it may put pressure on colleagues; or they fear letting the team down. However, without looking after self, nurses cannot look after others. Yet health professionals are ""wired"" to look after others and not self—they are therefore likely to need others (colleagues, friends (peers) and managers) to remind them to think of themselves. For example, last week a colleague spoke of getting a glass of water for a nursing team member who had not had a drink for more than 8 hr. See Figure 1 for strategies and interventions for individual and peer support. During the pandemic, nurses may be working with people who are not their usual team colleagues. Teams therefore need to support each other and find ways to help new members feel safe, valued and welcome as quickly as possible (see Figure 1). Buddying with more experienced colleagues can help support colleagues who have returned from practice, have been redeployed or are final-year students who are counted in the numbers or in some countries have been registered early (Maunder et al., 2006). However, buddying needs to be closely monitored, so that the same people are not overburdened. Managerial support and resourcing should be provided so that buddying is not seen as an easy way out for organisations meaning they are not providing adequate psychological or other support. All members of the team—temporary and longer-standing—need access to support during and after the shift. In the Creating Learning Environments for Compassionate Care (CLECC) study (Bridges et al., 2018), registered nurses and healthcare assistants identified the benefits of nursing teams engaging in mid-shift cluster discussions to check in on each other's well-being. This echoes other findings; that the creation of unmanaged spaces for work-team members to ""take shelter"" (Bolton, 2005:134) provides valuable learning and social support for nurses undertaking difficult work with clients (Bolton, 2005; Parker, 2002). Staff in the CLECC study welcomed an opportunity to briefly meet mid-shift to check in on each other's well-being (well-being was the primary focus, unlike safety huddles) and other evidence suggests huddles at the beginning and end of shifts can also help to activate social support for each other (see Figure 1). In noncrisis times, there is evidence that group reflective spaces such as Schwartz Rounds can reduce stress, improve team connectedness and increase compassion for self, colleagues and patients (Maben et al., 2018). However, to maintain psychological safety in Rounds, our study confirmed that staff stories told by panel members should not be too ""raw""; staff should have had the opportunity to process and digest a difficult case or experience to protect staff from poor adjustment (Rose et al., 2009). Thus, Schwartz Rounds as previously run (open to all in the organisation and monthly face to face) may not be the ""right"" solution at the height of the pandemic. The Point of Care Foundation in the UK is therefore adapting their expertise in Schwartz Rounds to offer training in ""Team Time."" Team Time has the core features of Schwartz Rounds, but in a virtual format to be run in smaller existing teams (not across the whole organisations); with careful selection by experienced facilitators of ""safe"" stories and for a shorter time (30 min instead of an hour) with two facilitators present (Groves, 2020). These Team Time sessions are being implemented in clinical practice and in student and other teams in the next few weeks and we plan to use them with our 3rd-year students at the University of Surrey. Importantly, these adaptations will require timely evaluation. A consistent finding from studies of members of the armed forces is that team cohesion horizontally (between colleagues) and vertically (between leaders and their teams) is highly correlated with mental health, with a reported 10-fold difference in trauma-related mental health status between troops who perceived themselves as having a good or bad leader (Jones et al., 2012). There is therefore much managers and leaders can do to support nurses in their teams and organisations (see Figure 1 for strategies and interventions). Evidence-informed guidelines also suggest clear regular and honest communication is key as well as visibility and ensuring access to physiological and safety needs (Billings et al., 2020; Cole-King & Dykes, 2020). It is also important that senior nurses seek support for themselves, so that they have the capacity to support others and are able to role model good self-care. Opportunities to process decisions and access to a reflective space are particularly important for senior nurses, where they can think through the difficult decisions they are having to make in response to COVID-19 challenges. They will need their nursing/ healthcare friends and peers to lean on during the pandemic. Buddying or seeking a respected mentor for confidential peer support is therefore important. Evidence tells us it is important not to pathologise what are normal fears and anxieties in such extraordinary and frightening situations and stress zones, and that needs change over time (Billings et al., 2020). Most individuals exposed to highly challenging or traumatic events exhibit resilience and do not suffer any long-term negative psychological effects (Rubin, Brewin, Greenberg, Simpson, & Wessely, 2005). However, inevitably some will suffer distress; in most cases, these symptoms resolve without the need for any formal interventions (Greenberg, Wessely, & Wykes, 2015).There is evidence of staff experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after previous infectious disease outbreaks for example Ebola (Greenberg et al., 2015)—but that does not mean all staff will experience poor mental health outcomes. However, it will be important to understand the psychological needs of the nursing workforce following the height of the pandemic, so that individually, in teams and across organisations as well as across nations, we can learn together and make sure nurses have access to adequate support in the subsequent recovery phase to avoid a generation of nurses with poor psychological health. Post-pandemic or in the tail of the acute phase staff may be ""running on empty"" some may have unresolved grief, if staff colleagues have died or family members (and there has been no time to grieve), and some may have burnout or possibly retrospective guilt (Cole-King & Dykes, 2020; Greenberg et al., 2015). It is important that interventions do no harm and are tailored to individual need. Attendance at talking therapies and reflective groups should be optional. If conducted too early or inappropriately, detailed processing could disrupt an individual's normal coping mechanism and psychological debriefing is now undertaken with great care. A body of controlled research has raised serious questions regarding the timing of the beneficial effects of debriefing, especially as a one-off event, in terms of long-term recovery. Importantly, for a minority of recipients, psychological debriefing may actually result in worse adjustment (McNally et al., 2003; Rose et al., 2009). Access to treatment for those staff who require management of established trauma-related mental health problems such as PTSD (e.g. trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy and Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing which are known to be effective [NICE 2005 in Greenberg et al., 2015]) may be required. Importantly, extra funding may be needed for this, and it will be important that there is equity of access and that this is available to nurses as well as other members of the healthcare team. Clearly, to ""get through"" this unprecedented situation, some resilience is needed but nurses need their employers, their teams, the profession and the public to support them with action and resources. #ClappingForTheCarers and publicly applauding front-line staff daily/ weekly throughout Europe is helping to lift spirits, and some nurses report feeling moved at the collective acknowledgement of gratitude and donation of gifts such as food and other gifts. There are also reports of teams pulling together in cooperative effort and great camaraderie in emergency departments and intensive care units to name but a few. But this is not enough, nurses also need to feel their needs are cared for and that they are safe with adequate PPE equipment in all settings where health and social care are being delivered. They need access to rest breaks, good peer and team support and leaders that will continue to care for them well after the pandemic is over. As researchers who have studied nurse well-being for decades, it is gratifying to see the increased focus on healthcare staff well-being, yet sad that it takes a pandemic to recognise its critical importance. Yes, staff will need ""resilience"" but resilience must never be seen as an individual responsibility, it is a collective and organisational responsibility. Evidence from the military suggests the resilience of the team appears to be ""more related to the bonds between team members than the psychological make-up or coping styles of any individual"" (Greenberg et al., 2015). The word ""resilience"" (and resilience training) is now rightly contested as staff can feel it is another stick to beat them with; if staff are stressed and struggling psychologically (through lack of resources or ethical and emotional challenges as in COVID-19), nurses can feel it is their ""fault"" because they have not implemented the training adequately or been ""resilient enough."" This is neither true not acceptable. Let this be an opportunity to fully recognise the inherent stresses and emotional strain that nurses bear on behalf of society and ensure support, not only through this crisis but after it is all over. When health care is back to ""normal,"" ongoing support for nurses' well-being will remain critically important. While COVID-19 places particularly high stress on nursing, there is very little in the guidance presented here that was not relevant to staff well-being ""pre-COVID"" and when the pandemic is over, we look forward to the guidelines being used to establish better support for nurses and nursing into the future. We are grateful to our colleagues for their support in the development of this work.

W4304943299,Ethical principles for artificial intelligence in education,"The advancement of artificial intelligence in education (AIED) has the potential to transform the educational landscape and influence the role of all involved stakeholders. In recent years, the applications of AIED have been gradually adopted to progress our understanding of students' learning and enhance learning performance and experience. However, the adoption of AIED has led to increasing ethical risks and concerns regarding several aspects such as personal data and learner autonomy. Despite the recent announcement of guidelines for ethical and trustworthy AIED, the debate revolves around the key principles underpinning ethical AIED. This paper aims to explore whether there is a global consensus on ethical AIED by mapping and analyzing international organizations' current policies and guidelines. In this paper, we first introduce the opportunities offered by AI in education and potential ethical issues. Then, thematic analysis was conducted to conceptualize and establish a set of ethical principles by examining and synthesizing relevant ethical policies and guidelines for AIED. We discuss each principle and associated implications for relevant educational stakeholders, including students, teachers, technology developers, policymakers, and institutional decision-makers. The proposed set of ethical principles is expected to serve as a framework to inform and guide educational stakeholders in the development and deployment of ethical and trustworthy AIED as well as catalyze future development of related impact studies in the field.",2022-10-13,2022,Andy Nguyen; Ha Ngan Ngo; Yvonne Hong; Belle Dang; Bich-Phuong Thi Nguyen,Victoria University of Wellington,Education and Information Technologies,637,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-022-11316-w,Cybersecurity,Autonomy; Engineering ethics; Underpinning; Trustworthiness; Set (abstract data type),0.433

W4321054304,"Effectiveness of physical activity interventions for improving depression, anxiety and distress: an overview of systematic reviews","Objective To synthesise the evidence on the effects of physical activity on symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological distress in adult populations. Design Umbrella review. Data sources Twelve electronic databases were searched for eligible studies published from inception to 1 January 2022. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials designed to increase physical activity in an adult population and that assessed depression, anxiety or psychological distress were eligible. Study selection was undertaken in duplicate by two independent reviewers. Results Ninety-seven reviews (1039 trials and 128 119 participants) were included. Populations included healthy adults, people with mental health disorders and people with various chronic diseases. Most reviews (n=77) had a critically low A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews score. Physical activity had medium effects on depression (median effect size=−0.43, IQR=−0.66 to –0.27), anxiety (median effect size=−0.42, IQR=−0.66 to –0.26) and psychological distress (effect size=−0.60, 95% CI −0.78 to –0.42), compared with usual care across all populations. The largest benefits were seen in people with depression, HIV and kidney disease, in pregnant and postpartum women, and in healthy individuals. Higher intensity physical activity was associated with greater improvements in symptoms. Effectiveness of physical activity interventions diminished with longer duration interventions. Conclusion and relevance Physical activity is highly beneficial for improving symptoms of depression, anxiety and distress across a wide range of adult populations, including the general population, people with diagnosed mental health disorders and people with chronic disease. Physical activity should be a mainstay approach in the management of depression, anxiety and psychological distress.

W4308821586,A comprehensive guide to the physics and usage of PYTHIA 8.3,"This manual describes the Pythia event generator, the most recent version of an evolving physics tool used to answer fundamental questions in particle physics. The program is most often used to generate high-energy-physics collision “events”, i.e. sets of particles produced in association with the collision of two incoming high-energy particles, but has several uses beyond that. The guiding philosophy is to produce and re-produce properties of experimentally obtained collisions as accurately as possible. The program includes a wide ranges of reactions within and beyond the Standard Model, and extending to heavy ion physics. Emphasis is put on phenomena where strong interactions play a major role. The manual contains both pedagogical and practical components. All included physics models are described in enough detail to allow the user to obtain a cursory overview of used assumptions and approximations, enabling an informed evaluation of the program output. A number of the most central algorithms are described in enough detail that the main results of the program can be reproduced independently, allowing further development of existing models or the addition of new ones. Finally, a chapter dedicated fully to the user is included towards the end, providing pedagogical examples of standard use cases, and a detailed description of a number of external interfaces.

W3093959671,"Root traits as drivers of plant and ecosystem functioning: current understanding, pitfalls and future research needs","Summary The effects of plants on the biosphere, atmosphere and geosphere are key determinants of terrestrial ecosystem functioning. However, despite substantial progress made regarding plant belowground components, we are still only beginning to explore the complex relationships between root traits and functions. Drawing on the literature in plant physiology, ecophysiology, ecology, agronomy and soil science, we reviewed 24 aspects of plant and ecosystem functioning and their relationships with a number of root system traits, including aspects of architecture, physiology, morphology, anatomy, chemistry, biomechanics and biotic interactions. Based on this assessment, we critically evaluated the current strengths and gaps in our knowledge, and identify future research challenges in the field of root ecology. Most importantly, we found that belowground traits with the broadest importance in plant and ecosystem functioning are not those most commonly measured. Also, the estimation of trait relative importance for functioning requires us to consider a more comprehensive range of functionally relevant traits from a diverse range of species, across environments and over time series. We also advocate that establishing causal hierarchical links among root traits will provide a hypothesis‐based framework to identify the most parsimonious sets of traits with the strongest links on functions, and to link genotypes to plant and ecosystem functioning.",2020-11-07,2020,Grégoire T.

W4311487064,What factors contribute to the acceptance of artificial intelligence? A systematic review,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are predicted to infiltrate most industries within the next decade, creating a personal, industrial, and social shift towards the new technology. As a result, there has been a surge of interest and research towards user acceptance of AI technology in recent years. However, the existing research appears dispersed and lacks systematic synthesis, limiting our understanding of user acceptance of AI technologies. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-Analysis guidelines using five databases: EBSCO host, Embase, Inspec (Engineering Village host), Scopus, and Web of Science. Papers were required to focus on both user acceptance and AI technology. Acceptance was defined as the behavioural intention or willingness to use, buy, or try a good or service. A total of 7912 articles were identified in the database search. Sixty articles were included in the review. Most studies (n = 31) did not define AI in their papers, and 38 studies did not define AI for their participants. The extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was the most frequently used theory to assess user acceptance of AI technologies. Perceived usefulness, performance expectancy, attitudes, trust, and effort expectancy significantly and positively predicted behavioural intention, willingness, and use behaviour of AI across multiple industries. However, in some cultural scenarios, it appears that the need for human contact cannot be replicated or replaced by AI, no matter the perceived usefulness or perceived ease of use.

W3037663607,A systematic scoping review of sustainable tourism indicators in relation to the sustainable development goals,"Sustainable tourism indicators (STIs) are an integral element of tourism planning and management. This study systematically reviews the research contributions on the development of STIs based on four criteria including: i) the relevance of the STIs to the sustainable development goals (SDGs); ii) governance; iii) stakeholders involved; and iv) the distinction between subjective and objective indicators. A search of Scopus indexed journals published up to April 2018, yielded 97 papers for examination. The findings demonstrate the lack of direct attention to the SDGs in those papers published after their launch in 2016. However, the majority of the SDGs and their targets have indirectly been covered in the reviewed papers. The results revealed that, among the sustainability themes of economic growth, social inclusion, environmental protection, and governance, the STIs studies tended to overlook the dimension of governance. The findings showed that residents are the most engaged stakeholder group, and tourists the least engaged as compared with government and businesses. The results also indicated that more attention is afforded to objective compared to subjective indicators. The findings also demonstrated that much of the focus is on European countries rather than the Global South which is the major focus of the SDGs.",2020-06-24,2020,S.

W3127734604,"Autonomy-supportive teaching: Its malleability, benefits, and potential to improve educational practice","Autonomy-supportive teaching is the adoption of a student-focused attitude and an understanding interpersonal tone that enables the skillful enactment of seven autonomy-satisfying instructional behaviors to serve two purposes—support intrinsic motivation and support internalization. Using self-determination theory principles and empirical findings, researchers have developed and implemented numerous teacher-focused and methodologically-rigorous interventions to provide teachers with the professional developmental experience they need to learn how to become more autonomy supportive. The findings from 51 autonomy-supportive teaching interventions (including 38 randomized control trials) collectively show that (1) teachers can learn how to become more autonomy supportive during instruction (autonomy-supportive teaching is malleable) and, once learned, (2) this greater autonomy-supportive teaching produces a wide range of educationally important student, teacher, and classroom climate benefits (autonomy-supportive teaching is beneficial). Recognizing this, the article shows how the recent surge in autonomy-supportive intervention research has advanced the conceptual understanding of the nature of autonomy-supportive teaching and clarified its potential to improve educational practice.",2021-01-02,2021,Johnmarshall Reeve; Sung Hyeon Cheon,Australian Catholic University,Educational Psychologist,499,https://doi.org/10.1080/00461520.2020.1862657,Cybersecurity,Autonomy; Psychology; Psychological intervention; Interpersonal communication; Intervention (counseling),0.15
W3119209496,Underestimating the Challenges of Avoiding a Ghastly Future,"We report three major and confronting environmental issues that have received little attention and require urgent action. First, we review the evidence that future environmental conditions will be far more dangerous than currently believed. The scale of the threats to the biosphere and all its lifeforms — including humanity — is in fact so great that it is difficult to grasp for even well-informed experts. Second, we ask what political or economic system, or leadership, is prepared to handle the predicted disasters, or even capable of such action. Third, this dire situation places an extraordinary responsibility on scientists to speak out candidly and accurately when engaging with government, business, and the public. We especially draw attention to the lack of appreciation of the enormous challenges to creating a sustainable future. The added stresses to human health, wealth, and well-being will perversely diminish our political capacity to mitigate the erosion of ecosystem services on which society depends. The science underlying these issues is strong, but awareness is weak. Without fully appreciating and broadcasting the scale of the problems and the enormity of the solutions required, society will fail to achieve even modest sustainability goals.",2021-01-13,2021,Corey J.

W3157337874,Patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs): A review of generic and condition‐specific measures and a discussion of trends and issues,"Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are questionnaires that collect health outcomes directly from the people who experience them. This review critically synthesizes information on generic and selected condition-specific PROMs to describe trends and contemporary issues regarding their development, validation and application.We reviewed academic and grey literature on validated PROMs by searching databases, prominent websites, Google Scholar and Google Search. The identification of condition-specific PROMs was limited to common conditions and those with a high burden of disease (eg cancers, cardiovascular disorders). Trends and contemporary issues in the development, validation and application of PROMs were critically evaluated.The search yielded 315 generic and condition-specific PROMs. The largest numbers of measures were identified for generic PROMs, musculoskeletal conditions and cancers. The earliest published PROMs were in mental health-related conditions. The number of PROMs grew substantially between 1980s and 2000s but slowed more recently. The number of publications discussing PROMs continues to increase. Issues identified include the use of computer-adaptive testing and increasing concerns about the appropriateness of using PROMs developed and validated for specific purposes (eg research) for other reasons (eg clinical decision making).The term PROM is a relatively new designation for a range of measures that have existed since at least the 1960s.

W3012750821,Life in the pandemic: Some reflections on nursing in the context of COVID‐19,"In the unparalleled and extraordinary public health emergency in which we find ourselves, across the world nurses stand as we always do—at the front line. Nurses everywhere are staffing our clinics, hospital wards and units—in some situations, literally working until they drop, and in some regions, they are doing so while dealing with a lack of essential items. Indeed, we see reports that nurses in many parts of the world are grappling with shortages of much-needed supplies including personal protective equipments such as masks, gloves and gowns, yet are actively embracing the challenges presented by COVID-19. As we contemplate the ramifications of this rapidly moving global pandemic, it is clear that the need for nurses has never been greater. In responding to this dire and unprecedented health crisis, as nurses, we are doing what we have been educated and prepared to do. As nurses, we have the knowledge and skills to deliver the care needed in all phases of the illness trajectory, and in reassuring, informing and supporting people within communities who are frightened, worried and wanting to stay well. As we have seen throughout history, nurses are well able to think outside the box, and develop creative and innovative solutions to all manner of problems, conundrums and challenges. However, there remains much about this current situation that is new and frightening. For one is the speed of the spread of COVID-19. In the fight against COVID-19, we are working against the clock. The trajectory of this situation is such that in some areas, infection rates are doubling every 24 hr or so, and this is leading to increasing community anxiety manifesting in various ways including panic buying and hoarding of essential supplies. It is clear that this health crisis will not affect everyone in the same way. The very strong public health message is to stay home, and stay safe within that home, in the assumption that everyone has a home that is safe, and within which they have some autonomy. There is some speculation as to whether rates of domestic violence might increase at this time as a result of the extraordinary strain that families face. Poverty is also an issue. It is well known and accepted that those who are homeless and impoverished have many less options when faced with health problems, and the challenges faced by these people will be much greater in this time of pandemic (Tsai & Wilson, 2020). Similarly, people who are captive or imprisoned for any reason, such as in corrections or refugee environments and other similar settings, are particularly vulnerable (Iacobucci, 2020). Older adults are high users of services across primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare settings. Many in this group live with multiple health and social issues that increase their vulnerability, now further exacerbated by the need for social distancing. Older people are known to be at greater risk of calamitous outcomes associated with COVID-19, and this dire picture is likely to be exacerbated because of the potential for rationing of care based on age, simply because there are not enough ventilators and other life-saving equipments to meet demand. The risk to older people is greater than to others, and in many countries, limitations on older people activities are in place in attempts to reduce risk of exposure. In several countries, restrictions on visiting nursing homes are in place and people over 70 years of age asked to reduce outings and remain indoors as much as possible to decrease contact with others and reduce the risk of contracting the virus. While necessary, this could put older people at risk of loneliness, isolation and exacerbation of existing problems, and so it is very important that we all look out for older people in our neighbourhoods and provide support, assistance and safe social interaction as required. Nurses are at the forefront in institutional settings such as nursing homes and prisons, with homeless people, and other hard to reach populations and are grappling with the effects of low health literacy, rapidity of change and health information, and a lack of resources to ensure that all know and understand what is required to keep them safe. It is so important that we all support these vulnerable populations and the nurses working within them by advocating for resources including adequate safe accommodation for all. We know from our colleagues that despite being actively engaged in this fight against COVID-19, in a way that few other professions are, and despite appearing calm and professional; like everyone else, many nurses are also experiencing fear of the unknown and concern for what lies ahead, for themselves, their patients, colleagues and their own families and friends. In addition to being nurses, we are also parents, siblings, friends and partners with all of the worries and concerns shared by most people—providing for and protecting ourselves and our families, and so in addition to caring for patients, the well-being of our own families weighs heavily on us as nurses at this time. The global nature of this crisis means that while all countries are engaged in the battle against COVID-19, some have been in the fight for longer and so there is the opportunity to learn from other countries. Indeed, in watching the unfolding horror particularly in Italy, we see just what can (and will) happen in the event that measures such as social distancing, hand hygiene and quarantine are not fully embraced by all in our communities. Earlier this year, Hong Kong was one of the first places in the world affected by the COVID-19 virus, evoking unwanted memories of the SARS outbreak of 2003 (Smith, Ng, & Ho Cheung Li, 2020). Despite initial fears, the spread of the virus appeared to have been effectively controlled over the last two months through the use of stringent measures, including practice of good personal hygiene, avoidance of group gatherings and implementation of social isolation measures. Indeed, by the beginning of March 2020 some public services in Hong Kong had started to resume normal activity and many people were returning to the workplace. In some part, these successes were due to the excellence of the clinical nursing workforce. We saw some stability in other countries in the same region including Singapore and Taiwan. There was hope that the corner had been turned in the fight against COVID-19; however, this has turned out not to be the case. Very recently, Hong Kong and several other South-East Asian countries have started to face the second wave of imported coronavirus infections, with the total number of cases in Hong Kong doubling during this period. The vast majority of these new cases have involved people flying to South-East Asia from abroad, especially students returning from North America and Europe, where COVID-19 infection has been escalating. Singapore and Taiwan, which had each taken comfort from seeing new infections taper off in recent weeks, have also seen surges of COVID-19 cases amongst arrivals in recent days. Health officials from these densely populated countries are now struggling to contain the new cases to avoid any new community outbreaks. A similar picture emerged in mainland China. After some sustained and marked reductions in the spread of the virus, China's National Health Commission have recently announced that all new reported cases were imported from overseas. Despite many people fully recovering from COVID-19 infection in China, there has been some concern that a new subset of patients affected by the virus may be emerging. There are reports that a handful of the many thousands of people declared cured after treatment have been readmitted to hospitals because their symptoms have returned. At the time of writing, this worrying feature of COVID-19 infection is only beginning to receive attention by the medical community, but clearly requires close consideration in the ongoing global fight against COVID-19. Across the world, there are concerns that nursing's capacity to provide care will be stretched by the increased workload and by the number of front-line nurses that are expected to be affected by COVID-19. In Australia, authorities are considering various mechanisms such as fast-tracking return to registration of qualified nurses who may be recently retired and allowing limited registration to people who may be suitable such as internationally qualified nurses. In the United Kingdom, there has also been a call for recently retired nurses to return to practice. Other planned strategies include establishing a COVID-19 temporary register for nurses who have left the register within the past three years, who will be able to opt into this register. Registered nurses not currently working clinically will be encouraged to consider working within clinical practice, and undergraduate nursing students will be able to opt to undertake the final six months of their programme as a clinical placement. Part of the COVID-19 temporary register is to include a specific student element for those in the final six months of their preregistration programme and will include details of specific conditions to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place. The fine details are still in development, and there may need to be further measures in what is a continually changing situation. In considering introducing new cadres of nurses, there are also issues around risk, retraining, refreshing and renewing knowledge. While there are some aspects of nursing that may not have changed too much over the years, health is generally a rapidly evolving field and particularly in the current situation. In contemplating returning to direct care giving roles, many retired nurses or others contemplating re-entry may have legitimate concerns about the real contribution that they could make in the current crises, particularly when considering direct care delivery and technological advancements in practice. It will be necessary to consider carefully any possible risk for nurses returning from retirement, and the potential ways these nurses could meaningfully contribute. This may be in working in quieter areas to free up current staff, and working in roles supporting front-line nurses. Either way, it will be crucial to have adequate learning and resourcing available to support these new cadres of nurses. However, as we identify innovative ways to provide a nursing workforce during this time of urgency, it is important that whatever we implement is safe and appropriate for staff and for patients. Patient safety is paramount and integral to nursing practice. Nurses generally become nurses because of the desire to help people regain and maintain optimal health, and here, we have a situation where there may be very few options to help those who are seriously ill because of COVID-19. This inability to save lives will take its toll on those at the front line, both physically and emotionally. As nurses, we know death. We have seen loss of life, and we have borne witness to the pain and the suffering of the dying and the grief of those left behind. For nurses, particularly in environments where the focus is on life preserving, such as emergency departments and intensive care units, death can represent failure, and so is therefore a source of stress and distress for the medical and nursing teams in these settings. We are now in a situation where nurses everywhere are bracing for what really is a tsunami of death. Our colleagues in China and Italy have and are leading the way, and we have seen reports and first-hand accounts of the distress and exhaustion of our Chinese and Italian colleagues who have been (and are) faced with large-scale death on a daily basis. All aspects of nursing activity are affected by this pandemic, and healthcare facilities have responded to nursing education student clinical needs in a variety of ways. Some have restricted student presence in their organisations, while others welcome healthy students. Academic nurses have also been quick to modify in the light of the crisis caused by COVID-19 and many have very quickly moved to online course delivery, including strategising to ensure reasonable student engagement, and making appropriate changes to examination procedures. There is also the need to recognise that many nurses currently enrolled in post-graduate courses may now have their current studies jeopardised because of cancellation of study leave or other pre-existing work patterns that can now no longer be guaranteed. Nurse educators and administrators are tasked with ensuring that students meet academic requirements while recognising the current pressures faced by health services and the need for nurses to be able to simultaneously meet the demands on them as nurses, students, parents, siblings, partners and the myriad of other roles that each nurse has to manage in their daily lives. The way this crisis has unfolded has meant that we have all sorts of new challenges in seeking to meet the health needs of our populations. For example, we have situations of cruise ships left sailing from port-to-port unable to dock; others inadvertently offloading passengers who are ill and contagious into communities, with health services left to set about tracing crew, passengers and those with whom they have been into contact. We have to prepare for the potential ramifications if COVID-19 takes hold in very vulnerable populations, such as prisons where it will be very hard to contain because of the proximity of people. There is also the aftermath to consider. Of critical importance will be nurses' responses to the increased anxiety and mental health needs of the population as well as within the nursing community. These are very difficult times, and the scale of the challenges is unprecedented. Every single one of us has a role to play in supporting and advocating for the health of our communities, and in supporting nurses everywhere. Nurses are the backbone of health systems around the world, and this has never been more apparent than now. Amidst all the uncertainty about the virus and how long it might take before life begins to return to normal, there can be no doubt that nursing and the provision of health care will come out the other side of this pandemic stronger and better prepared to face future challenges. We write these ""reflections"" in the moment, as the impacts of the pandemic unfold around us daily. We are all living it right now. When it is over, we look back and reflect upon it and with the benefit of hindsight, might make normative judgements regarding what we ought to have done and what might have been best at a certain time. Right now, we all need to be kind to each other (and ourselves) as we grapple with new ways of living and working. We want to thank nurses everywhere for their tireless efforts in this unparalleled health emergency.",2020-03-25,2020,Debra Jackson; Caroline Bradbury‐Jones; Diana Baptiste; Leslie Gelling; Karen H.

W3139291660,Methodological Considerations for Studies in Sport and Exercise Science with Women as Participants: A Working Guide for Standards of Practice for Research on Women,"Abstract Until recently, there has been less demand for and interest in female-specific sport and exercise science data. As a result, the vast majority of high-quality sport and exercise science data have been derived from studies with men as participants, which reduces the application of these data due to the known physiological differences between the sexes, specifically with regard to reproductive endocrinology. Furthermore, a shortage of specialist knowledge on female physiology in the sport science community, coupled with a reluctance to effectively adapt experimental designs to incorporate female-specific considerations, such as the menstrual cycle, hormonal contraceptive use, pregnancy and the menopause, has slowed the pursuit of knowledge in this field of research. In addition, a lack of agreement on the terminology and methodological approaches (i.e., gold-standard techniques) used within this research area has further hindered the ability of researchers to adequately develop evidenced-based guidelines for female exercisers. The purpose of this paper was to highlight the specific considerations needed when employing women (i.e., from athletes to non-athletes) as participants in sport and exercise science-based research. These considerations relate to participant selection criteria and adaptations for experimental design and address the diversity and complexities associated with female reproductive endocrinology across the lifespan. This statement intends to promote an increase in the inclusion of women as participants in studies related to sport and exercise science and an enhanced execution of these studies resulting in more high-quality female-specific data.",2021-03-16,2021,Kirsty J.

W3080688640,"A starting guide to root ecology: strengthening ecological concepts and standardising root classification, sampling, processing and trait measurements","Summary In the context of a recent massive increase in research on plant root functions and their impact on the environment, root ecologists currently face many important challenges to keep on generating cutting‐edge, meaningful and integrated knowledge. Consideration of the below‐ground components in plant and ecosystem studies has been consistently called for in recent decades, but methodology is disparate and sometimes inappropriate. This handbook, based on the collective effort of a large team of experts, will improve trait comparisons across studies and integration of information across databases by providing standardised methods and controlled vocabularies. It is meant to be used not only as starting point by students and scientists who desire working on below‐ground ecosystems, but also by experts for consolidating and broadening their views on multiple aspects of root ecology. Beyond the classical compilation of measurement protocols, we have synthesised recommendations from the literature to provide key background knowledge useful for: (1) defining below‐ground plant entities and giving keys for their meaningful dissection, classification and naming beyond the classical fine‐root vs coarse‐root approach; (2) considering the specificity of root research to produce sound laboratory and field data; (3) describing typical, but overlooked steps for studying roots (e.g. root handling, cleaning and storage); and (4) gathering metadata necessary for the interpretation of results and their reuse. Most importantly, all root traits have been introduced with some degree of ecological context that will be a foundation for understanding their ecological meaning, their typical use and uncertainties, and some methodological and conceptual perspectives for future research. Considering all of this, we urge readers not to solely extract protocol recommendations for trait measurements from this work, but to take a moment to read and reflect on the extensive information contained in this broader guide to root ecology, including sections I–VII and the many introductions to each section and root trait description. Finally, it is critical to understand that a major aim of this guide is to help break down barriers between the many subdisciplines of root ecology and ecophysiology, broaden researchers’ views on the multiple aspects of root study and create favourable conditions for the inception of comprehensive experiments on the role of roots in plant and ecosystem functioning.",2021-10-05,2021,Grégoire T.

W3036558031,A production recovery plan in manufacturing supply chains for a high-demand item during COVID-19,"Purpose A recent global pandemic, known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), affects the manufacturing supply chains most significantly. This effect becomes more challenging for the manufacturers of high-demand and most essential items, such as toilet paper and hand sanitizer. In a pandemic situation, the demand of the essential products increases expressively; on the other hand, the supply of the raw materials decreases considerably with a constraint of production capacity. These dual disruptions impact the production process suddenly, and the process can collapse without immediate and necessary actions. To minimize the impacts of these dual disruptions, we aim to develop a recovery model for making a decision on the revised production plan. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the authors use a mathematical modeling approach to develop a production recovery model for a high-demand and essential item during the COVID-19. The authors also analyze the properties of the recovery plan, and optimize the recovery plan to maximize the profit in the recovery window. Findings The authors analyze the results using a numerical example. The result shows that the developed recovery model is capable of revising the production plan in the situations of both demand and supply disruptions, and improves the profit for the manufacturers. The authors also discuss the managerial implications, including the roles of digital technologies in the recovery process. Originality/value This model, which is a novel contribution to the literature, will help decision-makers of high-demand and essential items to make an accurate and prompt decision in designing the revised production plan to recover during a pandemic, like COVID-19.",2020-06-19,2020,Sanjoy Kumar Paul; Priyabrata Chowdhury,University of Technology Sydney,International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management,437,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijpdlm-04-2020-0127,Cybersecurity,Supply chain; Profit (economics); Production (economics); Computer science; Business,0.375
W3014565015,Improving the translation of search strategies using the Polyglot Search Translator: a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Searching for studies to include in a systematic review (SR) is a time- and labor-intensive process with searches of multiple databases recommended. To reduce the time spent translating search strings across databases, a tool called the Polyglot Search Translator (PST) was developed. The authors evaluated whether using the PST as a search translation aid reduces the time required to translate search strings without increasing errors.Methods: In a randomized trial, twenty participants were randomly allocated ten database search strings and then randomly assigned to translate five with the assistance of the PST (PST-A method) and five without the assistance of the PST (manual method). We compared the time taken to translate search strings, the number of errors made, and how close the number of references retrieved by a translated search was to the number retrieved by a reference standard translation.Results: Sixteen participants performed 174 translations using the PST-A method and 192 translations using the manual method. The mean time taken to translate a search string with the PST-A method was 31 minutes versus 45 minutes by the manual method (mean difference: 14 minutes). The mean number of errors made per translation by the PST-A method was 8.6 versus 14.6 by the manual method. Large variation in the number of references retrieved makes results for this outcome unreliable, although the number of references retrieved by the PST-A method was closer to the reference standard translation than the manual method.Conclusion: When used to assist with translating search strings across databases, the PST can increase the speed of translation without increasing errors. Errors in search translations can still be a problem, and search specialists should be aware of this.",2020-04-01,2020,Justin Clark; Sharon Sanders; Matt Carter; David Honeyman; Gina Cleo,Bond University,Journal of the Medical Library Association JMLA,428,https://doi.org/10.5195/jmla.2020.834,Cybersecurity,Polyglot; Computer science; String (physics); Information retrieval; Natural language processing,0.15
W3086442239,Association Between Maternal Perinatal Depression and Anxiety and Child and Adolescent Development,"There is widespread interest in associations between maternal perinatal depression and anxiety and offspring development; however, to date, there has been no systematic, meta-analytic review on the long-term developmental outcomes spanning infancy through adolescence. To provide a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the extant literature on associations between maternal perinatal depression and anxiety and social-emotional, cognitive, language, motor, and adaptability outcomes in offspring during the first 18 years of life. Six databases were searched (CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, Embase, Informit, MEDLINE Complete, and PsycInfo) for all extant studies reporting associations between perinatal maternal mental health problems and offspring development to March 1, 2020. Studies were included if they were published in English; had a human sample, quantitative data, a longitudinal design, and measures of perinatal depression and/or anxiety and social-emotional, cognitive, language, motor, and/or adaptability development in offspring; and investigated an association between perinatal depression or anxiety and childhood development. Of 27 212 articles identified, 191 were eligible for meta-analysis. Data were extracted by multiple independent observers and pooled using a fixed- or a random-effects model. A series of meta-regressions were also conducted. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2019, to March 15, 2020. Primary outcomes included social-emotional, cognitive, language, motor, and adaptability development in offspring during the first 18 years of life. After screening, 191 unique studies were eligible for meta-analysis, with a combined sample of 195 751 unique mother-child dyads. Maternal perinatal depression and anxiety were associated with poorer offspring social-emotional (antenatal period, r = 0.21 [95% CI, 0.16-0.27]; postnatal period, r = 0.24 [95% CI, 0.19-0.28]), cognitive (antenatal period, r = -0.12 [95% CI, -0.19 to -0.05]; postnatal period, r = -0.25 [95% CI, -0.39 to -0.09]), language (antenatal period, r = -0.11 [95% CI, -0.20 to 0.02]; postnatal period, r = -0.22 [95% CI, -0.40 to 0.03]), motor (antenatal period, r = -0.07 [95% CI, -0.18 to 0.03]; postnatal period, r = -0.07 [95% CI, -0.16 to 0.03]), and adaptive behavior (antenatal period, r = -0.26 [95% CI, -0.39 to -0.12]) development. Findings extended beyond infancy, into childhood and adolescence. Meta-regressions confirmed the robustness of the results. Evidence suggests that perinatal depression and anxiety in mothers are adversely associated with offspring development and therefore are important targets for prevention and early intervention to support mothers transitioning into parenthood and the health and well-being of next-generation offspring.",2020-09-14,2020,Alana Rogers; Shelley Obst; Samantha Teague; Larissa Rossen; Elizabeth Spry,Deakin University,JAMA Pediatrics,428,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.2910,Cybersecurity,Anxiety; Medicine; Offspring; PsycINFO; CINAHL,0.433

Trustworthy research is robust, rigorous, and transparent at all stages of design, execution, and reporting. Assessment of researchers still rarely includes considerations related to trustworthiness, rigor, and transparency. We have developed the Hong Kong Principles (HKPs) as part of the 6th World Conference on Research Integrity with a specific focus on the need to drive research improvement through ensuring that researchers are explicitly recognized and rewarded for behaviors that strengthen research integrity. We present five principles: responsible research practices; transparent reporting; open science (open research); valuing a diversity of types of research; and recognizing all contributions to research and scholarly activity. For each principle, we provide a rationale for its inclusion and provide examples where these principles are already being adopted.",2020-07-16,2020,David Moher; L.M.

We invited 220 systematic review methodologists and journal editors to complete a survey about the suggested modifications. The results of these projects were discussed at a 21-member in-person meeting. Following the meeting, we drafted the PRISMA 2020 statement and refined it based on feedback from co-authors and a convenience sample of 15 systematic reviewers. Results: The review of 60 documents revealed that all topics addressed by the PRISMA 2009 statement could be modified. Of the 110 survey respondents, more than 66% recommended keeping six of the original checklist items as they were and modifying 15 of them using wording suggested by us. Attendees at the in-person meeting supported the revised wording for several items but suggested rewording for most to enhance clarity, and further refinements were made over six drafts of the guideline. Conclusions: The PRISMA 2020 statement consists of updated reporting guidance for systematic reviews.

Unlike other chronic diseases with established strategies for screening, there has been no consensus on whether health systems and governments should prioritize early identification and intervention for CKD. Guidelines on evaluating and managing early CKD are available but have not been universally adopted in the absence of incentives or quality measures for prioritizing CKD care. The burden of CKD falls disproportionately upon persons with lower socioeconomic status, who have a higher prevalence of CKD, limited access to treatment, and poorer outcomes. Therefore, identifying and treating CKD at the earliest stages is an equity imperative. In 2019, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a controversies conference entitled ""Early Identification and Intervention in CKD."" Participants identified strategies for screening, risk stratification, and treatment for early CKD and the key health system and economic factors for implementing these processes. A consensus emerged that CKD screening coupled with risk stratification and treatment should be implemented immediately for high-risk persons and that this should ideally occur in primary or community care settings with tailoring to the local context.",2020-10-27,2020,Michael G.

W3019945581,Federated Learning With Blockchain for Autonomous Vehicles: Analysis and Design Challenges,"We propose an autonomous blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) design for privacy-aware and efficient vehicular communication networking, where local on-vehicle machine learning (oVML) model updates are exchanged and verified in a distributed fashion. BFL enables oVML without any centralized training data or coordination by utilizing the consensus mechanism of the blockchain. Relying on a renewal reward approach, we develop a mathematical framework that features the controllable network and BFL parameters (e.g., the retransmission limit, block size, block arrival rate, and the frame sizes) so as to capture their impact on the system-level performance. More importantly, our rigorous analysis of oVML system dynamics quantifies the end-to-end delay with BFL, which provides important insights into deriving optimal block arrival rate by considering communication and consensus delays. We present a variety of numerical and simulation results highlighting various non-trivial findings and insights for adaptive BFL design. In particular, based on analytical results, we minimize the system delay by exploiting the channel dynamics and demonstrate that the proposed idea of tuning the block arrival rate is provably online and capable of driving the system dynamics to the desired operating point. It also identifies the improved dependency on other blockchain parameters for a given set of channel conditions, retransmission limits, and frame sizes. <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">1</sup> However, a number of challenges (gaps in knowledge) need to be resolved in order to realise these changes.

W3216306687,"Corporate ESG reporting quantity, quality and performance: Where to now for environmental policy and practice?","Environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues are driving corporate strategy and performance. However, does this mean more ESG reporting is being done? If so, is the quality of ESG reports improving? And what about ESG performance? In this paper, we examine these three trends in ESG reporting—quantity, quality and corporate ESG performance. With a Swedish multinational corporate focus, we analyse data from Sustainalytics, corporateregister.com and the Alliance for Corporate Transparency to answer our research questions. Our analysis shows that, while the quality of ESG information in Sweden has steadily improved, performance plateaued around 2015. Mitigating problems such as the impacts of climate change and COVID-19 call for improved ESG performance, not improved ESG reporting quantity or quality. Thus, rather than focusing on improving ESG reporting regulations, we need to redirect our focus towards creating better ESG outcomes. Therefore, we argue that companies must be asked to provide data that are more timely, relevant, credible and comparable and that demonstrate improved ESG performance. With this information, financial analysts and investors can redirect and accelerate capital flows towards corporate investments that help tackle important problems related to climate crises and the reaching of a sustainable development. Our analysis reveals that we need more research focusing on consumers, investors and policymakers.

W3119464696,MnO<sub>2</sub>‐Based Materials for Environmental Applications,"Abstract Manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) is a promising photo–thermo–electric‐responsive semiconductor material for environmental applications, owing to its various favorable properties. However, the unsatisfactory environmental purification efficiency of this material has limited its further applications. Fortunately, in the last few years, significant efforts have been undertaken for improving the environmental purification efficiency of this material and understanding its underlying mechanism. Here, the aim is to summarize the recent experimental and computational research progress in the modification of MnO 2 single species by morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping. Moreover, the design and fabrication of MnO 2 ‐based composites via the construction of homojunctions and MnO 2 /semiconductor/conductor binary/ternary heterojunctions is discussed. Their applications in environmental purification systems, either as an adsorbent material for removing heavy metals, dyes, and microwave (MW) pollution, or as a thermal catalyst, photocatalyst, and electrocatalyst for the degradation of pollutants (water and gas, organic and inorganic) are also highlighted. Finally, the research gaps are summarized and a perspective on the challenges and the direction of future research in nanostructured MnO 2 ‐based materials in the field of environmental applications is presented. Therefore, basic guidance for rational design and fabrication of high‐efficiency MnO 2 ‐based materials for comprehensive environmental applications is provided.",2021-01-14,2021,Ruijie Yang; Yingying Fan; Ruquan Ye; Yuxin Tang; Xiehong Cao,Australian National University,Advanced Materials,388,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202004862,Cybersecurity,Materials science; Environmental pollution; Nanotechnology; Fabrication; Environmentally friendly,0.3
W3120880088,Mental health consequences of COVID-19 media coverage: the need for effective crisis communication practices,"Abstract During global pandemics, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), crisis communication is indispensable in dispelling fears, uncertainty, and unifying individuals worldwide in a collective fight against health threats. Inadequate crisis communication can bring dire personal and economic consequences. Mounting research shows that seemingly endless newsfeeds related to COVID-19 infection and death rates could considerably increase the risk of mental health problems. Unfortunately, media reports that include infodemics regarding the influence of COVID-19 on mental health may be a source of the adverse psychological effects on individuals. Owing partially to insufficient crisis communication practices, media and news organizations across the globe have played minimal roles in battling COVID-19 infodemics. Common refrains include raging QAnon conspiracies, a false and misleading “Chinese virus” narrative, and the use of disinfectants to “cure” COVID-19. With the potential to deteriorate mental health, infodemics fueled by a kaleidoscopic range of misinformation can be dangerous. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of research on how to improve crisis communication across media and news organization channels. This paper identifies ways that legacy media reports on COVID-19 and how social media-based infodemics can result in mental health concerns. This paper discusses possible crisis communication solutions that media and news organizations can adopt to mitigate the negative influences of COVID-19 related news on mental health. Emphasizing the need for global media entities to forge a fact-based, person-centered, and collaborative response to COVID-19 reporting, this paper encourages media resources to focus on the core issue of how to slow or stop COVID-19 transmission effectively.",2021-01-05,2021,Zhaohui Su; Dean McDonnell; Jun Wen; Metin Kozak; Jaffar Abbas,Edith Cowan University,Globalization and Health,387,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00654-4,Cybersecurity,Misinformation; Mental health; Crisis communication; Public relations; Social media,0.267

In response, the Chinese government implemented the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) from 2013 to 2017 which had a significant impact on reducing PM 2.5 concentration. However, the health benefits of the APPCAP are not well understood. Here we examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of annual deaths attributable to PM 2.5 pollution (DAPP) in China and the contribution from the APPCAP using decomposition analysis. Despite a 36.1% increase in DAPP from 2000 to 2017, The APPCAP-induced improvement in air quality achieved substantial health benefits, with the DAPP in 2017 reduced by 64 thousand (6.8%) compared to 2013.

W4385632485,Practical and ethical challenges of large language models in education: A systematic scoping review,"Abstract Educational technology innovations leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential to automate the laborious process of generating and analysing textual content. While various innovations have been developed to automate a range of educational tasks (eg, question generation, feedback provision, and essay grading), there are concerns regarding the practicality and ethicality of these innovations. Such concerns may hinder future research and the adoption of LLMs‐based innovations in authentic educational contexts. To address this, we conducted a systematic scoping review of 118 peer‐reviewed papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using LLMs to automate and support educational tasks. The findings revealed 53 use cases for LLMs in automating education tasks, categorised into nine main categories: profiling/labelling, detection, grading, teaching support, prediction, knowledge representation, feedback, content generation, and recommendation. Additionally, we also identified several practical and ethical challenges, including low technological readiness, lack of replicability and transparency and insufficient privacy and beneficence considerations. The findings were summarised into three recommendations for future studies, including updating existing innovations with state‐of‐the‐art models (eg, GPT‐3/4), embracing the initiative of open‐sourcing models/systems, and adopting a human‐centred approach throughout the developmental process. As the intersection of AI and education is continuously evolving, the findings of this study can serve as an essential reference point for researchers, allowing them to leverage the strengths, learn from the limitations, and uncover potential research opportunities enabled by ChatGPT and other generative AI models. Practitioner notes What is currently known about this topic Generating and analysing text‐based content are time‐consuming and laborious tasks. Large language models are capable of efficiently analysing an unprecedented amount of textual content and completing complex natural language processing and generation tasks. Large language models have been increasingly used to develop educational technologies that aim to automate the generation and analysis of textual content, such as automated question generation and essay scoring. What this paper adds A comprehensive list of different educational tasks that could potentially benefit from LLMs‐based innovations through automation. A structured assessment of the practicality and ethicality of existing LLMs‐based innovations from seven important aspects using established frameworks. Three recommendations that could potentially support future studies to develop LLMs‐based innovations that are practical and ethical to implement in authentic educational contexts. Implications for practice and/or policy Updating existing innovations with state‐of‐the‐art models may further reduce the amount of manual effort required for adapting existing models to different educational tasks. The reporting standards of empirical research that aims to develop educational technologies using large language models need to be improved. Adopting a human‐centred approach throughout the developmental process could contribute to resolving the practical and ethical challenges of large language models in education.",2023-08-06,2023,Lixiang Yan; Lele Sha; Linxuan Zhao; Yuheng Li; Roberto Martínez‐Maldonado,Monash University,British Journal of Educational Technology,373,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13370,Cybersecurity,Computer science; Grading (engineering); Systematic review; Engineering ethics; Knowledge management,0.583

Specifically, we identify the research environments, dependent variables, themes representing the key findings, and critical future research directions. Background Whereas a burgeoning literature on high-performance teamwork identifies the factors critical to success, much less is known about how human–autonomy teams (HATs) achieve success. Human–autonomy teamwork involves humans working interdependently toward a common goal along with autonomous agents. Autonomous agents involve a degree of self-government and self-directed behavior (agency), and autonomous agents take on a unique role or set of tasks and work interdependently with human team members to achieve a shared objective. Method We searched the literature on human–autonomy teaming. To meet our criteria for inclusion, the paper needed to involve empirical research and meet our definition of human–autonomy teaming. We found 76 articles that met our criteria for inclusion. Results We report on research environments and we find that the key independent variables involve autonomous agent characteristics, team composition, task characteristics, human individual differences, training, and communication. We identify themes for each of these and discuss the future research needs.

Most notably, the platform is becoming more commercial and professionalized with the rise of TikTok Influencers, advertising networks, and agencies dedicated to monetizing content and embedding advertising on TikTok, and top TikTok Influencers raking in millions in income annually. However, little is known about the constitution of internet celebrity on TikTok yet, and existing models of internet celebrity on predecessor apps like Instagram and YouTube do not neatly apply to the distinctive terrain of TikTok. As such, this paper is an exploratory study into the makings of internet celebrity cultures on TikTok, focused on how attention economy and visibility labour practices have emerged as a result of the app’s features. With empirical data drawn from an extended period in-depth digital ethnography, and analyses and insights informed and supported by traditional anthropological participant observation and personal interviews with TikTok Influencers and agencies, this scoping paper offers a foundation for how celebrity, attention, and visibility are constituted across TikTok’s platform norms and features.",2020-01-01,2020,Crystal Abidin,Curtin University,Cultural Science Journal,366,https://doi.org/10.5334/csci.140,Cybersecurity,The Internet; Influencer marketing; Exploratory research; Empirical research; Surprise,0.225

W3186670456,The relationship between social support and mental health problems during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Background Pregnancy is a time of profound physical and emotional change as well as an increased risk of mental illness. While strengthening social support is a common recommendation to reduce such mental health risk, no systematic review or meta-analysis has yet examined the relationship between social support and mental problems during pregnancy. Methods The PRISMA checklist was used as a guide to systematically review relevant peer-reviewed literature reporting primary data analyses. PubMed, Psych Info, MIDIRS, SCOPUS, and CINAHL database searches were conducted to retrieve research articles published between the years 2000 to 2019. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale tool was used for quality appraisal and the meta-analysis was conducted using STATA. The Q and the I 2 statistics were used to evaluate heterogeneity. A random-effects model was used to pool estimates. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger’s regression test and adjusted using trim and Fill analysis. Result From the identified 3760 articles, 67 articles with 64,449 pregnant women were part of the current systematic review and meta-analysis. From the total 67 articles, 22 and 45 articles included in the narrative analysis and meta-analysis, respectively. From the total articles included in the narrative analysis, 20 articles reported a significant relationship between low social support and the risk of developing mental health problems (i.e. depression, anxiety, and self-harm) during pregnancy. After adjusting for publication bias, based on the results of the random-effect model, the pooled odds ratio (POR) of low social support was AOR: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.41) for studies examining the relationship between low social support and antenatal depression and AOR: 1.97 (95% CI: 1.34, 2.92) for studies examining the relationship between low social support and antenatal anxiety. Conclusion Low social support shows significant associations with the risk of depression, anxiety, and self-harm during pregnancy.

W3121901985,ENMTools 1.0: an R package for comparative ecological biogeography,"The ENMTools software package was introduced in 2008 as a platform for making measurements on environmental niche models (ENMs, frequently referred to as species distribution models or SDMs), and for using those measurements in the context of newly developed Monte Carlo tests to evaluate hypotheses regarding niche evolution. Additional functionality was later added for model selection and simulation from ENMs, and the software package has been quite widely used. ENMTools was initially implemented as a Perl script, which was also compiled into an executable file for various platforms. However, the package had a number of significant limitations; it was only designed to fit models using Maxent, it relied on a specific Perl distribution to function, and its internal structure made it difficult to maintain and expand. Subsequently, the R programming language became the platform of choice for most ENM studies, making ENMTools less usable for many practitioners. Here we introduce a new R version of ENMTools that implements much of the functionality of its predecessor as well as numerous additions that simplify the construction, comparison and evaluation of niche models. These additions include new metrics for model fit, methods of measuring ENM overlap, and methods for testing evolutionary hypotheses. The new version of ENMTools is also designed to work within the expanding universe of R tools for ecological biogeography, and as such includes greatly simplified interfaces for analyses from several other R packages.",2021-01-19,2021,Dan L.

We analyze how 12 forest attributes recover during secondary succession and how their recovery is interrelated using 77 sites across the tropics. Tropical forests are highly resilient to low-intensity land use; after 20 years, forest attributes attain 78% (33 to 100%) of their old-growth values. Recovery to 90% of old-growth values is fastest for soil (<1 decade) and plant functioning (<2.5 decades), intermediate for structure and species diversity (2.5 to 6 decades), and slowest for biomass and species composition (>12 decades). Network analysis shows three independent clusters of attribute recovery, related to structure, species diversity, and species composition. Secondary forests should be embraced as a low-cost, natural solution for ecosystem restoration, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation.",2021-12-09,2021,Lourens Poorter; Dylan Craven; Catarina C.

W4214622289,Opportunities and Adoption Challenges of AI in the Construction Industry: A PRISMA Review,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology with a range of capabilities, which are beginning to become apparent in all industries nowadays. The increased popularity of AI in the construction industry, however, is rather limited in comparison to other industry sectors. Moreover, despite AI being a hot topic in built environment research, there are limited review studies that investigate the reasons for the low-level AI adoption in the construction industry. This study aims to reduce this gap by identifying the adoption challenges of AI, along with the opportunities offered, for the construction industry. To achieve the aim, the study adopts a systematic literature review approach using the PRISMA protocol. In addition, the systematic review of the literature focuses on the planning, design, and construction stages of the construction project lifecycle. The results of the review reveal that (a) AI is particularly beneficial in the planning stage as the success of construction projects depends on accurate events, risks, and cost forecasting; (b) the major opportunity in adopting AI is to reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks by using big data analytics and improving the work processes; and (c) the biggest challenge to incorporate AI on a construction site is the fragmented nature of the industry, which has resulted in issues of data acquisition and retention. The findings of the study inform a range of parties that operate in the construction industry concerning the opportunities and challenges of AI adaptability and help increase the market acceptance of AI practices.",2022-03-01,2022,Massimo Regona; Tan Yiğitcanlar; Bo Xia; Rita Yi Man Li,Queensland University of Technology,Journal of Open Innovation Technology Market and Complexity,350,https://doi.org/10.3390/joitmc8010045,Cybersecurity,Popularity; Construction industry; Systematic review; Adaptability; Big data,0.225
W4289861094,Identifying industry 5.0 contributions to sustainable development: A strategy roadmap for delivering sustainability values,"Scholars believe that the newly introduced Industry 5.0 has the potential to move beyond the profit-centered productivity of Industry 4.0 and to promote sustainable development goals such as human-centricity, socio-environmental sustainability, and resilience. However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research, emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0.",2022-08-05,2022,Morteza Ghobakhloo; Mohammad Iranmanesh; Muhammad Faraz Mubarak; Mobashar Mubarik; Abderahman Rejeb,Edith Cowan University,Sustainable Production and Consumption,347,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2022.08.003,Cybersecurity,Sustainability; Sustainable development; Adaptability; Business; Industry 4.0,0.358
W3038187379,Mapping citizen science contributions to the UN sustainable development goals,"Abstract The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a vision for achieving a sustainable future. Reliable, timely, comprehensive, and consistent data are critical for measuring progress towards, and ultimately achieving, the SDGs. Data from citizen science represent one new source of data that could be used for SDG reporting and monitoring. However, information is still lacking regarding the current and potential contributions of citizen science to the SDG indicator framework. Through a systematic review of the metadata and work plans of the 244 SDG indicators, as well as the identification of past and ongoing citizen science initiatives that could directly or indirectly provide data for these indicators, this paper presents an overview of where citizen science is already contributing and could contribute data to the SDG indicator framework. The results demonstrate that citizen science is “already contributing” to the monitoring of 5 SDG indicators, and that citizen science “could contribute” to 76 indicators, which, together, equates to around 33%. Our analysis also shows that the greatest inputs from citizen science to the SDG framework relate to SDG 15 Life on Land, SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 3 Good Health and Wellbeing, and SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation. Realizing the full potential of citizen science requires demonstrating its value in the global data ecosystem, building partnerships around citizen science data to accelerate SDG progress, and leveraging investments to enhance its use and impact.",2020-07-02,2020,Dilek Fraisl; Jillian Campbell; Linda See; Uta Wehn; Joanna M.

W3082030567,The co-evolution of two Chinese mobile short video apps: Parallel platformization of Douyin and TikTok,"TikTok is the international twin of China’s mobile short video app, Douyin, and one of the fastest growing short video platforms in the world. Owned by Chinese tech giant, ByteDance, TikTok and Douyin share many similarities in terms of appearance, functionality, and platform affordances; however, they exist in radically different markets and are governed by radically different forces. Unlike other popular mobile media platforms in China and internationally, TikTok and Douyin are neither part of the big three tech giants in China nor the big five in the US. This provides an interesting case study to investigate how an emerging internet company adapts its products to better fit divergent expectations, cultures, and policy frameworks in China and abroad. Using the app walkthrough method informed by platformization of culture production theory, this study highlights the similarities and distinctions between these two platforms. We argue the co-evolution of Douyin and TikTok is a new paradigm of global platform expansion that differs from strategies of regionalization adopted by previous major social media platforms. We contribute to platformization theory by developing the concept of parallel platformization to explain ByteDance’s strategies for surviving in two opposing platform ecosystems in China and abroad.",2020-08-30,2020,D.

W3111662315,"Nanostructured Metal Sulfides: Classification, Modification Strategy, and Solar‐Driven CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction Application","Abstract Solar‐driven conversion of CO 2 into high value‐added fuels is expected to be an environmental‐friendly and sustainable approach for relieving the greenhouse gas effect and countering energy crisis. Metal sulfide semiconductors with wide photoresponsive range and favorable band structures are suitable photocatalysts for CO 2 photoreduction. This review summarizes the recent progress on metal sulfide semiconductors for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. First, the fundamentals, mechanisms and some principles, like product selectivity, of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction are introduced. Then, according to the elemental composition, the metal sulfide photocatalysts applied for CO 2 reduction are classified into binary (CdS, ZnS, MoS 2 , SnS 2 , Bi 2 S 3 , In 2 S 3 ,Cu 2 S, NiS/NiS 2 , and CoS 2 ), ternary (ZnIn 2 S 4 , CdIn 2 S 4 , CuInS 2 , Cu 3 SnS 4 , and CuGaS 2 ), and quaternary (Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 ) systems, in which their crystal structures, photochemical characteristics, and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction applications are systematically demonstrated. Especially, the diverse modification strategies for improving the activity and product selectivity of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction on these metal sulfides are summarized. Finally, the current challenges and future directions for the development of metal sulfide photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction are proposed. This review is expected to serve as a powerful reference for exploiting high‐efficiency metal sulfide photocatalysts for CO 2 conversion and furthering related mechanism understanding.",2020-12-04,2020,Jingjing Wang; Sen Lin; Na Tian; Tianyi Ma; Yihe Zhang,Swinburne University of Technology,Advanced Functional Materials,344,https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202008008,Cybersecurity,Photocatalysis; Sulfide; Materials science; Ternary operation; Zinc sulfide,0.3
W4387036470,2023 International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) consensus statement on Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (REDs),"Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (REDs) was first introduced in 2014 by the International Olympic Committee’s expert writing panel, identifying a syndrome of deleterious health and performance outcomes experienced by female and male athletes exposed to low energy availability (LEA; inadequate energy intake in relation to exercise energy expenditure). Since the 2018 REDs consensus, there have been &gt;170 original research publications advancing the field of REDs science, including emerging data demonstrating the growing role of low carbohydrate availability, further evidence of the interplay between mental health and REDs and more data elucidating the impact of LEA in males. Our knowledge of REDs signs and symptoms has resulted in updated Health and Performance Conceptual Models and the development of a novel Physiological Model. This Physiological Model is designed to demonstrate the complexity of either problematic or adaptable LEA exposure, coupled with individual moderating factors, leading to changes in health and performance outcomes. Guidelines for safe and effective body composition assessment to help prevent REDs are also outlined. A new REDs Clinical Assessment Tool-Version 2 is introduced to facilitate the detection and clinical diagnosis of REDs based on accumulated severity and risk stratification, with associated training and competition recommendations. Prevention and treatment principles of REDs are presented to encourage best practices for sports organisations and clinicians. Finally, methodological best practices for REDs research are outlined to stimulate future high-quality research to address important knowledge gaps.",2023-09-01,2023,Margo Mountjoy; Kathryn E.

W3210188060,Viewpoint: The case for a six-dimensional food security framework,"The definition of food security has evolved and changed over the past 50 years, including the introduction of the four commonly cited pillars of food security: availability, access, utilization, and stability, which have been important in shaping policy. In this article, we make the case that it is time for a formal update to our definition of food security to include two additional dimensions proposed by the High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition: agency and sustainability. We show that the impact of widening food system inequalities and growing awareness of the intricate connections between ecological systems and food systems highlight the importance of these additional dimensions to the concept. We further outline the ways in which international policy guidance on the right to food already implies both agency and sustainability alongside the more established four pillars, making it a logical next step to adopt a six dimensional framework for food security in both policy and scholarly settings. We also show that advances have already been made with respect to providing measurements of agency and sustainability as they relate to food insecurity.",2021-10-27,2021,Jennifer Clapp; William G.

W3013507497,Nurse resilience: A concept analysis,"Abstract Nurse resilience is attracting increasing attention in research and practice. Possession of a high level of resilience is cited as being crucial for nurses to succeed professionally and manage workplace stressors. There is no agreed definition of nurse resilience. A concept analysis was undertaken to examine nurse resilience using a priori selected analysis framework. This concept analysis aims to systematically analyse resilience as it relates to nurses and establish a working definition of nurse resilience. Sixty‐nine papers met the search criteria for inclusion. Key attributes of nurse resilience were social support, self‐efficacy, work–life balance/self‐care, humour, optimism, and being realistic. Resilience enables nurses to positively adapt to stressors and adversity. It is a complex and dynamic process which varies over time and context and embodies both individual attributes and external resources. Sustaining nurse resilience requires action and engagement from both individuals and organizations.",2020-03-29,2020,Alannah L. Cooper; Janie Brown; Clare S.

W3122328384,"Racism, Hate Speech, and Social Media: A Systematic Review and Critique","Departing from Jessie Daniels’s 2013 review of scholarship on race and racism online, this article maps and discusses recent developments in the study of racism and hate speech in the subfield of social media research. Systematically examining 104 articles, we address three research questions: Which geographical contexts, platforms, and methods do researchers engage with in studies of racism and hate speech on social media? To what extent does scholarship draw on critical race perspectives to interrogate how systemic racism is (re)produced on social media? What are the primary methodological and ethical challenges of the field? The article finds a lack of geographical and platform diversity, an absence of researchers’ reflexive dialogue with their object of study, and little engagement with critical race perspectives to unpack racism on social media.

W4283155707,Scientific evidence on the political impact of the Sustainable Development Goals,"Abstract In 2015, the United Nations agreed on 17 Sustainable Development Goals as the central normative framework for sustainable development worldwide. The effectiveness of governing by such broad global goals, however, remains uncertain, and we lack comprehensive meta-studies that assess the political impact of the goals across countries and globally. We present here condensed evidence from an analysis of over 3,000 scientific studies on the Sustainable Development Goals published between 2016 and April 2021. Our findings suggests that the goals have had some political impact on institutions and policies, from local to global governance. This impact has been largely discursive, affecting the way actors understand and communicate about sustainable development. More profound normative and institutional impact, from legislative action to changing resource allocation, remains rare. We conclude that the scientific evidence suggests only limited transformative political impact of the Sustainable Development Goals thus far.",2022-06-20,2022,Frank Biermann; Thomas Hickmann; Carole‐Anne Sénit; Marianne Beisheim; Steven Bernstein,Monash University,Nature Sustainability,336,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-022-00909-5,Cybersecurity,Sustainable development; Normative; Politics; Transformative learning; Political science,0.15
W3009850388,Global burden of antenatal depression and its association with adverse birth outcomes: an umbrella review,"Women of childbearing age are at high risk of developing depression and antenatal depression is one of the most common mood disorders. Antenatal depression is also associated with a number of poor maternal and infant outcomes, however, there remains a lack of focus on mental issues in antenatal care, particularly in lower income countries. This systematic review of reviews provides useful evidence regarding the burden of antenatal depression which may provide guidance for health policy development and planning.We searched CINAHL(EBSCO), MEDLINE (via Ovid), PsycINFO, Emcare, PubMed, Psychiatry Online, and Scopus databases for systematic reviews that based on observational studies that were published in between January 1st, 2007 and August 31st, 2018. We used the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist scores to assess the quality of the included reviews. We applied vote counting and narrative review to summarize the prevalence of antenatal depression and its associated factors, while statistical pooling was conducted for estimating the association of antenatal depression with low birth weight and preterm birth. This systematic review of reviews was registered on PROSPERO with protocol number CRD42018116267.We have included ten reviews (306 studies with 877,246 participants) on antenatal depression prevalence and six reviews (39 studies with 75,451 participants) conducted to identify the effect of antenatal depression on preterm and low birth weight. Globally, we found that antenatal depression prevalence ranged from 15 to 65%. We identified the following prominent risk factors based on their degree of influence: Current or previous exposure to different forms of abuse and violence (six reviews and 73 studies); lack of social and/or partner support (four reviews and 47 studies); personal or family history of any common mental disorder (three reviews and 34 studies). The risk of low birth weight and preterm birth was 1.49 (95%CI: 1.32, 1.68; I2 = 0.0%) and 1.40 (95%CI: 1.16, 1.69; I2 = 35.2%) times higher among infants born from depressed mothers.Globally, antenatal depression prevalence was high and could be considered a common mental disorder during pregnancy. Though the association between antenatal depression and adverse birth outcomes appeared to be modest, its absolute impact would be significant in lower-income countries with a high prevalence of antenatal depression and poor access to quality mental health services.",2020-02-04,2020,Abel Fekadu Dadi; Emma R.

W4280592757,High-resolution mapping of losses and gains of Earth’s tidal wetlands,"Tidal wetlands are expected to respond dynamically to global environmental change, but the extent to which wetland losses have been offset by gains remains poorly understood. We developed a global analysis of satellite data to simultaneously monitor change in three highly interconnected intertidal ecosystem types-tidal flats, tidal marshes, and mangroves-from 1999 to 2019. Globally, 13,700 square kilometers of tidal wetlands have been lost, but these have been substantially offset by gains of 9700 km2, leading to a net change of -4000 km2 over two decades. We found that 27% of these losses and gains were associated with direct human activities such as conversion to agriculture and restoration of lost wetlands. All other changes were attributed to indirect drivers, including the effects of coastal processes and climate change.",2022-05-12,2022,Nicholas Murray; Thomas A.

Board gender diversity and environmental innovation,"Abstract As a result of recent climate change impacts, environmental sustainability has received enormous attention from scholars and policy makers. Environmental innovation is one of the major ways of acting in harmony with the environment, but it also requires a significant amount of resources and strong corporate commitment. As boards of directors have great influence over the strategic direction of firms and are responsible for corporate environmentalism, we examine the likely relationship between board gender diversity (BGD) and environmental innovation measured as process innovation and product innovation. Based on a relatively large dataset (10,334 firm‐year observations) of U.S. listed firms, we find that BGD has a significant positive association with environmental innovation. Furthermore, we also find that this relationship is more pronounced in less profitable firms and in environmentally sensitive industries. Our results remain robust to endogeneity issues and alternative proxies. We interpret our results under upper echelon and gender socialization theories and suggest important implications for policy makers.",2020-06-29,2020,Muhammad Nadeem; Stephen Bahadar; Ammar Ali Gull; Umer Iqbal,University of Otago,Business Strategy and the Environment,330,https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.2563,Cybersecurity,Gender diversity; Business; Diversity (politics); Endogeneity; Harmony (color),0.283
W3003331254,The Internet of Landlords: Digital Platforms and New Mechanisms of Rentier Capitalism,"Abstract Digital platforms are a nearly ubiquitous form of intermediary and infrastructure in society. By positioning platforms in the geographical political economy/ecology literature, this paper provides a critical analysis of platforms as a dominant form of rentier in contemporary capitalism. In doing so, I extend this work on rent theory beyond applications to land and nature so that it also includes platforms and data. I argue that the rapid rise of the “X‐as‐a‐service” business model across nearly all sectors of the economy is creating rentier relations by another name. This model is premised on the platform latching onto and inserting itself into the production, circulation, or consumption process, thus creating opportunities to capture value. To better understand the operations and implications of platforms, I outline three key mechanisms: data extraction, digital enclosure, and capital convergence.",2020-02-03,2020,Jathan Sadowski,Monash University,Antipode,328,https://doi.org/10.1111/anti.12595,Cybersecurity,Capitalism; Digital economy; Consumption (sociology); The Internet; Capital (architecture),0.433

As the online teaching of English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) in Chinese universities is facing new challenges, EFL teachers have been positively exploring new solutions. To understand how EFL teachers were coping with the challenges, we set up this research as part of a larger study to examine EFL teachers' cognitions about online teaching in response to the disruption of normal teaching plans. We did so by taking a qualitative approach through analyzing in-depth interviews with three EFL teachers from a Chinese university. Through thematic analysis we found that teachers had clear cognitions about features, advantages, and constraints of online EFL teaching and that they acquired information and communication technology (ICT) literacy through understanding students' learning needs, online teaching practice, and the necessity of integrating traditional classroom teaching methods into online delivery.

W4289204800,Global Mangrove Extent Change 1996–2020: Global Mangrove Watch Version 3.0,"Mangroves are a globally important ecosystem that provides a wide range of ecosystem system services, such as carbon capture and storage, coastal protection and fisheries enhancement. Mangroves have significantly reduced in global extent over the last 50 years, primarily as a result of deforestation caused by the expansion of agriculture and aquaculture in coastal environments. However, a limited number of studies have attempted to estimate changes in global mangrove extent, particularly into the 1990s, despite much of the loss in mangrove extent occurring pre-2000. This study has used L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) global mosaic datasets from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for 11 epochs from 1996 to 2020 to develop a long-term time-series of global mangrove extent and change. The study used a map-to-image approach to change detection where the baseline map (GMW v2.5) was updated using thresholding and a contextual mangrove change mask. This approach was applied between all image-date pairs producing 10 maps for each epoch, which were summarised to produce the global mangrove time-series. The resulting mangrove extent maps had an estimated accuracy of 87.4% (95th conf. int.: 86.2–88.6%), although the accuracies of the individual gain and loss change classes were lower at 58.1% (52.4–63.9%) and 60.6% (56.1–64.8%), respectively. Sources of error included misregistration in the SAR mosaic datasets, which could only be partially corrected for, but also confusion in fragmented areas of mangroves, such as around aquaculture ponds. Overall, 152,604 km2 (133,996–176,910) of mangroves were identified for 1996, with this decreasing by −5245 km2 (−13,587–1444) resulting in a total extent of 147,359 km2 (127,925–168,895) in 2020, and representing an estimated loss of 3.4% over the 24-year time period.

W3184396411,Automatic feedback in online learning environments: A systematic literature review,"Feedback is an essential component of scaffolding for learning. Feedback provides insights into the assistance of learners in terms of achieving learning goals and improving self-regulated skills. In online courses, feedback becomes even more critical since instructors and students are separated geographically and physically. In this context, feedback allows the instructor to customize learning content according to the students' needs. However, giving feedback is a challenging task for instructors, especially in contexts of large cohorts. As a result, several automatic feedback systems have been proposed to reduce the workload on the part of the instructor. Although these systems have started gaining research attention, there have been limited studies that systematically analyze the progress achieved so far as reported in the literature. Thus, this article presents a systematic literature review on automatic feedback generation in learning management systems. The main findings of this review are: (1) 65.07% of the studies demonstrate that automatic feedback increases student performance in activities; (2) 46.03% of the studies demonstrated that there is no evidence that automatic feedback eases instructors’ workload; (3) 82.53% of the studies showed that there is no evidence that manual feedback is more efficient than automatic feedback; and (4) the main method used for automatic feedback provision is the comparison with a desired answer in some subject (such as logic circuits or programming).",2021-01-01,2021,Anderson Pinheiro Cavalcanti; Arthur Barbosa; Ruan Carvalho; Fred Freitas; Yi‐Shan Tsai,Monash University,Computers and Education Artificial Intelligence,313,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100027,Cybersecurity,Workload; Computer science; Context (archaeology); Task (project management); Systematic review,0.15
W3164272096,Urinary extracellular vesicles: A position paper by the Urine Task Force of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles,"Abstract Urine is commonly used for clinical diagnosis and biomedical research. The discovery of extracellular vesicles (EV) in urine opened a new fast‐growing scientific field. In the last decade urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) were shown to mirror molecular processes as well as physiological and pathological conditions in kidney, urothelial and prostate tissue. Therefore, several methods to isolate and characterize uEVs have been developed. However, methodological aspects of EV separation and analysis, including normalization of results, need further optimization and standardization to foster scientific advances in uEV research and a subsequent successful translation into clinical practice. This position paper is written by the Urine Task Force of the Rigor and Standardization Subcommittee of ISEV consisting of nephrologists, urologists, cardiologists and biologists with active experience in uEV research. Our aim is to present the state of the art and identify challenges and gaps in current uEV‐based analyses for clinical applications. Finally, recommendations for improved rigor, reproducibility and interoperability in uEV research are provided in order to facilitate advances in the field.",2021-05-01,2021,Uta Erdbrügger; Charles J.

W2982395087,Does board gender diversity affect renewable energy consumption?,"This paper examines the effect of board gender diversity on renewable energy consumption. Using a panel of 11,677 firm-year observations from the USA for 2008–2016, we find a positive relationship between board gender diversity and renewable energy consumption. Moreover, boards require two or more women for women to have a significant impact on renewable energy consumption, consistent with the critical mass theory. Further, we document that the positive impact of female directors on renewable energy consumption stems from female independent rather than female executive directors. Finally, we find a positive effect of the interaction between renewable energy consumption and board gender diversity on firm financial performance. Our findings are robust to different identification strategies and estimation techniques.",2020-06-05,2020,Muhammad Atif; Mohammed Hossain; Md Samsul Alam; Marc Goergen,Macquarie University,Journal of Corporate Finance,309,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2020.101665,Cybersecurity,Renewable energy; Gender diversity; Diversity (politics); Affect (linguistics); Consumption (sociology),0.225
W3005982773,Screening and assessment tools for gaming disorder: A comprehensive systematic review,"The inclusion of gaming disorder (GD) as an official diagnosis in the ICD-11 was a significant milestone for the field. However, the optimal measurement approaches for GD are currently unclear. This comprehensive systematic review aimed to identify and evaluate all available English-language GD tools and their corresponding evidence. A search of PsychINFO, PsychArticles, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar identified 32 tools employed in 320 studies (N = 462,249 participants). The evaluation framework examined tools in relation to: (1) conceptual and practical considerations; (2) alignment with DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria; (3) type and quantity of studies and samples; and (4) psychometric properties. The evaluation showed that GD instrumentation has proliferated, with 2.5 tools, on average, published annually since 2013. Coverage of DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria was inconsistent, especially for the criterion of continued use despite harm. Tools converge on the importance of screening for impaired control over gaming and functional impairment. Overall, no single tool was found to be clearly superior, but the AICA-Sgaming, GAS-7, IGDT-10, IGDS9-SF, and Lemmens IGD-9 scales had greater evidential support for their psychometric properties. The GD field would benefit from a standard international tool to identify gaming-related harms across the spectrum of maladaptive gaming behaviors.",2020-02-10,2020,Daniel L. King; Samuel R.

W3020786514,Global trends in mangrove forest fragmentation,"Abstract Fragmentation is a major driver of ecosystem degradation, reducing the capacity of habitats to provide many important ecosystem services. Mangrove ecosystem services, such as erosion prevention, shoreline protection and mitigation of climate change (through carbon sequestration), depend on the size and arrangement of forest patches, but we know little about broad-scale patterns of mangrove forest fragmentation. Here we conduct a multi-scale analysis using global estimates of mangrove density and regional drivers of mangrove deforestation to map relationships between habitat loss and fragmentation. Mangrove fragmentation was ubiquitous; however, there are geographic disparities between mangrove loss and fragmentation; some regions, like Cambodia and the southern Caribbean, had relatively little loss, but their forests have been extensively fragmented. In Southeast Asia, a global hotspot of mangrove loss, the conversion of forests to aquaculture and rice plantations were the biggest drivers of loss (&gt;50%) and fragmentation. Surprisingly, conversion of forests to oil palm plantations, responsible for &gt;15% of all deforestation in Southeast Asia, was only weakly correlated with mangrove fragmentation. Thus, the management of different deforestation drivers may increase or decrease fragmentation. Our findings suggest that large scale monitoring of mangrove forests should also consider fragmentation. This work highlights that regional priorities for conservation based on forest loss rates can overlook fragmentation and associated loss of ecosystem functionality.",2020-04-28,2020,Dale Bryan‐Brown; Rod M.

W3042888165,Security and privacy in 6G networks: New areas and new challenges,"With the deployment of more and more 5g networks, the limitations of 5g networks have been found, which undoubtedly promotes the exploratory research of 6G networks as the next generation solutions. These investigations include the fundamental security and privacy problems associated with 6G technologies. Therefore, in order to consolidate and solidify this foundational research as a basis for future investigations, we have prepared a survey on the status quo of 6G security and privacy. The survey begins with a historical review of previous networking technologies and how they have informed the current trends in 6G networking. We then discuss four key aspects of 6G networks – real-time intelligent edge computing, distributed artificial intelligence, intelligent radio, and 3D intercoms – and some promising emerging technologies in each area, along with the relevant security and privacy issues. The survey concludes with a report on the potential use of 6G.

W4321790088,"Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA): Time-dependent Convection, Energy Conservation, Automatic Differentiation, and Infrastructure","We update the capabilities of the open-knowledge software instrument Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). The new auto_diff module implements automatic differentiation in MESA, an enabling capability that alleviates the need for hard-coded analytic expressions or finite difference approximations. We significantly enhance the treatment of the growth and decay of convection in MESA with a new model for time-dependent convection, which is particularly important during late-stage nuclear burning in massive stars and electron degenerate ignition events. We strengthen MESA's implementation of the equation of state, and we quantify continued improvements to energy accounting and solver accuracy through a discussion of different energy equation features and enhancements. To improve the modeling of stars in MESA we describe key updates to the treatment of stellar atmospheres, molecular opacities, Compton opacities, conductive opacities, element diffusion coefficients, and nuclear reaction rates. We introduce treatments of starspots, an important consideration for low-mass stars, and modifications for superadiabatic convection in radiation-dominated regions. We describe new approaches for increasing the efficiency of calculating monochromatic opacities and radiative levitation, and for increasing the efficiency of evolving the late stages of massive stars with a new operator split nuclear burning mode. We close by discussing major updates to MESA's software infrastructure that enhance source code development and community engagement.",2023-02-23,2023,Adam S. Jermyn; Evan B. Bauer; Josiah Schwab; R.

Transparent, accurate and comprehensive systematic review reporting helps researchers replicate methods, readers understand what was done and why, and clinicians and policy-makers implement results in practice. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement and its accompanying Explanation and Elaboration document provide general reporting examples for systematic reviews of healthcare interventions. However, implementation guidance for sport and exercise medicine, musculoskeletal rehabilitation, and sports science does not exist.

Indigenous peoples' concepts about what constitutes sustainability, for example, differ markedly from dominant sustainability discourses. The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystems Services (IPBES) is promoting dialogue across different knowledge systems globally. In 2017, member states of IPBES adopted an ILK Approach including: procedures for assessments of nature and nature's linkages with people; a participatory mechanism; and institutional arrangements for including indigenous peoples and local communities. We present this Approach and analyse how it supports ILK in IPBES assessments through: respecting rights; supporting care and mutuality; strengthening communities and their knowledge systems; and supporting knowledge exchange.

This article summarizes previous studies on IoT applications in healthcare. A comprehensive review and a bibliometric analysis were performed to objectively summarize the growth of IoT research in healthcare. To begin, 2,990 journal articles were carefully selected for further investigation. These publications were analyzed based on various bibliometric metrics, including publication year, journals, authors, institutions, and countries. Keyword co-occurrence and co-citation networks were generated to unravel significant research hotspots. The findings show that IoT research has received considerable interest from the healthcare community. Based on the results of the keyword co-occurrence network, IoT healthcare applications, blockchain applications, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, 5G telecommunications, as well as data analytics and computing technologies emerged as important topics. The co-citation network analysis reveals other important themes, including authentication schemes, fog computing, cloud-IoT integration, and cognitive smart healthcare.

W3010225030,Edge‐Rich Fe−N<sub>4</sub> Active Sites in Defective Carbon for Oxygen Reduction Catalysis,"Abstract Controllably constructing nitrogen‐modified divacancies (ND) in carbon substrates to immobilize atomic Fe species and unveiling the advantageous configuration is still challenging, but indispensable for attaining optimal Fe−N−C catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a fundamental investigation of unfolding intrinsically superior edge‐ND trapped atomic Fe motifs (e‐ND−Fe) relative to an intact center model (c‐ND−Fe) in ORR electrocatalysis is reported. Density functional theory calculations reveal that local electronic redistribution and bandgap shrinkage for e‐ND−Fe endow it with a lower free‐energy barrier toward direct four‐electron ORR. Inspired by this, a series of atomic Fe catalysts with adjustable ND−Fe coordination are synthesized, which verify that ORR performance highly depends on the concentration of e‐ND−Fe species. Remarkably, the best e‐ND−Fe catalyst delivers a favorable kinetic current density and halfwave potential that can be comparable to benchmark Pt−C under acidic conditions. This work will guide to develop highly active atomic metal catalysts through rational defect engineering.",2020-03-05,2020,Xin Wang; Yi Jia; Xin Mao; Daobin Liu; Wenxiang He,Griffith University,Advanced Materials,289,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202000966,Cybersecurity,Catalysis; Materials science; Redistribution (election); Oxygen reduction reaction; Carbon fibers,0.375

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to significant health burden in infected patients especially in those with underlying comorbidities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between comorbidities and their role in the exacerbation of disease in COVID-19 patients leading to fatal outcomes. A systematic review was conducted using data from MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases published from 1 December 2019 to 15 September 2020. Fifty-three articles were included in the systematic review. Of those 53 articles, 8 articles were eligible for meta-analysis. Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus were identified to be the most prevalent comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Our meta-analysis showed that cancer, chronic kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were independently associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Chronic kidney disease was statistically the most prominent comorbidity leading to death.

W3129366383,AMEE Consensus Statement: Planetary health and education for sustainable healthcare,"The purpose of this Consensus Statement is to provide a global, collaborative, representative and inclusive vision for educating an interprofessional healthcare workforce that can deliver sustainable healthcare and promote planetary health. It is intended to inform national and global accreditation standards, planning and action at the institutional level as well as highlight the role of individuals in transforming health professions education. Many countries have agreed to 'rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes' to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% within 10 years and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, including in healthcare. Currently, however, health professions graduates are not prepared for their roles in achieving these changes. Thus, to reduce emissions and meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), health professions education must equip undergraduates, and those already qualified, with the knowledge, skills, values, competence and confidence they need to sustainably promote the health, human rights and well-being of current and future generations, while protecting the health of the planet.The current imperative for action on environmental issues such as climate change requires health professionals to mobilize politically as they have before, becoming strong advocates for major environmental, social and economic change. A truly ethical relationship with people and the planet that we inhabit so precariously, and to guarantee a future for the generations which follow, demands nothing less of all health professionals.This Consensus Statement outlines the changes required in health professions education, approaches to achieve these changes and a timeline for action linked to the internationally agreed SDGs. It represents the collective vision of health professionals, educators and students from various health professions, geographic locations and cultures. 'Consensus' implies broad agreement amongst all individuals engaged in discussion on a specific issue, which in this instance, is agreement by all signatories of this Statement developed under the auspices of the Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE).To ensure a shared understanding and to accurately convey information, we outline key terms in a glossary which accompanies this Consensus Statement (Supplementary Appendix 1). We acknowledge, however, that terms evolve and that different terms resonate variably depending on factors such as setting and audience. We define education for sustainable healthcare as the process of equipping current and future health professionals with the knowledge, values, confidence and capacity to provide environmentally sustainable services through health professions education. We define a health professional as a person who has gained a professional qualification for work in the health system, whether in healthcare delivery, public health or a management or supporting role and education as 'the system comprising structures, curricula, faculty and activities contributing to a learning process'.

W3024632559,COVID‐19 and Indigenous Peoples: An imperative for action,"We acknowledge the traditional custodians of Country across the world, and their continuing relationship to culture, community, land, waters and sky. We honour children born and yet to be, and pay our respects to Elders, past, present and future. Every person on Earth has been affected in some way by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However, there is a marked inequity in the impact and threat of the disease for the 370 million Indigenous Peoples worldwide. While honouring diversity in Peoples and cultures, this editorial (written by a collaborative of Indigenous nurses from Australia, Aotearoa (New Zealand), Canada, the United States of America and Central America) explores contemporary issues raised for Indigenous communities by this latest public health emergency. Please note, while we may describe a situation about a specific Indigenous group, readers can be assured that the issues we raise are endemic across colonised Indigenous communities globally. During pandemics, Indigenous Peoples suffer higher infection rates, and more severe symptoms and death than the general population because of the powerful forces of the social and cultural determinants of health and lack of political power. During the 1918 Spanish Influenza pandemic, Māori died at a rate of seven times that of the European population, which is likely an underestimation because of undocumented Māori deaths (Summers, Baker, & Wilson, 2018). First Nations people in Canada were eight times more likely to die compared with non-First Nations (Kelm, 1999). Although COVID-19 infection rates are currently low, in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, Aboriginal people in central Australia experienced rates five times higher than the nonindigenous population (Mousseau, 2013). Pacific Island and Māori people were seven times more likely to be hospitalised than Europeans and three and a half times more likely to die (Mousseau, 2013). Mortality for American Indian and Alaska Natives from H1N1 was four times higher than people from all other ethnicities combined (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2009). In Canada, First Nations people were three times more likely to be hospitalised, and six and a half times more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit (Boggild, Yuan, Low, & McGeer, 2011). Indigenous Peoples experience a more significant burden of noncommunicable and infectious diseases generally, and this is related to social and health inequities stemming from invasion and subsequent colonisation. Colonisation's legacy for Indigenous Peoples includes intergenerational and concentrated poverty, poor physical and mental health, transport and housing issues, increased rates of domestic and family violence, shorter life expectancy and inadequate access to culturally safe care (Allan & Smylie, 2015; Braveman et al., 2011). Colonisation is known to have a negative effect on the social determinants of health (Greenwood, de Leeuw, & Lindsay, 2018; Sherwood, 2018) and cultural determinants of health (Salmon et al., 2019). In Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Americas, invasion and subsequent colonisation have brought about disproportionate inequities that detrimentally affect Indigenous Peoples compared with other groups in their respective countries. Indigenous Peoples in colonised nations share similar histories of invasion, displacement from traditional lands and relocation onto missions or reservations, stolen generations, forced assimilation, genocide, decimation from introduced infectious diseases and the attempted erasure of culture through the banning of languages and cultural practices (Sherwood, 2018). In Central American countries like Guatemala and Panama, Indigenous Peoples have endured centuries of war, internal violence, exile, marginalisation, genocide and other trauma. The existence of imposed trauma and decimation began when Spaniards invaded Panama in the early 16th century (Central Intelligence Agency, 2020). Despite the world class, universal healthcare systems available in Canada and Australia, Indigenous populations continue to experience much poorer health outcomes due to the legacies and intersections of colonialism and racism (Allan & Smylie, 2015). Indigenous People's increased vulnerability to disease is unquestionable, evident not only in shorter life expectancies but also in the lower age we become more vulnerable. In Australia, the Health Department advice is for Australians aged 70 years or over, or those aged 65 years or over with chronic medical conditions to stay at home and avoid all contact with other people. However, for Indigenous Peoples, this recommendation is for those aged over 50 years (Department of Health, 2020b). Regretfully, while they do highlight the danger of comorbidities, several of our governments have neglected to explicitly recognise the premature mortality of Indigenous Peoples in their advice about vulnerability to COVID-19 (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2020; New Zealand Government, 2020b; Public Health Agency of Canada, 2020). Historical data have demonstrated that poor health and poverty positively correlate with pandemic severity (Clay, Lewis, & Severnini, 2019). Poverty impacts Indigenous Peoples' capacity to respond to COVID-19 on multiple levels. In this current crisis, health outcomes are determined by levels of secure housing, employment, comorbidities, functional literacy, health insurance, food security, access to running water, access to health care and technology. A one-size-fits-all response to COVID-19 ignores the roles of privilege, affluence and racism in perpetuating inequities, and therefore the ability to provide culturally safe care (Best, 2018). Globally, many Indigenous Peoples live on missions and reserves. Many of these missions and reserves are geographically rural or remote. Among the 574 tribes in the USA, the Navajo Nation is the third highest population in the nation for per capita infections after New York and New Jersey. As of 22nd May 2020, the Navajo Nation had over 4,253 positive cases and 146 deaths from COVID-19 (Navajo Department of Health, 2020a). Older age, multigenerational housing, lack of running water, communal wells, increased chronic disease and poverty have increased the impact of COVID-19. Forty per cent of Navajo households do not have access to running water, and thirty per cent do not have electricity (DigDeep & US Water Alliance, 2020). Lack of access to running water makes it difficult to comply with handwashing recommendations. Additionally, many Native American tribes, such as the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, are not eligible to receive federal funds to provide health care (Maynor Lowery, 2009, 2018). The marginalisation, segregation and discrimination of these tribes are negatively impacting their health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 situation. These tribes are relying upon their own resources to address their tribal community needs. Likewise, in Central America, many Indigenous groups live in low- or middle-income countries lacking fundamental basic human needs such as clean water and environment to live in, resulting in higher rates of infectious disease such as COVID-19 (Babyar, 2019). To help curb the spread of COVID-19, the Navajo Department of Health ordered all members within their 17-million-acre reservation/jurisdiction, over the age of 2 years to wear masks in public and have instituted isolation measures including weekend curfews. Unnecessary travel is punishable by up to 30 days incarceration or a $1,000 (USD) fine (Navajo Department of Health, 2020b). Similar lockdowns are evident across the globe. In Australia, enactment of the Biosecurity Act 2015 has given the Federal Minister of Health extraordinary powers (Maclean & Elphick, 2020). On the 26th March 2020, the Minister invoked biosecurity travel restrictions for remote areas. People wishing to enter remote communities must self-isolate for 14 days prior to entry (National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA), 2020). Assurances that ""Governments will support people who do not have appropriate alternate arrangements to self-isolate"" are not trusted (NIAA, 2020). Some communities are hundreds of kilometres and many hours away from regional centres, and where people would be accommodated is not clear. Furthermore, this support has not been evident for other Aboriginal people, with media reports of rough sleepers having camps broken up by police, and possessions thrown into garbage trucks (Hirini, 2020). A central tension exists between food security and affordability and the closing of missions, reservations, and communities to keep Indigenous Peoples safe from the virus. Prepandemic, one in three adult Aboriginal people who lived remotely in Australia reported running out of food and being unable to afford more (Rogers, Ferguson, Ritchie, Van Den Boogaard, & Brimblecombe, 2018). In many remote communities, there is only one store to buy food from, and prices are exorbitant due to transport and access issues (Rogers et al., 2018). In some cases, price-gouging is evident (Central Land Council, 2020). Because of food costing up to sixty per cent more in remote communities, many Aboriginal people prefer to travel to regional towns to do their shopping (Central Land Council, 2020). With biosecurity lockdowns in effect, this is no longer possible. COVID-19 exacerbates food insecurity by unexpected increases in unemployment, halts in tourism and people being unable to leave their communities to hunt and participate in cultural determinants of health. This also demonstrates one of the unique differences globally among Indigenous populations in locking down communities. Within Australia, Indigenous Peoples have a history of being confined to designated areas called missions and reserves. This was government policy from approximately the 1890s to 1970s (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), 2019). In other global Indigenous populations, locking down has been a self-determined process. Within Australia, the question of triggering episodes of post-traumatic stress has arisen for those older Indigenous Peoples who still live on the missions and reserves. Being locked down again due to government intervention and legislation as they were up until the early 1970s in the state of Queensland is still in the lived experiences of a number of Indigenous Australians. Characteristics of crises like pandemics include a rapid increase in rape, sexual assault and violence (Peterman et al., 2020). Indigenous people worldwide are already at increased risk of family violence, a consequence of colonisation and historical trauma, (Wilson, Mikahere-Hall, Sherwood, Cootes, & Jackson, 2019), with ""prevalence rates of 57% and 80% found for lifetime violence among wāhine Māori"" (women; Wilson et al., 2019, p. 15). ""Aboriginal women [in Australia] are 32 times more likely to be hospitalised for family violence as non-Aboriginal women"" (Andrews, 2020, para. 3). In Canada, First Nations, Inuit and Métis women are two and half times more likely to experience violence than nonindigenous women (Klingspohn, 2018). In the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (NIMMIWG) (2019) in Canada, the sexual and physical abuse and murder of Indigenous women and girls that have been ongoing for generations have been labelled genocide. Native American women sustain rates of violent victimisation (rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault and simple assault) at rates that are two times higher than African Americans, two and a half times that of Hispanics, two and a half times that of Caucasians, and four times that of Asians (Morgan & Oudekerk, 2019). The current COVID-19 crisis has seen ""reports from Australia, Brazil, China and the United States suggesting a sudden rise in violence against women and children"" (Peterman et al., 2020, p. 3). Compounding the sudden increase in violence during a pandemic is the intersecting forms of stressors stemming from a sudden rise in economic, emotional and physical pressures; enforced proximity from lockdowns; and, reduced access to support systems, health care and first responders (Peterman et al., 2020). Pre-existing trauma and stress are triggered during disasters, so there will also be a corresponding rise in harmful alcohol and substance abuse (Macauley, 2020). Families faced with the stressors associated with COVID-19 may see violence occurring for the first time. These factors all culminate in Indigenous women and children affected by violence, no longer being able to enact the strategies they could take to keep themselves and their children safe. It will also be very difficult to seek help outside of their homes. The COVID-19 crisis has seen unprecedented disruption to cultural practices and the normal relational and collective practices of Indigenous Peoples. This is detrimental as it has been empirically proven that the cultural determinants of health have an overwhelmingly positive impact on the health of Indigenous Peoples (Bourke et al., 2018). Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia travel frequently between communities to attend to Sorry Business (funerals and grieving; Department of Health, 2020a). In the current environment of lockdowns and social distancing, Indigenous people are having difficulties reconciling coronavirus restrictions with their relationally based cultural obligations, with mourning taking precedence (Wainwright, 2020). Māori in Aotearoa have also been forced to reconsider how they undertake the cultural practices involved to farewell someone who passed away and how they support older people and those with high needs. Traditional greetings of hongi (pressing noses when greeting) and harirū (shaking hands) have a rāhui (temporary prohibition) suspending such practices that breach social distancing regulations (New Zealand Government, 2020a). Prepandemic, governments were already failing in their efforts to reduce the inequities in social determinants and health outcomes between Indigenous and nonindigenous citizens, and Indigenous Peoples are generally under-resourced for responding to the current crisis. A 2019 report on health security across 195 countries found that the majority of countries were ill-equipped to prevent, detect and respond to health emergencies (Nalabandian et al., 2019). For instance, it is estimated that there are only 100 ventilators available from Guatemala to Haiti (Burki, 2020). Furthermore, algorithms triaging access to intensive care facilities are likely to exclude Indigenous Peoples because of the co-morbid conditions they may have. Indigenous Peoples are known to survive historical and contemporary adversities, demonstrating resourcefulness and resilience in adversity. Despite the marginalisation of Indigenous Peoples in countries' COVID-19 responses, Indigenous communities are instituting their own measures in the presence of universal approaches to managing not only the spread of COVID-19 but in addressing the needs borne out of poverty, housing and food insecurity. In Aotearoa, Iwi (tribal nations) are distributing food parcels to older people who cannot leave their homes and whanau (Family) rather than expecting people to make their way to a food bank. In some more remote areas, Iwi are monitoring who comes and goes out of their rohe (Iwi region) with roadblocks. In Canada, First Nation populations are gathering their bundles for medicine, food, birthing and death, while developing innovative ways to protect themselves such as making their own protective facemasks (Wright, 2020). Although we and some allied media are reporting on these initiatives, information on strategies Indigenous Peoples have implemented during pandemics is not routinely collected or acknowledged (Zavaleta, 2020). To this date, despite known vulnerability and high mortality rates, little information related to the rates of COVID-19 in Indigenous Peoples is obtainable. Even where testing is available, data are rarely disaggregated by ethnicity (United Nations, 2020). Yet data will be essential to understand the true impact of COVID-19 on our communities, justify the demand for resources like food and personal protection equipment (PPE) and allow service access and delivery to ensure already existing inequities do not worsen further (Phelan, 2020). Indigenous communities across Canada are urging provincial and federal health leaders to disclose COVID statistics to their nations, reporting that these numbers will help nations prepare and respond appropriately to potential outbreaks. In Central America, statistical transparency among Indigenous groups related to previous pandemics and other health outcomes is lacking, further perpetuating the lack of Indigenous voice and increasing the health disparity gap (Babyar, 2019). Failure to recognise the differences in morbidity and mortality among Indigenous Peoples contributes to inequities. There is not only a lack of information sharing but the delay in funding to support nations, and the growing jurisdictional disputes over who will provide these services has once again been intensified in the response to COVID pandemic planning. If ever there was a time to acknowledge the need to collect accurate ethnicity data and disseminate adequate resources to address health disparities among Indigenous people globally, now is that time. The needs of Indigenous Peoples must be made visible and not subsumed instead, in generalised universal response strategies. In this editorial, we have drawn attention to the existing health and social justice inequities stemming from colonisation. We have discussed the devastating effects pandemics have on our health and capacity to practice culture which is our medicine. We have asked the reader to consider the desperate situation our Peoples face, but recognise the Indigenous-led solutions that are being enacted. We demand our governments recognise that the harm and hurt and drastically increased morbidity and mortality in our communities during this pandemic are their legacies of failing to address historical and ongoing inequities. The cultural determinants of health must be recognised as the remedy and be built into health policy, practice and research. Going forward, data need to meticulously document the damage, naming us by our countries, our communities, our clans and our tribes. So that the next time disease sweeps our planet, we know our weaknesses, we know our strengths, and if more informed and empowered, we will prevail against the next neo colonial wave.",2020-05-16,2020,Tamara Power; Denise Wilson; Odette Best; Teresa Brockie; Lisa Bourque Bearskin,University of Technology Sydney,Journal of Clinical Nursing,272,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15320,Cybersecurity,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Indigenous; 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak; Action (physics); Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),0.85
W4319022775,Exercise as medicine for depressive symptoms? A systematic review and meta-analysis with meta-regression,"Objective To estimate the efficacy of exercise on depressive symptoms compared with non-active control groups and to determine the moderating effects of exercise on depression and the presence of publication bias. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis with meta-regression. Data sources The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science were searched without language restrictions from inception to 13 September2022 (PROSPERO registration no CRD42020210651). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials including participants aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder or those with depressive symptoms determined by validated screening measures scoring above the threshold value, investigating the effects of an exercise intervention (aerobic and/or resistance exercise) compared with a non-exercising control group. Results Forty-one studies, comprising 2264 participants post intervention were included in the meta-analysis demonstrating large effects (standardised mean difference (SMD)=−0.946, 95% CI −1.18 to −0.71) favouring exercise interventions which corresponds to the number needed to treat (NNT)=2 (95% CI 1.68 to 2.59). Large effects were found in studies with individuals with major depressive disorder (SMD=−0.998, 95% CI −1.39 to −0.61, k=20), supervised exercise interventions (SMD=−1.026, 95% CI −1.28 to −0.77, k=40) and moderate effects when analyses were restricted to low risk of bias studies (SMD=−0.666, 95% CI −0.99 to −0.34, k=12, NNT=2.8 (95% CI 1.94 to 5.22)). Conclusion Exercise is efficacious in treating depression and depressive symptoms and should be offered as an evidence-based treatment option focusing on supervised and group exercise with moderate intensity and aerobic exercise regimes. The small sample sizes of many trials and high heterogeneity in methods should be considered when interpreting the results.",2023-02-01,2023,Andreas Heißel; Darlene Heinen; Luisa Leonie Brokmeier; Nora Skarabis; Maria Kangas,Macquarie University,British Journal of Sports Medicine,271,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2022-106282,Cybersecurity,Meta-analysis; Medicine; Strictly standardized mean difference; PsycINFO; MEDLINE,0.3
W3177125472,Stewardship of global collective behavior,"Collective behavior provides a framework for understanding how the actions and properties of groups emerge from the way individuals generate and share information. In humans, information flows were initially shaped by natural selection yet are increasingly structured by emerging communication technologies. Our larger, more complex social networks now transfer high-fidelity information over vast distances at low cost. The digital age and the rise of social media have accelerated changes to our social systems, with poorly understood functional consequences. This gap in our knowledge represents a principal challenge to scientific progress, democracy, and actions to address global crises. We argue that the study of collective behavior must rise to a “crisis discipline” just as medicine, conservation, and climate science have, with a focus on providing actionable insight to policymakers and regulators for the stewardship of social systems.",2021-06-21,2021,Joseph B.

W3009623739,"Computational propaganda: political parties, politicians, and political manipulation on social media","This book makes a valuable contribution to the expanding field of research focusing on the online manipulation of people for political ends, and the threat posed to democracies by this new form of propaganda. Via a series of case-studies, the contributors offer a detailed illustration of how automation, scalability and anonymity offer computational propaganda not only a speed and scope of influence, but also a level of persistence and persuasiveness that distinguishes it from attempts to manipulate and mislead through leaflet drops, radio announcements and televised media. As intended by the contributors, the granular detail Computational propaganda provides about precisely how information flows through digital platforms could inform more effective regulatory responses. The case-studies present the flow of information through social media platforms and illustrate how persistent and persuasive this digitally vectored propaganda truly is. The hyperconnectivity of the digital age provides the opportunity for political actors to access the minds of whole societies around the clock and the deluge of personal data allows them to identify sympathetic targets through online surveillance and ‘persuade’ or ‘engineer’ their behaviour with precision through the use of personalized algorithms, bots, sock puppets and fake news.",2020-03-01,2020,Emily Bienvenue,Flinders University,International Affairs,266,https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaa018,Cybersecurity,Politics; Social media; Political science; Political economy; Political communication,0.492
W3003261352,Current and Emerging Developments in Subseasonal to Decadal Prediction,"Abstract Weather and climate variations on subseasonal to decadal time scales can have enormous social, economic, and environmental impacts, making skillful predictions on these time scales a valuable tool for decision-makers. As such, there is a growing interest in the scientific, operational, and applications communities in developing forecasts to improve our foreknowledge of extreme events. On subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scales, these include high-impact meteorological events such as tropical cyclones, extratropical storms, floods, droughts, and heat and cold waves. On seasonal to decadal (S2D) time scales, while the focus broadly remains similar (e.g., on precipitation, surface and upper-ocean temperatures, and their effects on the probabilities of high-impact meteorological events), understanding the roles of internal variability and externally forced variability such as anthropogenic warming in forecasts also becomes important. The S2S and S2D communities share common scientific and technical challenges. These include forecast initialization and ensemble generation; initialization shock and drift; understanding the onset of model systematic errors; bias correction, calibration, and forecast quality assessment; model resolution; atmosphere–ocean coupling; sources and expectations for predictability; and linking research, operational forecasting, and end-user needs. In September 2018 a coordinated pair of international conferences, framed by the above challenges, was organized jointly by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the World Weather Research Programme (WWRP). These conferences surveyed the state of S2S and S2D prediction, ongoing research, and future needs, providing an ideal basis for synthesizing current and emerging developments in these areas that promise to enhance future operational services.

W3194146037,Green IoT for Eco-Friendly and Sustainable Smart Cities: Future Directions and Opportunities,"Abstract The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology and their integration in smart cities have changed the way we work and live, and enriched our society. However, IoT technologies present several challenges such as increases in energy consumption, and produces toxic pollution as well as E-waste in smart cities. Smart city applications must be environmentally-friendly, hence require a move towards green IoT. Green IoT leads to an eco-friendly environment, which is more sustainable for smart cities. Therefore, it is essential to address the techniques and strategies for reducing pollution hazards, traffic waste, resource usage, energy consumption, providing public safety, life quality, and sustaining the environment and cost management. This survey focuses on providing a comprehensive review of the techniques and strategies for making cities smarter, sustainable, and eco-friendly. Furthermore, the survey focuses on IoT and its capabilities to merge into aspects of potential to address the needs of smart cities. Finally, we discuss challenges and opportunities for future research in smart city applications.",2021-08-17,2021,Faris A.

W3031736393,Pandemic leadership: Lessons from New Zealand’s approach to COVID-19,"This case study analyses the leadership approach and practices of the New Zealand government, led by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, in the response thus far to the COVID-19 pandemic. It reports on how a shared sense of purpose has been established, that of minimizing harm to lives and livelihoods, for which the government has sought – and secured – New Zealanders’ commitment. Key leadership practices comprise the government’s willingness to themselves be led by expertise, its efforts to mobilise the population, and to enable coping, all of which serve to build the trust in leadership needed for transformative, collective action such as the pandemic demands. At the time of writing, New Zealand appears well on track to achieve its ambitious goal of achieving rapid and complete control over the COVID-19 outbreak – not just ‘flattening the curve’ as other countries are struggling to do – at least in part due to these leadership contributions. A framework of good practices for pandemic leadership is offered drawn from this case study, in the hope transferable lessons can be taken to aid others in the continuing struggle to limit the harm COVID-19 poses to lives and livelihoods throughout the world.",2020-05-26,2020,Suze Wilson,Massey University,Leadership,261,https://doi.org/10.1177/1742715020929151,Cybersecurity,Public relations; Government (linguistics); Political science; Pandemic; Harm,0.208
W4210507373,A systematic review on trends in using Moodle for teaching and learning,"Abstract Background The Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) is widely used in online teaching and learning, especially in STEM education. However, educational research on using Moodle is scattered throughout the literature. Therefore, this review aims to summarise this research to assist three sets of stakeholders—educators, researchers, and software developers. It identifies: (a) how and where Moodle has been adopted; (b) what the concerns, trends, and gaps are to lead future research and software development; and (c) innovative and effective methods for improving online teaching and learning. The review used the 4-step PRISMA-P process to identify 155 suitable journal articles from 104 journals in 55 countries published from January 2015 to June 2021. The database search was conducted with Scopus and Web of Science. Insights into the educational use of Moodle were determined through bibliometric analysis with Vosviewer outputs and thematic analysis. Results This review shows that Moodle is mainly used within University STEM disciplines and effectively improves student performance, satisfaction, and engagement. Moodle is increasingly being used as a platform for adaptive and collaborative learning and used to improve online assessments. The use of Moodle is developing rapidly to address academic integrity, ethics, and security issues to enhance speed and navigation, and incorporate artificial intelligence. Conclusion More qualitative research is required on the use of Moodle, particularly investigating educators’ perspectives. Further research is also needed on the use of Moodle in non-STEM and non-tertiary disciplines. Further studies need to incorporate educational theories when designing courses using the Moodle platform.",2022-01-25,2022,Sithara H. P. W. Gamage; Jennifer R.

W3092213406,Missed nursing care: An overview of reviews,"Abstract Missed nursing care is care that is delayed, partially completed, or not completed at all. The aim of this overview of reviews was to identify the nursing care that is missed, the factors that influence missed nursing care and the outcomes from it. To be included, reviews had to use the systematic review process and focus on hospital care. Databases were searched from inception until August sixth, 2020. One author screened the papers and extracted data on included reviews and a second checked this. Two authors independently assessed the quality of the reviews. Seven reviews were included in this overview. Categories of care missed included: (a) communication and information sharing; (b) self‐management, autonomy, and education including care planning, discharge planning and decision; (c) fundamental physical care; and (d) emotional and psychological care including spiritual support. Factors associated with missed care were related to staffing levels and/or labor resources skill mix, material resources not being available, patient acuity and teamwork/communication. Outcomes of missed nursing care included: less/poorer quality of patient care, patient satisfaction, and nurses' job satisfaction, increased patient adverse events, and the organizational outcomes of increasing hospital length of stay and hospital readmission. In‐depth qualitative and mixed methods research is needed to better understand how nurses prioritize care and why care is missed. Longitudinal and experimental research is required to better clarify if these relationships between missed care and negative patient outcomes are likely cause and effect.",2020-10-06,2020,Wendy Chaboyer; Emma Harbeck; Bih‐O Lee; Laurie Grealish,Griffith University,The Kaohsiung Journal of Medical Sciences,255,https://doi.org/10.1002/kjm2.12308,Cybersecurity,Medicine; Nursing; Staffing; Autonomy; Nursing care,0.208
W3097229464,Points to consider for the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases with Janus kinase inhibitors: a consensus statement,"Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) have been approved for use in various immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. With five agents licensed, it was timely to summarise the current understanding of JAKi use based on a systematic literature review (SLR) on efficacy and safety.Existing data were evaluated by a steering committee and subsequently reviewed by a 29 person expert committee leading to the formulation of a consensus statement that may assist the clinicians, patients and other stakeholders once the decision is made to commence a JAKi. The committee included patients, rheumatologists, a gastroenterologist, a haematologist, a dermatologist, an infectious disease specialist and a health professional. The SLR informed the Task Force on controlled and open clinical trials, registry data, phase 4 trials and meta-analyses. In addition, approval of new compounds by, and warnings from regulators that were issued after the end of the SLR search date were taken into consideration.The Task Force agreed on and developed four general principles and a total of 26 points for consideration which were grouped into six areas addressing indications, treatment dose and comedication, contraindications, pretreatment screening and risks, laboratory and clinical follow-up examinations, and adverse events. Levels of evidence and strengths of recommendations were determined based on the SLR and levels of agreement were voted on for every point, reaching a range between 8.8 and 9.9 on a 10-point scale.The consensus provides an assessment of evidence for efficacy and safety of an important therapeutic class with guidance on issues of practical management.",2020-11-06,2020,Peter Nash; Andreas Kerschbaumer; Thomas Dörner; Maxime Dougados; Roy Fleischmann,Griffith University,Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,254,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-218398,Cybersecurity,Medicine; Clinical trial; Task force; Adverse effect; Alternative medicine,0.15
W3190450040,Vacancy-defect modulated pathway of photoreduction of CO2 on single atomically thin AgInP2S6 sheets into olefiant gas,"Abstract Artificial photosynthesis, light-driving CO 2 conversion into hydrocarbon fuels, is a promising strategy to synchronously overcome global warming and energy-supply issues. The quaternary AgInP 2 S 6 atomic layer with the thickness of ~ 0.70 nm were successfully synthesized through facile ultrasonic exfoliation of the corresponding bulk crystal. The sulfur defect engineering on this atomic layer through a H 2 O 2 etching treatment can excitingly change the CO 2 photoreduction reaction pathway to steer dominant generation of ethene with the yield-based selectivity reaching ~73% and the electron-based selectivity as high as ~89%. Both DFT calculation and in-situ FTIR spectra demonstrate that as the introduction of S vacancies in AgInP 2 S 6 causes the charge accumulation on the Ag atoms near the S vacancies, the exposed Ag sites can thus effectively capture the forming *CO molecules. It makes the catalyst surface enrich with key reaction intermediates to lower the C-C binding coupling barrier, which facilitates the production of ethene.",2021-08-06,2021,Wa Gao; Li Shi; Huichao He; Xiaoning Li; Zhenxiang Cheng,University of Wollongong,Nature Communications,253,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25068-7,Cybersecurity,Selectivity; Materials science; Exfoliation joint; Catalysis; Sulfur,0.225
W3164618783,Blinding and expectancy confounds in psychedelic randomized controlled trials,"Introduction: There is increasing interest in the potential for psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin, LSD and ketamine to treat several mental health disorders, with a growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) being conducted to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness of psychedelics.Areas covered: We review previous literature on expectancy effects and blinding in the context of psychedelic RCTs – literature which strongly suggest that psychedelic RCTs might be confounded by de-blinding and expectancy. We conduct systematic reviews of psychedelic RCTs using Medline, PsychInfo and EMBASE (Jan 1990 – Nov 2020) and show that currently reported psychedelic RCTs have generally not reported pre-trial expectancy, nor the success of blinding procedures.Expert opinion: While psychedelic RCTs have generally shown promising results, with large effect sizes reported, we argue that treatment effect sizes in psychedelic RCTs are likely over-estimated due to de-blinding of participants and high levels of response expectancy. We suggest that psychedelic RCTs should routinely measure de-blinding and expectancy. Careful attention should be paid to clinical trial design and the instructions given to participants to allow these confounds to be reduced, estimated and removed from effect size estimates. We urge caution in interpreting effect size estimates from extant psychedelic RCTs.",2021-05-26,2021,Suresh Muthukumaraswamy; Anna Forsyth; Thomas Lumley,University of Auckland,Expert Review of Clinical Pharmacology,249,https://doi.org/10.1080/17512433.2021.1933434,Cybersecurity,Blinding; Expectancy theory; Randomized controlled trial; Medicine; Context (archaeology),0.225
W4402665833,Large Language Models for Software Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted numerous domains, including Software Engineering (SE). Many recent publications have explored LLMs applied to various SE tasks. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the application, effects, and possible limitations of LLMs on SE is still in its early stages. To bridge this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) on LLM4SE, with a particular focus on understanding how LLMs can be exploited to optimize processes and outcomes. We selected and analyzed 395 research papers from January 2017 to January 2024 to answer four key research questions (RQs). In RQ1, we categorize different LLMs that have been employed in SE tasks, characterizing their distinctive features and uses. In RQ2, we analyze the methods used in data collection, preprocessing, and application, highlighting the role of well-curated datasets for successful LLM for SE implementation. RQ3 investigates the strategies employed to optimize and evaluate the performance of LLMs in SE. Finally, RQ4 examines the specific SE tasks where LLMs have shown success to date, illustrating their practical contributions to the field. From the answers to these RQs, we discuss the current state-of-the-art and trends, identifying gaps in existing research, and highlighting promising areas for future study.

W2979981663,A community-based transcriptomics classification and nomenclature of neocortical cell types,"To understand the function of cortical circuits, it is necessary to catalog their cellular diversity. Past attempts to do so using anatomical, physiological or molecular features of cortical cells have not resulted in a unified taxonomy of neuronal or glial cell types, partly due to limited data. Single-cell transcriptomics is enabling, for the first time, systematic high-throughput measurements of cortical cells and generation of datasets that hold the promise of being complete, accurate and permanent. Statistical analyses of these data reveal clusters that often correspond to cell types previously defined by morphological or physiological criteria and that appear conserved across cortical areas and species. To capitalize on these new methods, we propose the adoption of a transcriptome-based taxonomy of cell types for mammalian neocortex. This classification should be hierarchical and use a standardized nomenclature. It should be based on a probabilistic definition of a cell type and incorporate data from different approaches, developmental stages and species. A community-based classification and data aggregation model, such as a knowledge graph, could provide a common foundation for the study of cortical circuits. This community-based classification, nomenclature and data aggregation could serve as an example for cell type atlases in other parts of the body.",2020-08-24,2020,Rafael Yuste; Michael Hawrylycz; Nadia Aalling; Argel Aguilar‐Valles; Detlev Arendt,Macquarie University,Nature Neuroscience,248,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-0685-8,Cybersecurity,Cell type; Nomenclature; Neuroscience; Neocortex; Biology,0.15
W3125960586,"Agriculture Development, Pesticide Application and Its Impact on the Environment","Pesticides are indispensable in agricultural production. They have been used by farmers to control weeds and insects, and their remarkable increases in agricultural products have been reported. The increase in the world’s population in the 20th century could not have been possible without a parallel increase in food production. About one-third of agricultural products are produced depending on the application of pesticides. Without the use of pesticides, there would be a 78% loss of fruit production, a 54% loss of vegetable production, and a 32% loss of cereal production. Therefore, pesticides play a critical role in reducing diseases and increasing crop yields worldwide. Thus, it is essential to discuss the agricultural development process; the historical perspective, types and specific uses of pesticides; and pesticide behavior, its contamination, and adverse effects on the natural environment. The review study indicates that agricultural development has a long history in many places around the world. The history of pesticide use can be divided into three periods of time. Pesticides are classified by different classification terms such as chemical classes, functional groups, modes of action, and toxicity. Pesticides are used to kill pests and control weeds using chemical ingredients; hence, they can also be toxic to other organisms, including birds, fish, beneficial insects, and non-target plants, as well as air, water, soil, and crops. Moreover, pesticide contamination moves away from the target plants, resulting in environmental pollution. Such chemical residues impact human health through environmental and food contamination. In addition, climate change-related factors also impact on pesticide application and result in increased pesticide usage and pesticide pollution. Therefore, this review will provide the scientific information necessary for pesticide application and management in the future.",2021-01-27,2021,Muyesaier Tudi; Huada Daniel Ruan; Li Wang; Jia Lyu; Ross Sadler,Griffith University,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,1963,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031112,Energy_Sustainability,Agriculture; Pesticide; Environmental science; Environmental planning; Environmental health,0.283
W4386706488,Earth beyond six of nine planetary boundaries,"This planetary boundaries framework update finds that six of the nine boundaries are transgressed, suggesting that Earth is now well outside of the safe operating space for humanity. Ocean acidification is close to being breached, while aerosol loading regionally exceeds the boundary. Stratospheric ozone levels have slightly recovered. The transgression level has increased for all boundaries earlier identified as overstepped. As primary production drives Earth system biosphere functions, human appropriation of net primary production is proposed as a control variable for functional biosphere integrity. This boundary is also transgressed. Earth system modeling of different levels of the transgression of the climate and land system change boundaries illustrates that these anthropogenic impacts on Earth system must be considered in a systemic context.",2023-09-13,2023,Katherine Richardson; Will Steffen; Wolfgang Lucht; Jørgen Bendtsen; Sarah Cornell,Australian National University,Science Advances,1748,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adh2458,Energy_Sustainability,Biosphere; Planetary boundaries; Context (archaeology); Earth system science; Boundary (topology),0.283
W3016207602,Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2: The world should face the reality,"Hand washing and maintaining social distance are the main measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to avoid contracting COVID-19. Unfortunately, these measured do not prevent infection by inhalation of small droplets exhaled by an infected person that can travel distance of meters or tens of meters in the air and carry their viral content. Science explains the mechanisms of such transport and there is evidence that this is a significant route of infection in indoor environments. Despite this, no countries or authorities consider airborne spread of COVID-19 in their regulations to prevent infections transmission indoors. It is therefore extremely important, that the national authorities acknowledge the reality that the virus spreads through air, and recommend that adequate control measures be implemented to prevent further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in particularly removal of the virus-laden droplets from indoor air by ventilation.",2020-04-10,2020,Lídia Morawska; Junji Cao,Queensland University of Technology,Environment International,1741,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105730,Energy_Sustainability,Airborne transmission; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); Face masks; Transmission (telecommunications),0.208
W3006332078,Plant responses to rising vapor pressure deficit,"Summary Recent decades have been characterized by increasing temperatures worldwide, resulting in an exponential climb in vapor pressure deficit (VPD). VPD has been identified as an increasingly important driver of plant functioning in terrestrial biomes and has been established as a major contributor in recent drought‐induced plant mortality independent of other drivers associated with climate change. Despite this, few studies have isolated the physiological response of plant functioning to high VPD, thus limiting our understanding and ability to predict future impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. An abundance of evidence suggests that stomatal conductance declines under high VPD and transpiration increases in most species up until a given VPD threshold, leading to a cascade of subsequent impacts including reduced photosynthesis and growth, and higher risks of carbon starvation and hydraulic failure . Incorporation of photosynthetic and hydraulic traits in ‘next‐generation’ land‐surface models has the greatest potential for improved prediction of VPD responses at the plant‐ and global‐scale, and will yield more mechanistic simulations of plant responses to a changing climate. By providing a fully integrated framework and evaluation of the impacts of high VPD on plant function, improvements in forecasting and long‐term projections of climate impacts can be made.",2020-02-17,2020,Charlotte Grossiord; Thomas N.

W3023535864,Phytoremediation: A Promising Approach for Revegetation of Heavy Metal-Polluted Land,"Heavy metal accumulation in soil has been rapidly increased due to various natural processes and anthropogenic (industrial) activities. As heavy metals are non-biodegradable, they persist in the environment, have potential to enter the food chain through crop plants and eventually may accumulate in human body through biomagnification. Due to their toxic nature, heavy metal contamination has posed a serious threat to human health and the ecosystem. Therefore, remediation of land contamination is of paramount importance. Phytoremediation is an eco-friendly approach that could be a successful mitigation measure to revegetate heavy metal-polluted soil in a cost effective way. To improve the efficiency of phytoremediation, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying heavy metal accumulation and tolerance in plant is indispensable. In this review, we describe the mechanisms of how heavy metals are taken up, translocated and detoxified in plants. We focus on the strategies applied to improve the efficiency of phytostabilization and phytoextraction, including the application of genetic engineering, microbe-assisted and chelate-assisted approaches.",2020-04-30,2020,Yan An; Yamin Wang; Swee Ngin Tan; Mohamed Lokman Mohd Yusof; Subhadip Ghosh,University of New England,Frontiers in Plant Science,1367,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.00359,Energy_Sustainability,Phytoremediation; Environmental remediation; Biomagnification; Environmental science; Revegetation,0.283
W3028066085,Global threat of arsenic in groundwater,"Dowsing for danger Arsenic is a metabolic poison that is present in minute quantities in most rock materials and, under certain natural conditions, can accumulate in aquifers and cause adverse health effects. Podgorski and Berg used measurements of arsenic in groundwater from ∼80 previous studies to train a machine-learning model with globally continuous predictor variables, including climate, soil, and topography (see the Perspective by Zheng). The output global map reveals the potential for hazard from arsenic contamination in groundwater, even in many places where there are sparse or no reported measurements. The highest-risk regions include areas of southern and central Asia and South America. Understanding arsenic hazard is especially essential in areas facing current or future water insecurity.

W4212893393,Pharmaceutical pollution of the world’s rivers,"Environmental exposure to active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) can have negative effects on the health of ecosystems and humans. While numerous studies have monitored APIs in rivers, these employ different analytical methods, measure different APIs, and have ignored many of the countries of the world. This makes it difficult to quantify the scale of the problem from a global perspective. Furthermore, comparison of the existing data, generated for different studies/regions/continents, is challenging due to the vast differences between the analytical methodologies employed. Here, we present a global-scale study of API pollution in 258 of the world's rivers, representing the environmental influence of 471.4 million people across 137 geographic regions. Samples were obtained from 1,052 locations in 104 countries (representing all continents and 36 countries not previously studied for API contamination) and analyzed for 61 APIs. Highest cumulative API concentrations were observed in sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, and South America. The most contaminated sites were in low- to middle-income countries and were associated with areas with poor wastewater and waste management infrastructure and pharmaceutical manufacturing. The most frequently detected APIs were carbamazepine, metformin, and caffeine (a compound also arising from lifestyle use), which were detected at over half of the sites monitored. Concentrations of at least one API at 25.7% of the sampling sites were greater than concentrations considered safe for aquatic organisms, or which are of concern in terms of selection for antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, pharmaceutical pollution poses a global threat to environmental and human health, as well as to delivery of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",2022-02-14,2022,John L.

W2982687801,Bending the Curve of Global Freshwater Biodiversity Loss: An Emergency Recovery Plan,"Despite their limited spatial extent, freshwater ecosystems host remarkable biodiversity, including one-third of all vertebrate species. This biodiversity is declining dramatically: Globally, wetlands are vanishing three times faster than forests, and freshwater vertebrate populations have fallen more than twice as steeply as terrestrial or marine populations. Threats to freshwater biodiversity are well documented but coordinated action to reverse the decline is lacking. We present an Emergency Recovery Plan to bend the curve of freshwater biodiversity loss. Priority actions include accelerating implementation of environmental flows; improving water quality; protecting and restoring critical habitats; managing the exploitation of freshwater ecosystem resources, especially species and riverine aggregates; preventing and controlling nonnative species invasions; and safeguarding and restoring river connectivity.

Here, we use modelling and literature assessment to quantify safe and just Earth system boundaries (ESBs) for climate, the biosphere, water and nutrient cycles, and aerosols at global and subglobal scales. We propose ESBs for maintaining the resilience and stability of the Earth system (safe ESBs) and minimizing exposure to significant harm to humans from Earth system change (a necessary but not sufficient condition for justice) 4 . The stricter of the safe or just boundaries sets the integrated safe and just ESB. Our findings show that justice considerations constrain the integrated ESBs more than safety considerations for climate and atmospheric aerosol loading. Seven of eight globally quantified safe and just ESBs and at least two regional safe and just ESBs in over half of global land area are already exceeded.

Here, we present an interdisciplinary study of the environmental, social and economic consequences of land-use transitions in a tropical smallholder landscape on Sumatra, Indonesia. We find widespread biodiversity-profit trade-offs resulting from land-use transitions from forest and agroforestry systems to rubber and oil palm monocultures, for 26,894 aboveground and belowground species and whole-ecosystem multidiversity. Despite variation between ecosystem functions, profit gains come at the expense of ecosystem multifunctionality, indicating far-reaching ecosystem deterioration. We identify landscape compositions that can mitigate trade-offs under optimal land-use allocation but also show that intensive monocultures always lead to higher profits. These findings suggest that, to reduce losses in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, changes in economic incentive structures through well-designed policies are urgently needed.",2020-03-04,2020,Ingo Graß; Christoph Kubitza; Vijesh V.

W3021690023,Estimation of airborne viral emission: Quanta emission rate of SARS-CoV-2 for infection risk assessment,"Airborne transmission is a pathway of contagion that is still not sufficiently investigated despite the evidence in the scientific literature of the role it can play in the context of an epidemic. While the medical research area dedicates efforts to find cures and remedies to counteract the effects of a virus, the engineering area is involved in providing risk assessments in indoor environments by simulating the airborne transmission of the virus during an epidemic. To this end, virus air emission data are needed. Unfortunately, this information is usually available only after the outbreak, based on specific reverse engineering cases. In this work, a novel approach to estimate the viral load emitted by a contagious subject on the basis of the viral load in the mouth, the type of respiratory activity (e.g. breathing, speaking, whispering), respiratory physiological parameters (e.g. inhalation rate), and activity level (e.g. resting, standing, light exercise) is proposed. The results showed that high quanta emission rates (>100 quanta h−1) can be reached by an asymptomatic infectious SARS-CoV-2 subject performing vocalization during light activities (i.e. walking slowly) whereas a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in resting conditions mostly has a low quanta emission rate (<1 quantum h−1). The findings in terms of quanta emission rates were then adopted in infection risk models to demonstrate its application by evaluating the number of people infected by an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in Italian indoor microenvironments before and after the introduction of virus containment measures. The results obtained from the simulations clearly highlight that a key role is played by proper ventilation in containment of the virus in indoor environments.",2020-05-11,2020,Giorgio Buonanno; Luca Stabile; Lídia Morawska,Queensland University of Technology,Environment International,740,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105794,Energy_Sustainability,Context (archaeology); Asymptomatic; Transmission (telecommunications); Asymptomatic carrier; Infection rate,0.342
W3097532599,"Progress in biomass torrefaction: Principles, applications and challenges","The development of biofuels has been considered as an important countermeasure to abate anthropogenic CO2 emissions, suppress deteriorated atmospheric greenhouse effect, and mitigate global warming. To produce biofuels from biomass, thermochemical conversion processes are considered as the most efficient routes wherein torrefaction has the lowest global warming potential. Combustion is the easiest way to consume biomass, which can be burned alone or co-fired with coal to generate heat and power. However, solid biomass fuels are not commonly applied in the industry due to their characteristics of hygroscopic nature and high moisture content, low bulk density and calorific value, poor grindability, low compositional homogeneity, and lower resistance against biological degradation. In recently developing biomass conversion technologies, torrefaction has attracted much attention since it can effectively upgrade solid biomass and produce coal-like fuel. Torrefaction is categorized into dry and wet torrefaction; the former can further be split into non-oxidative and oxidative torrefaction. Despite numerous methods developed, non-oxidative torrefaction, normally termed torrefaction, has a higher potential for practical applications and commercialization when compared to other methods. To provide a comprehensive review of the progress in biomass torrefaction technologies, this study aims to perform an in-depth literature survey of torrefaction principles, processes, systems, and to identify a current trend in practical torrefaction development and environmental performance. Moreover, the encountered challenges and perspectives from torrefaction development are underlined. This state-of-the-art review is conducive to the production and applications of biochar for resource utilization and environmental sustainability. To date, several kinds of reactors have been developed, while there is still no obviously preferred one as they simultaneously have pros and cons. Integrating torrefaction with other processes such as co-firing, gasification, pyrolysis, and ironmaking, etc., makes it more efficient and economically feasible in contrast to using a single process. By virtue of capturing carbon dioxide during the growth stage of biomass, negative carbon emissions can even be achieved from torrefied biomass.",2020-10-26,2020,Wei‐Hsin Chen; Bo-Jhih Lin; Yu‐Ying Lin; Yen-Shih Chu; Aristotle T.

W3125213608,"Forest microclimates and climate change: Importance, drivers and future research agenda","Abstract Forest microclimates contrast strongly with the climate outside forests. To fully understand and better predict how forests' biodiversity and functions relate to climate and climate change, microclimates need to be integrated into ecological research. Despite the potentially broad impact of microclimates on the response of forest ecosystems to global change, our understanding of how microclimates within and below tree canopies modulate biotic responses to global change at the species, community and ecosystem level is still limited. Here, we review how spatial and temporal variation in forest microclimates result from an interplay of forest features, local water balance, topography and landscape composition. We first stress and exemplify the importance of considering forest microclimates to understand variation in biodiversity and ecosystem functions across forest landscapes. Next, we explain how macroclimate warming (of the free atmosphere) can affect microclimates, and vice versa, via interactions with land‐use changes across different biomes. Finally, we perform a priority ranking of future research avenues at the interface of microclimate ecology and global change biology, with a specific focus on three key themes: (1) disentangling the abiotic and biotic drivers and feedbacks of forest microclimates; (2) global and regional mapping and predictions of forest microclimates; and (3) the impacts of microclimate on forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the face of climate change. The availability of microclimatic data will significantly increase in the coming decades, characterizing climate variability at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales relevant to biological processes in forests. This will revolutionize our understanding of the dynamics, drivers and implications of forest microclimates on biodiversity and ecological functions, and the impacts of global changes. In order to support the sustainable use of forests and to secure their biodiversity and ecosystem services for future generations, microclimates cannot be ignored.",2021-03-16,2021,Pieter De Frenne; Jonathan Lenoir; Miska Luoto; Brett R.

W3100991075,County-level CO2 emissions and sequestration in China during 1997–2017,"Abstract With the implementation of China’s top-down CO 2 emissions reduction strategy, the regional differences should be considered. As the most basic governmental unit in China, counties could better capture the regional heterogeneity than provinces and prefecture-level city, and county-level CO 2 emissions could be used for the development of strategic policies tailored to local conditions. However, most of the previous accounts of CO 2 emissions in China have only focused on the national, provincial, or city levels, owing to limited methods and smaller-scale data. In this study, a particle swarm optimization-back propagation (PSO-BP) algorithm was employed to unify the scale of DMSP/OLS and NPP/VIIRS satellite imagery and estimate the CO 2 emissions in 2,735 Chinese counties during 1997–2017. Moreover, as vegetation has a significant ability to sequester and reduce CO 2 emissions, we calculated the county-level carbon sequestration value of terrestrial vegetation. The results presented here can contribute to existing data gaps and enable the development of strategies to reduce CO 2 emissions in China.",2020-11-12,2020,Jiandong Chen; Ming Gao; Shulei Cheng; Wenxuan Hou; Malin Song,Curtin University,Scientific Data,713,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00736-3,Energy_Sustainability,China; Carbon sequestration; Environmental science; Vegetation (pathology); Unit (ring theory),0.55
W3016394488,Hanging by a thread? Forests and drought,"Trees are the living foundations on which most terrestrial biodiversity is built. Central to the success of trees are their woody bodies, which connect their elevated photosynthetic canopies with the essential belowground activities of water and nutrient acquisition. The slow construction of these carbon-dense, woody skeletons leads to a slow generation time, leaving trees and forests highly susceptible to rapid changes in climate. Other long-lived, sessile organisms such as corals appear to be poorly equipped to survive rapid changes, which raises questions about the vulnerability of contemporary forests to future climate change. The emerging view that, similar to corals, tree species have rather inflexible damage thresholds, particularly in terms of water stress, is especially concerning.

W3128638349,The soundscape of the Anthropocene ocean,"Oceans have become substantially noisier since the Industrial Revolution. Shipping, resource exploration, and infrastructure development have increased the anthrophony (sounds generated by human activities), whereas the biophony (sounds of biological origin) has been reduced by hunting, fishing, and habitat degradation. Climate change is affecting geophony (abiotic, natural sounds). Existing evidence shows that anthrophony affects marine animals at multiple levels, including their behavior, physiology, and, in extreme cases, survival.

W3145334583,Fertilizers and nitrate pollution of surface and ground water: an increasingly pervasive global problem,"Abstract Nitrate pollution of ground and surface water bodies all over the world is generally linked with continually increasing global fertilizer nitrogen (N) use. But after 1990, with more fertilizer N consumption in developing countries especially in East and South Asia than in the industrialized nations in North America and Europe, nitrate pollution of freshwaters is now increasingly becoming a pervasive global problem. In this review it has been attempted to review the research information generated during the last two decades from all over the world on different aspects of nitrate pollution of natural water bodies. It is now evident that not more than 50% of the fertilizer N is directly used by the crops to which it is applied. While a small portion may directly leach down and may reach ground and surface water bodies, a large proportion ends up in the soil organic N pool from where N is mineralized and is taken up by plants and/or lost via leaching during several decades. Present trends of nitrate pollution of freshwaters, therefore, reflect legacies of current and past applications of fertilizers and manures. Tools such as simulation models and the natural variation in the stable isotopes of N and oxygen are now being extensively used to study the contribution of fertilizers and other sources to nitrate enrichment of freshwaters. Impacts of agricultural stewardship measures are being assessed and nitrate enrichment of water bodies is being managed using modern digital models and frameworks. Improved water and fertilizer management in agroecosystems can reduce the contribution of fertilizers to nitrate pollution of water bodies but a host of factors determine the magnitude. Future research needs are also considered.",2021-03-31,2021,Bijay Sıngh; E. T.

W3181205698,"Global, regional, and national burden of mortality associated with non-optimal ambient temperatures from 2000 to 2019: a three-stage modelling study","BackgroundExposure to cold or hot temperatures is associated with premature deaths. We aimed to evaluate the global, regional, and national mortality burden associated with non-optimal ambient temperatures.MethodsIn this modelling study, we collected time-series data on mortality and ambient temperatures from 750 locations in 43 countries and five meta-predictors at a grid size of 0·5° × 0·5° across the globe. A three-stage analysis strategy was used. First, the temperature–mortality association was fitted for each location by use of a time-series regression. Second, a multivariate meta-regression model was built between location-specific estimates and meta-predictors. Finally, the grid-specific temperature–mortality association between 2000 and 2019 was predicted by use of the fitted meta-regression and the grid-specific meta-predictors. Excess deaths due to non-optimal temperatures, the ratio between annual excess deaths and all deaths of a year (the excess death ratio), and the death rate per 100 000 residents were then calculated for each grid across the world. Grids were divided according to regional groupings of the UN Statistics Division.FindingsGlobally, 5 083 173 deaths (95% empirical CI [eCI] 4 087 967–5 965 520) were associated with non-optimal temperatures per year, accounting for 9·43% (95% eCI 7·58–11·07) of all deaths (8·52% [6·19–10·47] were cold-related and 0·91% [0·56–1·36] were heat-related). There were 74 temperature-related excess deaths per 100 000 residents (95% eCI 60–87). The mortality burden varied geographically. Of all excess deaths, 2 617 322 (51·49%) occurred in Asia. Eastern Europe had the highest heat-related excess death rate and Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest cold-related excess death rate. From 2000–03 to 2016–19, the global cold-related excess death ratio changed by −0·51 percentage points (95% eCI −0·61 to −0·42) and the global heat-related excess death ratio increased by 0·21 percentage points (0·13–0·31), leading to a net reduction in the overall ratio. The largest decline in overall excess death ratio occurred in South-eastern Asia, whereas excess death ratio fluctuated in Southern Asia and Europe.InterpretationNon-optimal temperatures are associated with a substantial mortality burden, which varies spatiotemporally.

W3003821312,Global meta-analysis shows pervasive phosphorus limitation of aboveground plant production in natural terrestrial ecosystems,"Phosphorus (P) limitation of aboveground plant production is usually assumed to occur in tropical regions but rarely elsewhere. Here we report that such P limitation is more widespread and much stronger than previously estimated. In our global meta-analysis, almost half (46.2%) of 652 P-addition field experiments reveal a significant P limitation on aboveground plant production. Globally, P additions increase aboveground plant production by 34.9% in natural terrestrial ecosystems, which is 7.0-15.9% higher than previously suggested. In croplands, by contrast, P additions increase aboveground plant production by only 13.9%, probably because of historical fertilizations. The magnitude of P limitation also differs among climate zones and regions, and is driven by climate, ecosystem properties, and fertilization regimes. In addition to confirming that P limitation is widespread in tropical regions, our study demonstrates that P limitation often occurs in other regions. This suggests that previous studies have underestimated the importance of altered P supply on aboveground plant production in natural terrestrial ecosystems.",2020-01-31,2020,Enqing Hou; Yiqi Luo; Yuanwen Kuang; Chengrong Chen; X.

W3003324864,"Coral restoration – A systematic review of current methods, successes, failures and future directions","Coral reef ecosystems have suffered an unprecedented loss of habitat-forming hard corals in recent decades. While marine conservation has historically focused on passive habitat protection, demand for and interest in active restoration has been growing in recent decades. However, a disconnect between coral restoration practitioners, coral reef managers and scientists has resulted in a disjointed field where it is difficult to gain an overview of existing knowledge. To address this, we aimed to synthesise the available knowledge in a comprehensive global review of coral restoration methods, incorporating data from the peer-reviewed scientific literature, complemented with grey literature and through a survey of coral restoration practitioners. We found that coral restoration case studies are dominated by short-term projects, with 60% of all projects reporting less than 18 months of monitoring of the restored sites. Similarly, most projects are relatively small in spatial scale, with a median size of restored area of 100 m2. A diverse range of species are represented in the dataset, with 229 different species from 72 coral genera. Overall, coral restoration projects focused primarily on fast-growing branching corals (59% of studies), and report survival between 60 and 70%. To date, the relatively young field of coral restoration has been plagued by similar 'growing pains' as ecological restoration in other ecosystems. These include 1) a lack of clear and achievable objectives, 2) a lack of appropriate and standardised monitoring and reporting and, 3) poorly designed projects in relation to stated objectives. Mitigating these will be crucial to successfully scale up projects, and to retain public trust in restoration as a tool for resilience based management. Finally, while it is clear that practitioners have developed effective methods to successfully grow corals at small scales, it is critical not to view restoration as a replacement for meaningful action on climate change.",2020-01-30,2020,Lisa Boström‐Einarsson; Russell C.

W4387344519,Ongoing declines for the world’s amphibians in the face of emerging threats,"Abstract Systematic assessments of species extinction risk at regular intervals are necessary for informing conservation action 1,2 . Ongoing developments in taxonomy, threatening processes and research further underscore the need for reassessment 3,4 . Here we report the findings of the second Global Amphibian Assessment, evaluating 8,011 species for the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. We find that amphibians are the most threatened vertebrate class (40.7% of species are globally threatened). The updated Red List Index shows that the status of amphibians is deteriorating globally, particularly for salamanders and in the Neotropics. Disease and habitat loss drove 91% of status deteriorations between 1980 and 2004. Ongoing and projected climate change effects are now of increasing concern, driving 39% of status deteriorations since 2004, followed by habitat loss (37%). Although signs of species recoveries incentivize immediate conservation action, scaled-up investment is urgently needed to reverse the current trends.",2023-10-04,2023,Jennifer Luedtke; Janice Chanson; Kelsey Neam; Louise Hobin; Adriano Oliveira Maciel,James Cook University,Nature,470,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06578-4,Energy_Sustainability,Threatened species; IUCN Red List; Conservation status; Habitat; Habitat destruction,0.283
W2999123806,Chromium Bioaccumulation and Its Impacts on Plants: An Overview,"Chromium (Cr) is an element naturally occurring in rocky soils and volcanic dust. It has been classified as a carcinogen agent according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Therefore, this metal needs an accurate understanding and thorough investigation in soil-plant systems. Due to its high solubility, Cr (VI) is regarded as a hazardous ion, which contaminates groundwater and can be transferred through the food chain. Cr also negatively impacts the growth of plants by impairing their essential metabolic processes. The toxic effects of Cr are correlated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause oxidative stress in plants. The current review summarizes the understanding of Cr toxicity in plants via discussing the possible mechanisms involved in its uptake, translocation and sub-cellular distribution, along with its interference with the other plant metabolic processes such as chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis and plant defensive system.",2020-01-13,2020,Anket Sharma; Dhriti Kapoor; Junfeng Wang; Babar Shahzad; Vinod Kumar,University of Tasmania,Plants,444,https://doi.org/10.3390/plants9010100,Energy_Sustainability,Bioaccumulation; Chromium; Environmental science; Environmental chemistry; Metallurgy,0.208
W3004942926,Seamless retrievals of chlorophyll-a from Sentinel-2 (MSI) and Sentinel-3 (OLCI) in inland and coastal waters: A machine-learning approach,"Consistent, cross-mission retrievals of near-surface concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla) in various aquatic ecosystems with broad ranges of trophic levels have long been a complex undertaking. Here, we introduce a machine-learning model, the Mixture Density Network (MDN), that largely outperforms existing algorithms when applied across different bio-optical regimes in inland and coastal waters. The model is trained and validated using a sizeable database of co-located Chla measurements (n = 2943) and in situ hyperspectral radiometric data resampled to simulate the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and the Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-2A/B and Sentinel-3A/B, respectively. Our performance evaluations of the model, via two-thirds of the in situ dataset with Chla ranging from 0.2 to 1209 mg/m3 and a mean Chla of 21.7 mg/m3, suggest significant improvements in Chla retrievals. For both MSI and OLCI, the mean absolute logarithmic error (MAE) and logarithmic bias (Bias) across the entire range reduced by 40–60%, whereas the root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) and the median absolute percentage error (MAPE) improved two-to-three times over those from the state-of-the-art algorithms. Using independent Chla matchups (n < 800) for Sentinel-2A/B and -3A, we show that the MDN model provides most accurate products from recorded images processed via three different atmospheric correction processors, namely the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS), POLYMER, and ACOLITE, though the model is found to be sensitive to uncertainties in remote-sensing reflectance products. This manuscript serves as a preliminary study on a machine-learning algorithm with potential utility in seamless construction of Chla data records in inland and coastal waters, i.e., harmonized, comparable products via a single algorithm for MSI and OLCI data processing. The model performance is anticipated to enhance by improving the global representativeness of the training data as well as simultaneous retrievals of multiple optically active components of the water column.",2020-02-07,2020,Nima Pahlevan; Brandon Smith; John F.

W4283641177,Extreme weather impacts of climate change: an attribution perspective,"Abstract Extreme event attribution aims to elucidate the link between global climate change, extreme weather events, and the harms experienced on the ground by people, property, and nature. It therefore allows the disentangling of different drivers of extreme weather from human-induced climate change and hence provides valuable information to adapt to climate change and to assess loss and damage. However, providing such assessments systematically is currently out of reach. This is due to limitations in attribution science, including the capacity for studying different types of events, as well as the geographical heterogeneity of both climate and impact data availability. Here, we review current knowledge of the influences of climate change on five different extreme weather hazards (extreme temperatures, heavy rainfall, drought, wildfire, tropical cyclones), the impacts of recent extreme weather events of each type, and thus the degree to which various impacts are attributable to climate change. For instance, heat extremes have increased in likelihood and intensity worldwide due to climate change, with tens of thousands of deaths directly attributable. This is likely a significant underestimate due to the limited availability of impact information in lower- and middle-income countries. Meanwhile, tropical cyclone rainfall and storm surge height have increased for individual events and across all basins. In the North Atlantic basin, climate change amplified the rainfall of events that, combined, caused half a trillion USD in damages. At the same time, severe droughts in many parts of the world are not attributable to climate change. To advance our understanding of present-day extreme weather impacts due to climate change developments on several levels are required. These include improving the recording of extreme weather impacts around the world, improving the coverage of attribution studies across different events and regions, and using attribution studies to explore the contributions of both climate and non-climate drivers of impacts.",2022-06-28,2022,Ben Clarke; Friederike E.

W4308325267,Scientists' warning on climate change and insects,"Abstract Climate warming is considered to be among the most serious of anthropogenic stresses to the environment, because it not only has direct effects on biodiversity, but it also exacerbates the harmful effects of other human‐mediated threats. The associated consequences are potentially severe, particularly in terms of threats to species preservation, as well as in the preservation of an array of ecosystem services provided by biodiversity. Among the most affected groups of animals are insects—central components of many ecosystems—for which climate change has pervasive effects from individuals to communities. In this contribution to the scientists' warning series, we summarize the effect of the gradual global surface temperature increase on insects, in terms of physiology, behavior, phenology, distribution, and species interactions, as well as the effect of increased frequency and duration of extreme events such as hot and cold spells, fires, droughts, and floods on these parameters. We warn that, if no action is taken to better understand and reduce the action of climate change on insects, we will drastically reduce our ability to build a sustainable future based on healthy, functional ecosystems. We discuss perspectives on relevant ways to conserve insects in the face of climate change, and we offer several key recommendations on management approaches that can be adopted, on policies that should be pursued, and on the involvement of the general public in the protection effort.",2022-11-07,2022,Jeffrey A.

W3109809477,Indoor Exposure to Selected Air Pollutants in the Home Environment: A Systematic Review,"(1) Background: There is increasing awareness that the quality of the indoor environment affects our health and well-being. Indoor air quality (IAQ) in particular has an impact on multiple health outcomes, including respiratory and cardiovascular illness, allergic symptoms, cancers, and premature mortality. (2) Methods: We carried out a global systematic literature review on indoor exposure to selected air pollutants associated with adverse health effects, and related household characteristics, seasonal influences and occupancy patterns. We screened records from six bibliographic databases: ABI/INFORM, Environment Abstracts, Pollution Abstracts, PubMed, ProQuest Biological and Health Professional, and Scopus. (3) Results: Information on indoor exposure levels and determinants, emission sources, and associated health effects was extracted from 141 studies from 29 countries. The most-studied pollutants were particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10); nitrogen dioxide (NO2); volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including benzene, toluene, xylenes and formaldehyde; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) including naphthalene. Identified indoor PM2.5 sources include smoking, cooking, heating, use of incense, candles, and insecticides, while cleaning, housework, presence of pets and movement of people were the main sources of coarse particles. Outdoor air is a major PM2.5 source in rooms with natural ventilation in roadside households. Major sources of NO2 indoors are unvented gas heaters and cookers. Predictors of indoor NO2 are ventilation, season, and outdoor NO2 levels. VOCs are emitted from a wide range of indoor and outdoor sources, including smoking, solvent use, renovations, and household products. Formaldehyde levels are higher in newer houses and in the presence of new furniture, while PAH levels are higher in smoking households. High indoor particulate matter, NO2 and VOC levels were typically associated with respiratory symptoms, particularly asthma symptoms in children. (4) Conclusions: Household characteristics and occupant activities play a large role in indoor exposure, particularly cigarette smoking for PM2.5, gas appliances for NO2, and household products for VOCs and PAHs. Home location near high-traffic-density roads, redecoration, and small house size contribute to high indoor air pollution. In most studies, air exchange rates are negatively associated with indoor air pollution. These findings can inform interventions aiming to improve IAQ in residential properties in a variety of settings.",2020-12-02,2020,Sotiris Vardoulakis; Evanthia Giagloglou; Susanne Steinle; Alice Davis; Anne Sleeuwenhoek,Australian National University,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,403,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17238972,Energy_Sustainability,Indoor air quality; Environmental health; Environmental science; Incense; Pollutant,0.475
W3171366087,Perceived global increase in algal blooms is attributable to intensified monitoring and emerging bloom impacts,"Abstract Global trends in the occurrence, toxicity and risk posed by harmful algal blooms to natural systems, human health and coastal economies are poorly constrained, but are widely thought to be increasing due to climate change and nutrient pollution. Here, we conduct a statistical analysis on a global dataset extracted from the Harmful Algae Event Database and Ocean Biodiversity Information System for the period 1985–2018 to investigate temporal trends in the frequency and distribution of marine harmful algal blooms. We find no uniform global trend in the number of harmful algal events and their distribution over time, once data were adjusted for regional variations in monitoring effort. Varying and contrasting regional trends were driven by differences in bloom species, type and emergent impacts. Our findings suggest that intensified monitoring efforts associated with increased aquaculture production are responsible for the perceived increase in harmful algae events and that there is no empirical support for broad statements regarding increasing global trends. Instead, trends need to be considered regionally and at the species level.",2021-06-08,2021,Gustaaf M. Hallegraeff; Donald M.

W3175139132,Sampling biases shape our view of the natural world,"Spatial patterns of biodiversity are inextricably linked to their collection methods, yet no synthesis of bias patterns or their consequences exists. As such, views of organismal distribution and the ecosystems they make up may be incorrect, undermining countless ecological and evolutionary studies. Using 742 million records of 374 900 species, we explore the global patterns and impacts of biases related to taxonomy, accessibility, ecotype and data type across terrestrial and marine systems. Pervasive sampling and observation biases exist across animals, with only 6.74% of the globe sampled, and disproportionately poor tropical sampling. High elevations and deep seas are particularly unknown. Over 50% of records in most groups account for under 2% of species and citizen‐science only exacerbates biases. Additional data will be needed to overcome many of these biases, but we must increasingly value data publication to bridge this gap and better represent species' distributions from more distant and inaccessible areas, and provide the necessary basis for conservation and management.",2021-06-21,2021,Alice C.

W4226404303,Making sustainable aluminum by recycling scrap: The science of “dirty” alloys,"There are several facets of aluminum when it comes to sustainability. While it helps to save fuel due to its low density, producing it from ores is very energy-intensive. Recycling it shifts the balance towards higher sustainability, because the energy needed to melt aluminum from scrap is only about 5% of that consumed in ore reduction. The amount of aluminum available for recycling is estimated to double by 2050. This offers an opportunity to bring the metallurgical sector closer to a circular economy. A challenge is that large amounts of scrap are post-consumer scrap, containing high levels of elemental contamination. This has to be taken into account in more sustainable alloy design strategies. A “green aluminum” trend has already triggered a new trading platform for low-carbon aluminum at the London Metal Exchange (2020). The trend may lead to limits on the use of less-sustainable materials in future products. The shift from primary synthesis (ore reduction) to secondary synthesis (scrap melting) requires to gain better understanding of how multiple scrap-related contaminant elements act on aluminum alloys and how future alloys can be designed upfront to become scrap-compatible and composition-tolerant. The paper therefore discusses the influence of scrap-related impurities on the thermodynamics and kinetics of precipitation reactions and their mechanical and electrochemical effects; impurity effects on precipitation-free zones around grain boundaries; their effects on casting microstructures; and the possibilities presented by adjusting processing parameters and the associated mechanical, functional and chemical properties. The objective is to foster the design and production of aluminum alloys with the highest possible scrap fractions, using even low-quality scrap and scrap types which match only a few target alloys when recycled.",2022-04-07,2022,Dierk Raabe; Dirk Ponge; Peter J.

W4214866790,Climate Change Risks to Global Forest Health: Emergence of Unexpected Events of Elevated Tree Mortality Worldwide,"Recent observations of elevated tree mortality following climate extremes, like heat and drought, raise concerns about climate change risks to global forest health. We currently lack both sufficient data and understanding to identify whether these observations represent a global trend toward increasing tree mortality. Here, we document events of sudden and unexpected elevated tree mortality following heat and drought events in ecosystems that previously were considered tolerant or not at risk of exposure. These events underscore the fact that climate change may affect forests with unexpected force in the future. We use the events as examples to highlight current difficulties and challenges for realistically predicting such tree mortality events and the uncertainties about future forest condition. Advances in remote sensing technology and greater availably of high-resolution data, from both field assessments and from satellites, are needed to improve both understanding and prediction of forest responses to future climate change.

W3198097576,The MPA Guide: A framework to achieve global goals for the ocean,"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are conservation tools intended to protect biodiversity, promote healthy and resilient marine ecosystems, and provide societal benefits. Despite codification of MPAs in international agreements, MPA effectiveness is currently undermined by confusion about the many MPA types and consequent wildly differing outcomes. We present a clarifying science-driven framework—The MPA Guide—to aid design and evaluation. The guide categorizes MPAs by stage of establishment and level of protection, specifies the resulting direct and indirect outcomes for biodiversity and human well-being, and describes the key conditions necessary for positive outcomes. Use of this MPA Guide by scientists, managers, policy-makers, and communities can improve effective design, implementation, assessment, and tracking of existing and future MPAs to achieve conservation goals by using scientifically grounded practices.",2021-09-09,2021,Kirsten Grorud‐Colvert; Jenna Sullivan‐Stack; Callum M.

W4287854497,On the History and Future of 100% Renewable Energy Systems Research,"Research on 100% renewable energy systems is a relatively recent phenomenon. It was initiated in the mid-1970s, catalyzed by skyrocketing oil prices. Since the mid-2000s, it has quickly evolved into a prominent research field encompassing an expansive and growing number of research groups and organizations across the world. The main conclusion of most of these studies is that 100% renewables is feasible worldwide at low cost. Advanced concepts and methods now enable the field to chart realistic as well as cost- or resource-optimized and efficient transition pathways to a future without the use of fossil fuels. Such proposed pathways in turn, have helped spur 100% renewable energy policy targets and actions, leading to more research. In most transition pathways, solar energy and wind power increasingly emerge as the central pillars of a sustainable energy system combined with energy efficiency measures. Cost-optimization modeling and greater resource availability tend to lead to higher solar photovoltaic shares, while emphasis on energy supply diversification tends to point to higher wind power contributions. Recent research has focused on the challenges and opportunities regarding grid congestion, energy storage, sector coupling, electrification of transport and industry implying power-to-X and hydrogen-to-X, and the inclusion of natural and technical carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches. The result is a holistic vision of the transition towards a net-negative greenhouse gas emissions economy that can limit global warming to 1.5°C with a clearly defined carbon budget in a sustainable and cost-effective manner based on 100% renewable energy-industry-CDR systems. Initially, the field encountered very strong skepticism. Therefore, this paper also includes a response to major critiques against 100% renewable energy systems, and also discusses the institutional inertia that hampers adoption by the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as well as possible negative connections to community acceptance and energy justice. We conclude by discussing how this emergent research field can further progress to the benefit of society.",2022-01-01,2022,Christian Breyer; Siavash Khalili; Dmitrii Bogdanov; Manish Ram; Ayobami Solomon Oyewo,University of Technology Sydney,IEEE Access,377,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2022.3193402,Energy_Sustainability,Renewable energy; Environmental economics; Electrification; Energy transition; Fossil fuel,0.625
W3020870178,Towards a unified study of multiple stressors: divisions and common goals across research disciplines,"Anthropogenic environmental changes, or ‘stressors’, increasingly threaten biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide. Multiple-stressor research is a rapidly expanding field of science that seeks to understand and ultimately predict the interactions between stressors. Reviews and meta-analyses of the primary scientific literature have largely been specific to either freshwater, marine or terrestrial ecology, or ecotoxicology. In this cross-disciplinary study, we review the state of knowledge within and among these disciplines to highlight commonality and division in multiple-stressor research. Our review goes beyond a description of previous research by using quantitative bibliometric analysis to identify the division between disciplines and link previously disconnected research communities. Towards a unified research framework, we discuss the shared goal of increased realism through both ecological and temporal complexity, with the overarching aim of improving predictive power. In a rapidly changing world, advancing our understanding of the cumulative ecological impacts of multiple stressors is critical for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. Identifying and overcoming the barriers to interdisciplinary knowledge exchange is necessary in rising to this challenge. Division between ecosystem types and disciplines is largely a human creation. Species and stressors cross these borders and so should the scientists who study them.",2020-05-06,2020,James Orr; Rolf D. Vinebrooke; Michelle C. Jackson; Kristy J. Kroeker; Rebecca L.

Saintilan et al. investigated the likely effects of this increasing rate of rise on coastal mangrove forest, a tropical ecosystem of key importance for coastal protection (see the Perspective by Lovelock). They reviewed data on mangrove accretion 10,000 to 7000 years before present, when the rate of sea level rise was even higher than today as a result of glacial ice melt. Their analysis suggests an upper threshold of 7 millimeters per year as the maximum rate of sea level rise associated with mangrove vertical development, beyond which the ecosystem fails to keep up with the change. Under projected rates of sea level rise, they predict that a deficit between accretion and sea level rise is likely to commence in the next 30 years.

W4200363055,"Recent advances in carbon dioxide geological storage, experimental procedures, influencing parameters, and future outlook","The oxidation of fossil fuels produces billions of tons of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from stationary and nonstationary sources per annum, contributing to global warming. The natural carbon cycle consumes a portion of CO2 emissions from the atmosphere. In contrast, substantial CO2 emissions accumulate, making it the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and causing a rise in the planet's temperature. The Earth's temperature was estimated to be 1 °C higher in 2017 compared to the mid-twentieth century. A solution to this problem is CO2 storage in underground formations, abundant throughout the world. Millions of tons of CO2 are stored underground into geological formations annually, including deep saline aquifers. However, these geological formations have minute concentrations of organic material, significantly influencing the CO2 containment security, fluid dynamics, and storage potential. Examining the wetting characteristics and influencing parameters of geological formations is pertinent to understanding the supercritical CO2 behavior in rock/brine systems. Wettability is an important parameter governing the ability of injected CO2 to displace formation water and determine the containment security and storage capacity. Previously, many studies have provided comprehensive overviews of CO2-wettability depending on various factors, such as pressure, temperature, salinity, formation type, surfactants, and chemicals. However, mineral surfaces in these wettability studies are chemically cleaned, and natural geological storage conditions are anoxic (containing organic molecules) where reductive conditions ensue. A severe gap exists in the literature to comprehend the effects of organic material for determining the CO2 storage capacities and how this effect can be reversed using nanomaterial for increased CO2 storage potential. Therefore, we conducted a thorough literature review to comprehend the recent advances in rock/CO2/brine and rock/oil/brine systems containing organic material in different geo-storage formations. We also present recent advances in anoxic rock/CO2/brine and rock/oil/brine systems that have employed nanomaterial for wettability reversal to be more water-wet. This comprehensive review is divided into four parts: 1) reviewing CO2 emissions and geological systems, 2) recent advances in direct quantitative experimental procedures in anoxic rock/CO2/brine systems and effects of organic contaminations on experimental methodology and their controls, 3) effects of organics and nanomaterial in rock/CO2/brine and rock/oil/brine systems, and 4) the future outlook of this study.",2021-12-14,2021,Muhammad Ali; Nilesh Kumar Jha; Nilanjan Pal; Alireza Keshavarz; Hussein Hoteit,Curtin University,Earth-Science Reviews,351,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103895,Energy_Sustainability,Greenhouse gas; Environmental science; Carbon dioxide; Caprock; Carbon sequestration,0.7
W3127840153,Agriculture's Contribution to Climate Change and Role in Mitigation Is Distinct From Predominantly Fossil CO2-Emitting Sectors,"Agriculture is a significant contributor to anthropogenic global warming, and reducing agricultural emissions-largely methane and nitrous oxide-could play a significant role in climate change mitigation. However, there are important differences between carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a stock pollutant, and methane (CH4), which is predominantly a flow pollutant. These dynamics mean that conventional reporting of aggregated CO2-equivalent emission rates is highly ambiguous and does not straightforwardly reflect historical or anticipated contributions to global temperature change. As a result, the roles and responsibilities of different sectors emitting different gases are similarly obscured by the common means of communicating emission reduction scenarios using CO2-equivalence. We argue for a shift in how we report agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and think about their mitigation to better reflect the distinct roles of different greenhouse gases. Policy-makers, stakeholders, and society at large should also be reminded that the role of agriculture in climate mitigation is a much broader topic than climate science alone can inform, including considerations of economic and technical feasibility, preferences for food supply and land-use, and notions of fairness and justice. A more nuanced perspective on the impacts of different emissions could aid these conversations.",2021-02-03,2021,John Lynch; Michelle Cain; David J. Frame; Raymond T.

W3126197870,All‐Cold Evaporation under One Sun with Zero Energy Loss by Using a Heatsink Inspired Solar Evaporator,"Interfacial solar steam generation is a highly efficient and sustainable technology for clean water production and wastewater treatment. Although great progress has been achieved in improving evaporation rate and energy efficiency, it's still challenging to fully eliminate the energy loss to the surrounding environment during solar steam generation. To achieve this, a novel heatsink-like evaporator (HSE) is developed herein. During solar evaporation, the temperature on the top solar evaporation surface can be regulated by the fin structures of the HSE. For the evaporators with 5 to 7 heatsink fins, the temperature of the solar evaporation surface is decreased to be lower than the ambient temperature, which fully eliminates the radiation, convection, and conduction heat losses, leading to the absolute cold evaporation over the entire evaporator under 1.0 sun irradiation. As a result, massive energy (4.26 W), which is over 170% of the received light energy, is harvested from the environment due to the temperature deficit, significantly enhancing the energy efficiency of solar steam generation. An extremely high evaporation rate of 4.10 kg m-2 h-1 is realized with a 6-fin photothermal HSE, corresponding to an energy conversion efficiency far beyond the theoretical limit, assuming 100% light-to-vapor energy conversion.",2021-02-08,2021,Xuan Wu; Zhiqing Wu; Yida Wang; Ting Gao; Qin Li,University of South Australia,Advanced Science,340,https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202002501,Energy_Sustainability,Evaporator; Evaporation; Materials science; Solar energy; Thermodynamics,0.625
W3131956693,Demand-side solutions to climate change mitigation consistent with high levels of well-being,"Mitigation solutions are often evaluated in terms of costs and greenhouse gas reduction potentials, missing out on the consideration of direct effects on human well-being. Here, we systematically assess the mitigation potential of demand-side options categorized into avoid, shift and improve, and their human well-being links. We show that these options, bridging socio-behavioural, infrastructural and technological domains, can reduce counterfactual sectoral emissions by 40–80% in end-use sectors. Based on expert judgement and an extensive literature database, we evaluate 306 combinations of well-being outcomes and demand-side options, finding largely beneficial effects in improvement in well-being (79% positive, 18% neutral and 3% negative), even though we find low confidence on the social dimensions of well-being. Implementing such nuanced solutions is based axiomatically on an understanding of malleable rather than fixed preferences, and procedurally on changing infrastructures and choice architectures. Results demonstrate the high mitigation potential of demand-side mitigation options that are synergistic with well-being.",2021-11-25,2021,Felix Creutzig; Leila Niamir; Xuemei Bai; Max Callaghan; Jonathan M.

W4291904039,"Global food insecurity and famine from reduced crop, marine fishery and livestock production due to climate disruption from nuclear war soot injection","Atmospheric soot loadings from nuclear weapon detonation would cause disruptions to the Earth's climate, limiting terrestrial and aquatic food production. Here, we use climate, crop and fishery models to estimate the impacts arising from six scenarios of stratospheric soot injection, predicting the total food calories available in each nation post-war after stored food is consumed. In quantifying impacts away from target areas, we demonstrate that soot injections larger than 5 Tg would lead to mass food shortages, and livestock and aquatic food production would be unable to compensate for reduced crop output, in almost all countries. Adaptation measures such as food waste reduction would have limited impact on increasing available calories. We estimate more than 2 billion people could die from nuclear war between India and Pakistan, and more than 5 billion could die from a war between the United States and Russia-underlining the importance of global cooperation in preventing nuclear war.",2022-08-15,2022,Lili Xia; Alan Robock; Kim Scherrer; Cheryl S.

W3098322373,IceCube high-energy starting event sample: Description and flux characterization with 7.5 years of data,"The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has established the existence of a high-energy all-sky neutrino flux of astrophysical origin. This discovery was made using events interacting within a fiducial region of the detector surrounded by an active veto and with reconstructed energy above 60 TeV, commonly known as the high-energy starting event sample (HESE). We revisit the analysis of the HESE sample with an additional 4.5 years of data, newer glacial ice models, and improved systematics treatment. This paper describes the sample in detail, reports on the latest astrophysical neutrino flux measurements, and presents a source search for astrophysical neutrinos. We give the compatibility of these observations with specific isotropic flux models proposed in the literature as well as generic power-law-like scenarios. Assuming v(e): v(mu): v(tau) = 1:1:1, and an equal flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos, we find that the astrophysical neutrino spectrum is compatible with an unbroken power law, with a preferred spectral index of 2.87(-0.19)(+0.20) for the 68% confidence interval.",2021-07-08,2021,Rasha Abbasi; M.

W3134408425,A review of pumped hydro energy storage,"Abstract The need for storage in electricity systems is increasing because large amounts of variable solar and wind generation capacity are being deployed. About two thirds of net global annual power capacity additions are solar and wind. Pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) comprises about 96% of global storage power capacity and 99% of global storage energy volume. Batteries occupy most of the balance of the electricity storage market including utility, home and electric vehicle batteries. Batteries are rapidly falling in price and can compete with pumped hydro for short-term storage (minutes to hours). However, pumped hydro continues to be much cheaper for large-scale energy storage (several hours to weeks). Most existing pumped hydro storage is river-based in conjunction with hydroelectric generation. Water can be pumped from a lower to an upper reservoir during times of low demand and the stored energy can be recovered at a later time. In the future, the vast storage opportunities available in closed loop off-river pumped hydro systems will be utilized. In such systems water is cycled repeatedly between two closely spaced small reservoirs located away from a river. This review covers the technology, cost, environmental impacts and opportunities for PHES. The key motivations for this review are firstly that large amounts of variable wind and solar generators are being deployed; and secondly that there are vast opportunities for low-cost pumped hydro storage that do not require interference with rivers (with the associated environmental cost).",2021-03-02,2021,Andrew Blakers; Matthew Stocks; Bin Lü; Cheng Cheng,Australian National University,Progress in Energy,319,https://doi.org/10.1088/2516-1083/abeb5b,Energy_Sustainability,Energy storage; Pumped-storage hydroelectricity; Environmental science; Nuclear engineering; Physics,0.7

This review aims to share the knowledge and engage with a broader readership about the current progress of ISSG technology and the facing challenges to promote further advancements toward practical applications. The first part of this review assesses the current strategies for enhancing the energy efficiency of ISSG systems, including optimizing light absorption, reducing energy losses, harvesting additional energy, and lowering evaporation enthalpy. Subsequently, the current challenges faced by ISSG technologies, notably salt accumulation and bio‐fouling issues in practical applications, are elucidated and contemporary methods are discussed to overcome these challenges. In the end, potential applications of ISSG, ranging from initial seawater desalination and industrial wastewater purification to power generation, sterilization, soil remediation, and innovative concept of solar sea farm, are introduced, highlighting the promising potential of ISSG technology in contributing to sustainable and environmentally conscious practices.

W2916674581,The 2023 terahertz science and technology roadmap,"Terahertz (THz) radiation encompasses a wide spectral range within the electromagnetic spectrum that extends from microwaves to the far infrared (100 GHz-∼30 THz). Within its frequency boundaries exist a broad variety of scientific disciplines that have presented, and continue to present, technical challenges to researchers. During the past 50 years, for instance, the demands of the scientific community have substantially evolved and with a need for advanced instrumentation to support radio astronomy, Earth observation, weather forecasting, security imaging, telecommunications, non-destructive device testing and much more. Furthermore, applications have required an emergence of technology from the laboratory environment to production-scale supply and in-the-field deployments ranging from harsh ground-based locations to deep space. In addressing these requirements, the research and development community has advanced related technology and bridged the transition between electronics and photonics that high frequency operation demands. The multidisciplinary nature of THz work was our stimulus for creating the 2017 THz Science and Technology Roadmap (Dhillon et al 2017 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 50 043001). As one might envisage, though, there remains much to explore both scientifically and technically and the field has continued to develop and expand rapidly. It is timely, therefore, to revise our previous roadmap and in this 2023 version we both provide an update on key developments in established technical areas that have important scientific and public benefit, and highlight new and emerging areas that show particular promise. The developments that we describe thus span from fundamental scientific research, such as THz astronomy and the emergent area of THz quantum optics, to highly applied and commercially and societally impactful subjects that include 6G THz communications, medical imaging, and climate monitoring and prediction. Our Roadmap vision draws upon the expertise and perspective of multiple international specialists that together provide an overview of past developments and the likely challenges facing the field of THz science and technology in future decades. The document is written in a form that is accessible to policy makers who wish to gain an overview of the current state of the THz art, and for the non-specialist and curious who wish to understand available technology and challenges. A such, our experts deliver a ‘snapshot’ introduction to the current status of the field and provide suggestions for exciting future technical development directions. Ultimately, we intend the Roadmap to portray the advantages and benefits of the THz domain and to stimulate further exploration of the field in support of scientific research and commercial realisation.",2023-02-23,2023,Alfred Leitenstorfer; A.

W3002782576,The future sea-level contribution of the Greenland ice sheet: a multi-model ensemble study of ISMIP6,"Abstract. The Greenland ice sheet is one of the largest contributors to global mean sea-level rise today and is expected to continue to lose mass as the Arctic continues to warm. The two predominant mass loss mechanisms are increased surface meltwater run-off and mass loss associated with the retreat of marine-terminating outlet glaciers. In this paper we use a large ensemble of Greenland ice sheet models forced by output from a representative subset of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) global climate models to project ice sheet changes and sea-level rise contributions over the 21st century. The simulations are part of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6). We estimate the sea-level contribution together with uncertainties due to future climate forcing, ice sheet model formulations and ocean forcing for the two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios RCP8.5 and RCP2.6. The results indicate that the Greenland ice sheet will continue to lose mass in both scenarios until 2100, with contributions of 90±50 and 32±17 mm to sea-level rise for RCP8.5 and RCP2.6, respectively. The largest mass loss is expected from the south-west of Greenland, which is governed by surface mass balance changes, continuing what is already observed today. Because the contributions are calculated against an unforced control experiment, these numbers do not include any committed mass loss, i.e. mass loss that would occur over the coming century if the climate forcing remained constant. Under RCP8.5 forcing, ice sheet model uncertainty explains an ensemble spread of 40 mm, while climate model uncertainty and ocean forcing uncertainty account for a spread of 36 and 19 mm, respectively. Apart from those formally derived uncertainty ranges, the largest gap in our knowledge is about the physical understanding and implementation of the calving process, i.e. the interaction of the ice sheet with the ocean.",2020-09-17,2020,Heiko Goelzer; Sophie Nowicki; A.

W3083704968,Heat stored in the Earth system: where does the energy go?,"Abstract. Human-induced atmospheric composition changes cause a radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere which is driving global warming. This Earth energy imbalance (EEI) is the most critical number defining the prospects for continued global warming and climate change. Understanding the heat gain of the Earth system – and particularly how much and where the heat is distributed – is fundamental to understanding how this affects warming ocean, atmosphere and land; rising surface temperature; sea level; and loss of grounded and floating ice, which are fundamental concerns for society. This study is a Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) concerted international effort to update the Earth heat inventory and presents an updated assessment of ocean warming estimates as well as new and updated estimates of heat gain in the atmosphere, cryosphere and land over the period 1960–2018. The study obtains a consistent long-term Earth system heat gain over the period 1971–2018, with a total heat gain of 358±37 ZJ, which is equivalent to a global heating rate of 0.47±0.1 W m−2. Over the period 1971–2018 (2010–2018), the majority of heat gain is reported for the global ocean with 89 % (90 %), with 52 % for both periods in the upper 700 m depth, 28 % (30 %) for the 700–2000 m depth layer and 9 % (8 %) below 2000 m depth. Heat gain over land amounts to 6 % (5 %) over these periods, 4 % (3 %) is available for the melting of grounded and floating ice, and 1 % (2 %) is available for atmospheric warming. Our results also show that EEI is not only continuing, but also increasing: the EEI amounts to 0.87±0.12 W m−2 during 2010–2018. Stabilization of climate, the goal of the universally agreed United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992 and the Paris Agreement in 2015, requires that EEI be reduced to approximately zero to achieve Earth's system quasi-equilibrium. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere would need to be reduced from 410 to 353 ppm to increase heat radiation to space by 0.87 W m−2, bringing Earth back towards energy balance. This simple number, EEI, is the most fundamental metric that the scientific community and public must be aware of as the measure of how well the world is doing in the task of bringing climate change under control, and we call for an implementation of the EEI into the global stocktake based on best available science. Continued quantification and reduced uncertainties in the Earth heat inventory can be best achieved through the maintenance of the current global climate observing system, its extension into areas of gaps in the sampling, and the establishment of an international framework for concerted multidisciplinary research of the Earth heat inventory as presented in this study. This Earth heat inventory is published at the German Climate Computing Centre (DKRZ, https://www.dkrz.de/, last access: 7 August 2020) under the DOI https://doi.org/10.26050/WDCC/GCOS_EHI_EXP_v2 (von Schuckmann et al., 2020).",2020-09-07,2020,Karina von Schuckmann; Lijing Cheng; Matthew D.

W3113047742,Hydrogen Wettability of Sandstone Reservoirs: Implications for Hydrogen Geo‐Storage,"Abstract Hydrogen is currently assessed as a future clean fuel in a hydrogen economy. However, one key problem with implementing a full‐scale hydrogen economy is hydrogen storage (as hydrogen is highly compressible and volatile). One solution for this problem is hydrogen geo‐storage, where compressed hydrogen is injected into geological formations, and the hydrogen can be withdrawn again at any time. However, there is a serious lack of data for realistic geologic conditions, including for hydrogen‐rock wettability, which is proven to determine injectivities, withdrawal rates, storage capacities, and containment security. We thus measured this parameter at various geo‐storage conditions. For a realistic storage scenario in a deep sandstone aquifer, we found that the rock (quartz) was weakly water‐wet or intermediate‐wet. Increasing pressure, temperature, and organic surface concentration increased hydrogen wettability. This study, thus, provides fundamental data and aids in the industrial‐scale implementation of a future hydrogen economy.",2020-12-12,2020,Stefan Iglauer; Muhammad Ali; Alireza Keshavarz,Edith Cowan University,Geophysical Research Letters,314,https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gl090814,Energy_Sustainability,Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Compressed hydrogen; Environmental science; Wetting,0.492
W3009355673,The global distribution of seagrass meadows,"Abstract Seagrass meadows globally are under pressure with worldwide loss and degradation, but there is a growing recognition of the global importance of seagrass ecosystem services, particularly as a major carbon sink and as fisheries habitat. Estimates of global seagrass spatial distribution differ greatly throughout the published literature, ranging from 177 000 to 600 000 km 2 with models suggesting potential distribution an order of magnitude higher. The requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement by outlining National Determined Contributions (NDC’s) to reduce emissions is placing an increased global focus on the spatial extent, loss and restoration of seagrass meadows. Now more than ever there is a need to provide a more accurate and consistent measure of the global spatial distribution of seagrass. There is also a need to be able to assess the global spread of other seagrass ecosystem services and in their extension, the values of these services. In this study, by rationalising and updating a range of existing datasets of seagrass distribution around the globe, we have estimated with Moderate to High confidence the global seagrass area to date as 160 387 km 2 , but possibly 266 562 km 2 with lower confidence. We break this global estimate down to a national level with a detailed analysis of the current state of mapped distribution and estimates of seagrass area per country. Accurate estimates, however, are challenged by large areas remaining unmapped and inconsistent measures being used. Through the examination of current global maps, we are able to propose a pathway forward for improving mapping of this important resource.

W3005043841,Solutions for humanity on how to conserve insects,"The fate of humans and insects intertwine, especially through the medium of plants. Global environmental change, including land transformation and contamination, is causing concerning insect diversity loss, articulated in the companion review Scientists' warning to humanity on insect extinctions. Yet, despite a sound philosophical foundation, recognized ethical values, and scientific evidence, globally we are performing poorly at instigating effective insect conservation. As insects are a major component of the tapestry of life, insect conservation would do well to integrate better with overall biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. This also involves popularizing insects, especially through use of iconic species, through more media coverage, and more inclusive education. Insect conservationists need to liaise better with decision makers, stakeholders, and land managers, especially at the conceptually familiar scale of the landscape. Enough evidence is now available, and synthesized here, which illustrates that multiple strategies work at local levels towards saving insects. We now need to expand these locally-crafted strategies globally. Tangible actions include ensuring maintenance of biotic complexity, especially through improving temporal and spatial heterogeneity, functional connectivity, and metapopulation dynamics, while maintaining unique habitats, across landscape mosaics, as well as instigating better communication. Key is to have more expansive sustainable agriculture and forestry, improved regulation and prevention of environmental risks, and greater recognition of protected areas alongside agro-ecology in novel landscapes. Future-proofing insect diversity is now critical, with the benefits far reaching, including continued provision of valuable ecosystem services and the conservation of a rich and impressive component of Earth's biodiversity.",2020-02-01,2020,Michael J.

Zeolites have versatile applications such as environmental remediation, catalytic activity, biotechnological application, gas sensing and medicinal applications. Although, naturally occurring zeolites are readily available, nowadays, more emphasis is given on the synthesis of the zeolites due to their easy synthesis in the pure form, better ion exchange capabilities and uniform in size. Recently, much attention has also been paid on how zeolite is being synthesized from low-cost material (e.g., rice husk), particularly, by resolving the major environmental issues. Hence, the main purpose of this review is to make an effective resolution of zeolite synthesis methods together with potential applications in environmental engineering. Among different synthesis methods, hydrothermal method is commonly found to be used widely in the synthesis of various zeolites from inexpensive raw materials such as fly ash, rice husk ash, blast furnace slag, municipal solid waste, paper sludge, lithium slag and kaolin.

W3112344741,Global blue carbon accumulation in tidal wetlands increases with climate change,"Coastal tidal wetlands produce and accumulate significant amounts of organic carbon (C) that help to mitigate climate change. However, previous data limitations have prevented a robust evaluation of the global rates and mechanisms driving C accumulation. Here, we go beyond recent soil C stock estimates to reveal global tidal wetland C accumulation and predict changes under relative sea level rise, temperature and precipitation. We use data from literature study sites and our new observations spanning wide latitudinal gradients and 20 countries. Globally, tidal wetlands accumulate 53.65 (95%CI: 48.52-59.01) Tg C yr-1, which is ∼30% of the organic C buried on the ocean floor. Modeling based on current climatic drivers and under projected emissions scenarios revealed a net increase in the global C accumulation by 2100. This rapid increase is driven by sea level rise in tidal marshes, and higher temperature and precipitation in mangroves. Countries with large areas of coastal wetlands, like Indonesia and Mexico, are more susceptible to tidal wetland C losses under climate change, while regions such as Australia, Brazil, the USA and China will experience a significant C accumulation increase under all projected scenarios.",2020-12-12,2020,Faming Wang; Christian J.

W3027237079,Evaluation of 18 satellite- and model-based soil moisture products using in situ measurements from 826 sensors,"Abstract. Information about the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture is critical for many purposes, including monitoring of hydrologic extremes, irrigation scheduling, and prediction of agricultural yields. We evaluated the temporal dynamics of 18 state-of-the-art (quasi-)global near-surface soil moisture products, including six based on satellite retrievals, six based on models without satellite data assimilation (referred to hereafter as “open-loop” models), and six based on models that assimilate satellite soil moisture or brightness temperature data. Seven of the products are introduced for the first time in this study: one multi-sensor merged satellite product called MeMo (Merged soil Moisture) and six estimates from the HBV (Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning) model with three precipitation inputs (ERA5, IMERG, and MSWEP) with and without assimilation of SMAPL3E satellite retrievals, respectively. As reference, we used in situ soil moisture measurements between 2015 and 2019 at 5 cm depth from 826 sensors, located primarily in the USA and Europe. The 3-hourly Pearson correlation (R) was chosen as the primary performance metric. We found that application of the Soil Wetness Index (SWI) smoothing filter resulted in improved performance for all satellite products. The best-to-worst performance ranking of the four single-sensor satellite products was SMAPL3ESWI, SMOSSWI, AMSR2SWI, and ASCATSWI, with the L-band-based SMAPL3ESWI (median R of 0.72) outperforming the others at 50 % of the sites. Among the two multi-sensor satellite products (MeMo and ESA-CCISWI), MeMo performed better on average (median R of 0.72 versus 0.67), probably due to the inclusion of SMAPL3ESWI. The best-to-worst performance ranking of the six open-loop models was HBV-MSWEP, HBV-ERA5, ERA5-Land, HBV-IMERG, VIC-PGF, and GLDAS-Noah. This ranking largely reflects the quality of the precipitation forcing. HBV-MSWEP (median R of 0.78) performed best not just among the open-loop models but among all products. The calibration of HBV improved the median R by +0.12 on average compared to random parameters, highlighting the importance of model calibration. The best-to-worst performance ranking of the six models with satellite data assimilation was HBV-MSWEP+SMAPL3E, HBV-ERA5+SMAPL3E, GLEAM, SMAPL4, HBV-IMERG+SMAPL3E, and ERA5. The assimilation of SMAPL3E retrievals into HBV-IMERG improved the median R by +0.06, suggesting that data assimilation yields significant benefits at the global scale.",2021-01-04,2021,Hylke E.

W3137764081,State-of-the-art of renewable energy sources used in water desalination: Present and future prospects,"The last decade has seen a worldwide increase in the use of alternative energy sources, especially renewable energy (RE), including its application in desalination. In the past many experimental and pilot investigations were presented which allowed the costs and effectiveness of such integrated solutions to be estimated. The present review describes experience related to the use of solar thermal technologies (solar collector and concentrated solar power technologies), solar electricity (photovoltaic and concentrator photovoltaics), wind, hydroelectric (hydropower, tidal, wave and ocean thermal energy), biomass and geothermal energy (power and thermal) as well as hybrid systems. The costs relating to energy and desalinated water production are investigated in the case of various technological processes used in desalination. The main directions for development of the RE systems investigated are discussed and their advantages and disadvantages are assessed. Such a comprehensive review showed that the expansion of the effective use of RE sources is still hampered by several techno-economic aspects. The paper focuses on the main concerns of the need to optimise energy processes, especially by creating more energy-efficient and economically effective solutions, energy storage, energy recovery and the expansion of off-grid systems. As a result of the analysis it was concluded that, despite some disadvantages, the combining of RE with desalination processes requires further intensive research and demonstration units for longer term performance. Regulations to develop less energy-intensive desalination technologies are also still needed.",2021-03-16,2021,Jochen Bundschuh; Michał Kaczmarczyk; Noreddine Ghaffour; Barbara Tomaszewska,University of Southern Queensland,Desalination,283,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2021.115035,Energy_Sustainability,Renewable energy; Desalination; Environmental science; Solar energy; Photovoltaic system,0.85
W3121656225,"PFAS and their substitutes in groundwater: Occurrence, transformation and remediation","Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are increasingly investigated due to their global occurrence and potential human health risk. The ban on PFOA and PFOS has led to the use of novel substitutes such as GenX, F-53B and OBS. This paper reviews the studies on the occurrence, transformation and remediation of major PFAS i.e. PFOA, PFNA, PFBA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFBS and the three substitutes in groundwater. The data indicated that PFOA, PFBA, PFOS and PFBS were present at high concentrations up to 21,200 ng L−1 while GenX and F-53B were found up to 30,000 ng L−1 and 0.18–0.59 ng L−1, respectively. PFAS in groundwater are from direct sources e.g. surface water and soil. PFAS remediation methods based on membrane, redox, sorption, electrochemical and photocatalysis are analyzed. Overall, photocatalysis is considered to be an ideal technology with low cost and high degradation efficacy for PFAS removal. Photocatalysis could be combined with electrochemical or membrane filtration to become more advantageous. GenX, F-53B and OBS in groundwater treatment by UV/sulfite system and electrochemical oxidation proved effective. The review identified gaps such as the immobilization and recycling of materials in groundwater treatment, and recommended visible light photocatalysis for future studies.",2021-01-23,2021,Bentuo Xu; Shuai Liu; John L.

W4213274904,Atmospheric dryness reduces photosynthesis along a large range of soil water deficits,"Both low soil water content (SWC) and high atmospheric dryness (vapor pressure deficit, VPD) can negatively affect terrestrial gross primary production (GPP). The sensitivity of GPP to soil versus atmospheric dryness is difficult to disentangle, however, because of their covariation. Using global eddy-covariance observations, here we show that a decrease in SWC is not universally associated with GPP reduction. GPP increases in response to decreasing SWC when SWC is high and decreases only when SWC is below a threshold. By contrast, the sensitivity of GPP to an increase of VPD is always negative across the full SWC range. We further find canopy conductance decreases with increasing VPD (irrespective of SWC), and with decreasing SWC on drier soils. Maximum photosynthetic assimilation rate has negative sensitivity to VPD, and a positive sensitivity to decreasing SWC when SWC is high. Earth System Models underestimate the negative effect of VPD and the positive effect of SWC on GPP such that they should underestimate the GPP reduction due to increasing VPD in future climates.",2022-02-21,2022,Zheng Fu; Philippe Ciais; I.

W3034446243,An overview of the ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) project: aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions in the southeast Atlantic basin,"Abstract. Southern Africa produces almost a third of the Earth's biomass burning (BB) aerosol particles, yet the fate of these particles and their influence on regional and global climate is poorly understood. ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) is a 5-year NASA EVS-2 (Earth Venture Suborbital-2) investigation with three intensive observation periods designed to study key atmospheric processes that determine the climate impacts of these aerosols. During the Southern Hemisphere winter and spring (June–October), aerosol particles reaching 3–5 km in altitude are transported westward over the southeast Atlantic, where they interact with one of the largest subtropical stratocumulus (Sc) cloud decks in the world. The representation of these interactions in climate models remains highly uncertain in part due to a scarcity of observational constraints on aerosol and cloud properties, as well as due to the parameterized treatment of physical processes. Three ORACLES deployments by the NASA P-3 aircraft in September 2016, August 2017, and October 2018 (totaling ∼350 science flight hours), augmented by the deployment of the NASA ER-2 aircraft for remote sensing in September 2016 (totaling ∼100 science flight hours), were intended to help fill this observational gap. ORACLES focuses on three fundamental science themes centered on the climate effects of African BB aerosols: (a) direct aerosol radiative effects, (b) effects of aerosol absorption on atmospheric circulation and clouds, and (c) aerosol–cloud microphysical interactions. This paper summarizes the ORACLES science objectives, describes the project implementation, provides an overview of the flights and measurements in each deployment, and highlights the integrative modeling efforts from cloud to global scales to address science objectives. Significant new findings on the vertical structure of BB aerosol physical and chemical properties, chemical aging, cloud condensation nuclei, rain and precipitation statistics, and aerosol indirect effects are emphasized, but their detailed descriptions are the subject of separate publications. The main purpose of this paper is to familiarize the broader scientific community with the ORACLES project and the dataset it produced.",2021-02-04,2021,Jens Redemann; Robert Wood; Paquita Zuidema; Sarah J.

W3002104370,Total ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves across broad global environmental and physical gradients,"Abstract Mangroves sequester large quantities of carbon (C) that become significant sources of greenhouse gases when disturbed through land‐use change. Thus, they are of great value to incorporate into climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. In response, a global network of mangrove plots was established to provide policy‐relevant ecological data relating to interactions of mangrove C stocks with climatic, tidal, plant community, and geomorphic factors. Mangroves from 190 sites were sampled across five continents encompassing large biological, physical, and climatic gradients using consistent methodologies for the quantification of total ecosystem C stocks (TECS). Carbon stock data were collected along with vegetation, physical, and climatic data to explore potential predictive relationships. There was a 28‐fold range in TECS (79–2,208 Mg C/ha) with a mean of 856 ± 32 Mg C/ha. Belowground C comprised an average 85% of the TECS. Mean soil depth was 216 cm, ranging from 22 to &gt;300 cm, with 68 sites (35%) exceeding a depth of 300 cm. TECS were weakly correlated with metrics of forest structure, suggesting that aboveground forest structure alone cannot accurately predict TECS. Similarly, precipitation was not a strong predictor of TECS. Reasonable estimates of TECS were derived via multiple regression analysis using precipitation, soil depth, tree mass, and latitude ( R 2 = 0.54) as variables. Soil carbon to a 1 m depth averaged 44% of the TECS. Limiting analyses of soil C stocks to the top 1 m of soils result in large underestimates of TECS as well as in the greenhouse gas emissions that would arise from their conversion to other land uses. The current IPCC Tier 1 default TECS value for mangroves is 511 Mg C/ha, which is only 60% of our calculated global mean. This study improves current assessments of mangrove C stocks providing a foundation necessary for C valuation related to climate change mitigation. We estimate mangroves globally store about 11.7 Pg C: an aboveground carbon stock of 1.6 Pg C and a belowground carbon stock of 10.2 Pg C). The differences in the estimates of total ecosystem carbon stocks based on climate, salinity, forest structure, geomorphology, or geopolitical boundaries are not as much of an influence as the choice of soil depth included in the estimate. Choosing to limit soils to a 1 m depth resulted in estimates of &lt;5 Pg whereas those that included the soil profile &gt;1 m depth resulted in global carbon stock estimates that exceeded 11.2 Pg C.",2020-01-24,2020,J.

W3110748295,Recent progress in recycling carbon fibre reinforced composites and dry carbon fibre wastes,"Carbon fibre reinforced composites (CFRC) continue to play a key role in the growth and development of many weight sensitive industries. However, their proliferation has raised increasing concerns regarding the required practices and strategies to deal with these expensive engineered structures at the end of their life cycle. This has brought into focus the need to develop more sustainable and efficient recycling solutions for these products. Similarly, the necessity of managing dry carbon fibre scraps generated during the manufacturing process of CFRC has attracted more attention in recent years. This review article provides an overview on recent advances in recycling CFRC as well as processing dry carbon fibre scraps. Influential parameters, advantages, drawbacks, and possible environmental impacts of the main technologies of processing CFRC waste including mechanical, thermal (pyrolysis and fluidised bed), and chemical (solvolysis and low temperature chemical processing) will be evaluated. Their potential effects on mechanical characteristics and surface chemistry of fibres are assessed. Moreover, recent processing methods of dry and semi-finished carbon fibre scrap are also reviewed. Specific attention is paid to the recent developments in producing hybrid yarns and nonwovens made of waste carbon fibre. The methodologies developed in this area, their processing conditions, as well as other important findings are discussed. This review paper provides a valuable platform for researchers and decision makers working in the field of carbon fibre by providing a clearer picture on the options available to recycle CFRC, and the methods of developing value-added products using waste carbon fibre.",2020-12-11,2020,Esfandiar Pakdel; Sima Kashi; Russell J.

W3106046197,"Linking the Remote Sensing of Geodiversity and Traits Relevant to Biodiversity—Part II: Geomorphology, Terrain and Surfaces","The status, changes, and disturbances in geomorphological regimes can be regarded as controlling and regulating factors for biodiversity. Therefore, monitoring geomorphology at local, regional, and global scales is not only necessary to conserve geodiversity, but also to preserve biodiversity, as well as to improve biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. Numerous remote sensing (RS) approaches and platforms have been used in the past to enable a cost-effective, increasingly freely available, comprehensive, repetitive, standardized, and objective monitoring of geomorphological characteristics and their traits. This contribution provides a state-of-the-art review for the RS-based monitoring of these characteristics and traits, by presenting examples of aeolian, fluvial, and coastal landforms. Different examples for monitoring geomorphology as a crucial discipline of geodiversity using RS are provided, discussing the implementation of RS technologies such as LiDAR, RADAR, as well as multi-spectral and hyperspectral sensor technologies. Furthermore, data products and RS technologies that could be used in the future for monitoring geomorphology are introduced. The use of spectral traits (ST) and spectral trait variation (STV) approaches with RS enable the status, changes, and disturbances of geomorphic diversity to be monitored. We focus on the requirements for future geomorphology monitoring specifically aimed at overcoming some key limitations of ecological modeling, namely: the implementation and linking of in-situ, close-range, air- and spaceborne RS technologies, geomorphic traits, and data science approaches as crucial components for a better understanding of the geomorphic impacts on complex ecosystems. This paper aims to impart multidimensional geomorphic information obtained by RS for improved utilization in biodiversity monitoring.",2020-11-10,2020,Angela Lausch; Michael E. Schaepman; Andrew K.

W3104562917,Phase 3 Trial of Interleukin-1 Trap Rilonacept in Recurrent Pericarditis,"Interleukin-1 has been implicated as a mediator of recurrent pericarditis. The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial involving patients with recurrent pericarditis.We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven, randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of recurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic inflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were enrolled in a 12-week run-in period, during which rilonacept was initiated and background medications were discontinued. Patients who had a clinical response (i.e., met prespecified response criteria) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive continued rilonacept monotherapy or placebo, administered subcutaneously once weekly. The primary efficacy end point, assessed with a Cox proportional-hazards model, was the time to the first pericarditis recurrence. Safety was also assessed.A total of 86 patients with pericarditis pain and an elevated CRP level were enrolled in the run-in period. During the run-in period, the median time to resolution or near-resolution of pain was 5 days, and the median time to normalization of the CRP level was 7 days. A total of 61 patients underwent randomization. During the randomized-withdrawal period, there were too few recurrence events in the rilonacept group to allow for the median time to the first adjudicated recurrence to be calculated; the median time to the first adjudicated recurrence in the placebo group was 8.6 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0 to 11.7; hazard ratio in a Cox proportional-hazards model, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.18; P<0.001 by the log-rank test). During this period, 2 of 30 patients (7%) in the rilonacept group had a pericarditis recurrence, as compared with 23 of 31 patients (74%) in the placebo group. In the run-in period, 4 patients had adverse events leading to the discontinuation of rilonacept therapy. The most common adverse events with rilonacept were injection-site reactions and upper respiratory tract infections.Among patients with recurrent pericarditis, rilonacept led to rapid resolution of recurrent pericarditis episodes and to a significantly lower risk of pericarditis recurrence than placebo.

W3134465096,"ACIX-Aqua: A global assessment of atmospheric correction methods for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 over lakes, rivers, and coastal waters","Atmospheric correction over inland and coastal waters is one of the major remaining challenges in aquatic remote sensing, often hindering the quantitative retrieval of biogeochemical variables and analysis of their spatial and temporal variability within aquatic environments. The Atmospheric Correction Intercomparison Exercise (ACIX-Aqua), a joint NASA – ESA activity, was initiated to enable a thorough evaluation of eight state-of-the-art atmospheric correction (AC) processors available for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data processing. Over 1000 radiometric matchups from both freshwaters (rivers, lakes, reservoirs) and coastal waters were utilized to examine the quality of derived aquatic reflectances (ρ̂w). This dataset originated from two sources: Data gathered from the international scientific community (henceforth called Community Validation Database, CVD), which captured predominantly inland water observations, and the Ocean Color component of AERONET measurements (AERONET-OC), representing primarily coastal ocean environments. This volume of data permitted the evaluation of the AC processors individually (using all the matchups) and comparatively (across seven different Optical Water Types, OWTs) using common matchups. We found that the performance of the AC processors differed for CVD and AERONET-OC matchups, likely reflecting inherent variability in aquatic and atmospheric properties between the two datasets. For the former, the median errors in ρ̂w560 and ρ̂w664 were found to range from 20 to 30% for best-performing processors. Using the AERONET-OC matchups, our performance assessments showed that median errors within the 15–30% range in these spectral bands may be achieved. The largest uncertainties were associated with the blue bands (25 to 60%) for best-performing processors considering both CVD and AERONET-OC assessments. We further assessed uncertainty propagation to the downstream products such as near-surface concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Using satellite matchups from the CVD along with in situ Chla and TSS, we found that 20–30% uncertainties in ρ̂w490≤λ≤743nm yielded 25–70% uncertainties in derived Chla and TSS products for top-performing AC processors. We summarize our results using performance matrices guiding the satellite user community through the OWT-specific relative performance of AC processors. Our analysis stresses the need for better representation of aerosols, particularly absorbing ones, and improvements in corrections for sky- (or sun-) glint and adjacency effects, in order to achieve higher quality downstream products in freshwater and coastal ecosystems.",2021-03-09,2021,Nima Pahlevan; Antoine Mangin; Sundarabalan V.

W3015351360,Rainfall Induced Landslide Studies in Indian Himalayan Region: A Critical Review,"Landslides are one of the most devastating and recurring natural disasters and have affected several mountainous regions across the globe. The Indian Himalayan region is no exception to landslide incidences affecting key economic sectors such as transportation and agriculture and often leading to loss of lives. As reflected in the global landslide dataset, most of the landslides in this region are rainfall triggered. The region is prone to 15% of the global rainfall-induced landslides, and thereby a review of the studies in the region is inevitable. The high exposure to landslide risk has made the Indian Himalayas receive growing attention by the landslides community. A review of landslides studies conducted in this region is therefore important to provide a general picture of the state-of-the-art, a reference point for researchers and practitioners working in this region for the first time, and a summary of the improvements most urgently needed to better address landslide hazard research and management. This article focuses on various studies ranging from forecasting and monitoring to hazard and susceptibility analysis. The various factors used to analyze landslide are also studied for various landslide zones in the region. The analysis reveals that there are several avenues where significant research work is needed such as the inclusion of climate change factors or the acquisition of basic data of highest quality to be used as input data for computational models. In addition, the review reveals that, despite the entire region being highly landslide prone, most of the studies have focused on few regions and large areas have been neglected. The aim of the review is to provide a reference for stakeholders and researchers who are currently or looking to work in the Indian Himalayas, to highlight the shortcomings and the points of strength of the research being conducted, and to provide a contribution in addressing the future developments most urgently needed to obtain a consistent advance in landslide risk reduction of the area.",2020-04-03,2020,Abhirup Dikshit; Raju Sarkar; Biswajeet Pradhan; Samuele Segoni; Abdullah Alamri,University of Technology Sydney,Applied Sciences,260,https://doi.org/10.3390/app10072466,Energy_Sustainability,Landslide; Hazard; Natural disaster; Natural hazard; Geography,0.283

W4213239123,Overview of the MOSAiC expedition: Snow and sea ice,"Year-round observations of the physical snow and ice properties and processes that govern the ice pack evolution and its interaction with the atmosphere and the ocean were conducted during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition of the research vessel Polarstern in the Arctic Ocean from October 2019 to September 2020. This work was embedded into the interdisciplinary design of the 5 MOSAiC teams, studying the atmosphere, the sea ice, the ocean, the ecosystem, and biogeochemical processes. The overall aim of the snow and sea ice observations during MOSAiC was to characterize the physical properties of the snow and ice cover comprehensively in the central Arctic over an entire annual cycle. This objective was achieved by detailed observations of physical properties and of energy and mass balance of snow and ice. By studying snow and sea ice dynamics over nested spatial scales from centimeters to tens of kilometers, the variability across scales can be considered. On-ice observations of in situ and remote sensing properties of the different surface types over all seasons will help to improve numerical process and climate models and to establish and validate novel satellite remote sensing methods; the linkages to accompanying airborne measurements, satellite observations, and results of numerical models are discussed. We found large spatial variabilities of snow metamorphism and thermal regimes impacting sea ice growth. We conclude that the highly variable snow cover needs to be considered in more detail (in observations, remote sensing, and models) to better understand snow-related feedback processes. The ice pack revealed rapid transformations and motions along the drift in all seasons. The number of coupled ice–ocean interface processes observed in detail are expected to guide upcoming research with respect to the changing Arctic sea ice.",2022-01-01,2022,Marcel Nicolaus; Donald K.

W4290830217,Oxidation and fragmentation of plastics in a changing environment; from UV-radiation to biological degradation,"Understanding the fate of plastics in the environment is of critical importance for the quantitative assessment of the biological impacts of plastic waste. Specially, there is a need to analyze in more detail the reputed longevity of plastics in the context of plastic degradation through oxidation and fragmentation reactions. Photo-oxidation of plastic debris by solar UV radiation (UVR) makes material prone to subsequent fragmentation. The fragments generated following oxidation and subsequent exposure to mechanical stresses include secondary micro- or nanoparticles, an emerging class of pollutants. The paper discusses the UV-driven photo-oxidation process, identifying relevant knowledge gaps and uncertainties. Serious gaps in knowledge exist concerning the wavelength sensitivity and the dose-response of the photo-fragmentation process. Given the heterogeneity of natural UV irradiance varying from no exposure in sediments to full UV exposure of floating, beach litter or air-borne plastics, it is argued that the rates of UV-driven degradation/fragmentation will also vary dramatically between different locations and environmental niches. Biological phenomena such as biofouling will further modulate the exposure of plastics to UV radiation, while potentially also contributing to degradation and/or fragmentation of plastics independent of solar UVR. Reductions in solar UVR in many regions, consequent to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments for protecting stratospheric ozone, will have consequences for global UV-driven plastic degradation in a heterogeneous manner across different geographic and environmental zones. The interacting effects of global warming, stratospheric ozone and UV radiation are projected to increase UV irradiance at the surface in localized areas, mainly because of decreased cloud cover. Given the complexity and uncertainty of future environmental conditions, this currently precludes reliable quantitative predictions of plastic persistence on a global scale.",2022-08-12,2022,Anthony L.

We show that marine species richness levels off or declines in latitudinal bands with average annual sea surface temperatures exceeding 20 °C. This results in a dip in species richness around the equator that has become more pronounced as the climate has warmed, especially for pelagic species.

W3096321968,Exponential increase of plastic burial in mangrove sediments as a major plastic sink,"Sequestration of plastics in sediments is considered the ultimate sink of marine plastic pollution that would justify unexpectedly low loads found in surface waters. Here, we demonstrate that mangroves, generally supporting high sediment accretion rates, efficiently sequester plastics in their sediments. To this end, we extracted microplastics from dated sediment cores of the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf mangrove (Avicennia marina) forests along the Saudi Arabian coast. We found that microplastics <0.5 mm dominated in mangrove sediments, helping explain their scarcity, in surface waters. We estimate that 50 ± 30 and 110 ± 80 metric tons of plastic may have been buried since the 1930s in mangrove sediments across the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf, respectively. We observed an exponential increase in the plastic burial rate (8.5 ± 1.2% year-1) since the 1950s in line with the global plastic production increase, confirming mangrove sediments as long-term sinks for plastics.",2020-10-28,2020,Cecilia Martin; Fadiyah M.

W4200444845,Global maps of soil temperature,"Research in global change ecology relies heavily on global climatic grids derived from estimates of air temperature in open areas at around 2 m above the ground. These climatic grids do not reflect conditions below vegetation canopies and near the ground surface, where critical ecosystem functions occur and most terrestrial species reside. Here, we provide global maps of soil temperature and bioclimatic variables at a 1-km2 resolution for 0–5 and 5–15 cm soil depth. These maps were created by calculating the difference (i.e. offset) between in situ soil temperature measurements, based on time series from over 1200 1-km2 pixels (summarized from 8519 unique temperature sensors) across all the world's major terrestrial biomes, and coarse-grained air temperature estimates from ERA5-Land (an atmospheric reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). We show that mean annual soil temperature differs markedly from the corresponding gridded air temperature, by up to 10°C (mean = 3.0 ± 2.1°C), with substantial variation across biomes and seasons. Over the year, soils in cold and/or dry biomes are substantially warmer (+3.6 ± 2.3°C) than gridded air temperature, whereas soils in warm and humid environments are on average slightly cooler (−0.7 ± 2.3°C). The observed substantial and biome-specific offsets emphasize that the projected impacts of climate and climate change on near-surface biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are inaccurately assessed when air rather than soil temperature is used, especially in cold environments. The global soil-related bioclimatic variables provided here are an important step forward for any application in ecology and related disciplines. Nevertheless, we highlight the need to fill remaining geographic gaps by collecting more in situ measurements of microclimate conditions to further enhance the spatiotemporal resolution of global soil temperature products for ecological applications.",2021-12-30,2021,Jonas J.

However, the relationships between soil microbial groups (bacteria, fungi and microscopic fauna) and biochar physicochemical properties have not been summarized. In this review, we conclude that biochar affects soil microbial growth, diversity and community compositions by directly providing growth promoters for soil biota or indirectly changing soil basic properties. The porous structure, labile C, high pH and electrochemical properties of biochar play an important role in determining soil microbial abundance and communities, and their mediated N and P cycling processes, while the effects and underlying mechanisms vary with biochar types that are affected by pyrolysis temperature and feedstock type. Finally, we highlight some issues related to research methodology and subjects that are still poorly understood or controversial, and the perspectives for further research in microbial responses to biochar addition.",2021-06-29,2021,Zhongmin Dai; Xinquan Xiong; Hang Zhu; Haojie Xu; Peng Leng,La Trobe University,Biochar,248,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42773-021-00099-x,Energy_Sustainability,Biochar; Soil biology; Nutrient cycle; Slash-and-char; Soil fertility,0.267
W3208573340,Next-generation ensemble projections reveal higher climate risks for marine ecosystems,"Projections of climate change impacts on marine ecosystems have revealed long-term declines in global marine animal biomass and unevenly distributed impacts on fisheries. Here we apply an enhanced suite of global marine ecosystem models from the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (Fish-MIP), forced by new-generation Earth system model outputs from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), to provide insights into how projected climate change will affect future ocean ecosystems. Compared with the previous generation CMIP5-forced Fish-MIP ensemble, the new ensemble ecosystem simulations show a greater decline in mean global ocean animal biomass under both strong-mitigation and high-emissions scenarios due to elevated warming, despite greater uncertainty in net primary production in the high-emissions scenario. Regional shifts in the direction of biomass changes highlight the continued and urgent need to reduce uncertainty in the projected responses of marine ecosystems to climate change to help support adaptation planning.",2021-10-21,2021,Derek P.

W3003790026,Floating macro- and microplastics around the Southern Ocean: Results from the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition,"While macroplastics have been washing up on Southern Ocean islands for decades and microplastics have been found in seabirds from the region since 1960, there are still relatively few quantitative data on the amount of plastic pollution, especially with regard to floating plastics, at high southern latitudes. We present a baseline estimate of the abundance of floating plastics around the Southern Ocean from a survey of floating macro-, meso- and microplastic pollution conducted during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition in 2016/17. A total of 40 net trawls and 626 h of observation were performed during this survey. Of these, 33 net samples and 552 h of observation were made in polar waters south of the Subtropical Front (STF). Only 5 microplastics and 17 macrolitter items were observed south of the STF, confirming the Southern Ocean as the region with the lowest concentrations of plastic pollution globally. The mean concentrations of floating macrolitter (0.02-0.03 items·km-2) and small plastic fragments (188 ± 589 particles·km-2) south of the STF were one order of magnitude lower than in adjacent temperate waters north of the STF, which suggests that the STF acts as a barrier to the southward transport of floating debris. Despite their much lower density, the mass of macroplastics was similar to that of floating microplastics in the Southern Ocean.",2020-01-27,2020,Giuseppe Suaria; Vonica Perold; Jasmine Lee; Fabrice Lebouard; Stefano Aliani,Monash University,Environment International,247,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105494,Energy_Sustainability,Microplastics; Oceanography; Plastic pollution; Environmental science; Marine debris,0.15
W3029154092,Using soil bacterial communities to predict physico-chemical variables and soil quality,"Abstract Background Soil ecosystems consist of complex interactions between biological communities and physico-chemical variables, all of which contribute to the overall quality of soils. Despite this, changes in bacterial communities are ignored by most soil monitoring programs, which are crucial to ensure the sustainability of land management practices. We applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the bacterial community composition of over 3000 soil samples from 606 sites in New Zealand. Sites were classified as indigenous forests, exotic forest plantations, horticulture, or pastoral grasslands; soil physico-chemical variables related to soil quality were also collected. The composition of soil bacterial communities was then used to predict the land use and soil physico-chemical variables of each site. Results Soil bacterial community composition was strongly linked to land use, to the extent where it could correctly determine the type of land use with 85% accuracy. Despite the inherent variation introduced by sampling across ~ 1300 km distance gradient, the bacterial communities could also be used to differentiate sites grouped by key physico-chemical properties with up to 83% accuracy. Further, individual soil variables such as soil pH, nutrient concentrations and bulk density could be predicted; the correlations between predicted and true values ranged from weak ( R 2 value = 0.35) to strong ( R 2 value = 0.79). These predictions were accurate enough to allow bacterial communities to assign the correct soil quality scores with 50–95% accuracy. Conclusions The inclusion of biological information when monitoring soil quality is crucial if we wish to gain a better, more accurate understanding of how land management impacts the soil ecosystem. We have shown that soil bacterial communities can provide biologically relevant insights on the impacts of land use on soil ecosystems. Furthermore, their ability to indicate changes in individual soil parameters shows that analysing bacterial DNA data can be used to screen soil quality.",2020-06-02,2020,Syrie M. Hermans; Hannah L.

W3110809545,The 2021 battery technology roadmap,"Abstract Sun, wind and tides have huge potential in providing us electricity in an environmental-friendly way. However, its intermittency and non-dispatchability are major reasons preventing full-scale adoption of renewable energy generation. Energy storage will enable this adoption by enabling a constant and high-quality electricity supply from these systems. But which storage technology should be considered is one of important issues. Nowadays, great effort has been focused on various kinds of batteries to store energy, lithium-related batteries, sodium-related batteries, zinc-related batteries, aluminum-related batteries and so on. Some cathodes can be used for these batteries, such as sulfur, oxygen, layered compounds. In addition, the construction of these batteries can be changed into flexible, flow or solid-state types. There are many challenges in electrode materials, electrolytes and construction of these batteries and research related to the battery systems for energy storage is extremely active. With the myriad of technologies and their associated technological challenges, we were motivated to assemble this 2020 battery technology roadmap.",2020-12-14,2020,Jianmin Ma; Yutao Li; Nicholas S.

W3161219580,Global declines in coral reef calcium carbonate production under ocean acidification and warming,"Significance The growth of coral reefs is threatened by the dual stressors of ocean warming and acidification. Despite a wealth of studies assessing the impacts of climate change on individual taxa, projections of their impacts on coral reef net carbonate production are limited. By projecting impacts across 233 different locations, we demonstrate that the majority of coral reefs will be unable to maintain positive net carbonate production globally by the year 2100 under representative concentration pathways RCP4.5 and 8.5, while even under RCP2.6, coral reefs will suffer reduced accretion rates. Our results provide quantitative projections of how different climate change stressors will influence whole ecosystem carbonate production across coral reefs in all major ocean basins.",2021-05-10,2021,Christopher E.

W4200104361,Electrocatalytic Water Splitting: From Harsh and Mild Conditions to Natural Seawater,"Electrocatalytic water splitting is regarded as the most effective pathway to generate green energy-hydrogen-which is considered as one of the most promising clean energy solutions to the world's energy crisis and climate change mitigation. Although electrocatalytic water splitting has been proposed for decades, large-scale industrial hydrogen production is hindered by high electricity cost, capital investment, and electrolysis media. Harsh conditions (strong acid/alkaline) are widely used in electrocatalytic mechanism studies, and excellent catalytic activities and efficiencies have been achieved. However, the practical application of electrocatalytic water splitting in harsh conditions encounters several obstacles, such as corrosion issues, catalyst stability, and membrane technical difficulties. Thus, the research on water splitting in mild conditions (neutral/near neutral), even in natural seawater, has aroused increasing attention. However, the mechanism in mild conditions or natural seawater is not clear. Herein, different conditions in electrocatalytic water splitting are reviewed and the effects and proposed mechanisms in the three conditions are summarized. Then, a comparison of the reaction process and the effects of the ions in different electrolytes are presented. Finally, the challenges and opportunities associated with direct electrocatalytic natural seawater splitting and the perspective are presented to promote the progress of hydrogen production by water splitting.",2021-12-08,2021,Xue Xiao; Lijun Yang; Wenping Sun; Yu Chen; Hai Yu,Swinburne University of Technology,Small,244,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202105830,Energy_Sustainability,Water splitting; Seawater; Electrolysis; Catalysis; Hydrogen production,0.55
W3047269693,Critical success factors for a circular economy: Implications for business strategy and the environment,"Abstract Eco‐efficiency and resource optimization for business strategy and the environment can be achieved by the circular economy (CE) practices in supply chains (SCs). The leather industry is a significant industrial contributor to the economic growth of some countries, but at the same time, it leads to tremendous environmental pollution. This research focuses on the identification and evaluation of critical success factors (CSFs) needed in the business strategy development of CE practices as well as to minimize environmental pollution in leather industry SCs. The CSFs are identified via a comprehensive literature review and are validated by experts' opinions. The validated CSFs are further analyzed using the best–worst method (BWM) and the decision‐making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). The BWM is used to identify the weights of the CSFs, and DEMATEL is used to determine the cause–effect relationship between the CSFs. The findings show that “leadership and top management commitment” is the most important CSF. Six CSFs are classified as causal towards CE practices: “leadership and top management commitment,” “strong legislation towards CE practices,” “ecological scarcity of resources,” “knowledge of CE practices,” “funding support for R&amp;D from the government,” and “competitor pressure on CE practices.” The findings of this study can help managers in the leather industry implement CE practices in their existing SCs to minimize waste.",2020-08-04,2020,Md.

W3216976864,"Heavy metal toxicity, sources, and remediation techniques for contaminated water and soil","Arsenic is a highly toxic metalloid that is extensively distributed in soils and water bodies, resulting in a variety of toxicity mechanisms and harmful effects on humans and environmental health. This paper comprehensively reviews the technological development in arsenic (As) removal from wastewater and contaminated soil, and provides insights into the challenges in effective arsenic removal from the environmental compartments. The arsenic removal efficiency of the available technologies is also discussed in terms of their principle of operation, efficiency, advantages, and shortcomings. Many of the existing technologies are not found economically feasible for the regions of interest or are not applicable at the community level. Some of the techniques are often responsible for producing toxic by-products. Overall, the adsorption technique demonstrated high efficiency of almost 100% and a maximum of 95% in removing arsenic from water and soil, respectively. Novel methods such as the application of nanotechnology and polymeric ligand exchangers have also been gaining traction but also seem to possess limitations similar to conventional and non-conventional techniques.",2021-11-24,2021,Shams Forruque Ahmed; P.

W3014150908,Metrics that matter for assessing the ocean biological carbon pump,"The biological carbon pump (BCP) comprises wide-ranging processes that set carbon supply, consumption, and storage in the oceans’ interior. It is becoming increasingly evident that small changes in the efficiency of the BCP can significantly alter ocean carbon sequestration and, thus, atmospheric CO 2 and climate, as well as the functioning of midwater ecosystems. Earth system models, including those used by the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, most often assess POC (particulate organic carbon) flux into the ocean interior at a fixed reference depth. The extrapolation of these fluxes to other depths, which defines the BCP efficiencies, is often executed using an idealized and empirically based flux-vs.-depth relationship, often referred to as the “Martin curve.” We use a new compilation of POC fluxes in the upper ocean to reveal very different patterns in BCP efficiencies depending upon whether the fluxes are assessed at a fixed reference depth or relative to the depth of the sunlit euphotic zone (Ez). We find that the fixed-depth approach underestimates BCP efficiencies when the Ez is shallow, and vice versa. This adjustment alters regional assessments of BCP efficiencies as well as global carbon budgets and the interpretation of prior BCP studies. With several international studies recently underway to study the ocean BCP, there are new and unique opportunities to improve our understanding of the mechanistic controls on BCP efficiencies. However, we will only be able to compare results between studies if we use a common set of Ez-based metrics.",2020-04-06,2020,Ken O. Buesseler; Philip W. Boyd; Erin Black; David A.

W3009060360,Fjords as Aquatic Critical Zones (ACZs),"In recent decades, the land-ocean aquatic continuum, commonly defined as the interface, or transition zone, between terrestrial ecosystems and the open ocean, has undergone dramatic changes. On-going work has stressed the importance of treating Aquatic Critical Zones (ACZs) as a sensitive system needing intensive investigation. Here, we discuss fjords as an ACZ in the context of sedimentological, geochemical, and climatic impacts. These diverse physical features of fjords are key in controlling the sources, transport, and burial of organic matter in the modern era and over the Holocene. High sediment accumulation rates in fjord sediments allow for high-resolution records of past climate and environmental change where multiple proxies can be applied to fjord sediments that focus on either marine or terrestrial-derived components. Humans through land-use change and climatic stressors are having an impact on the larger carbon stores in fjords. Sediment delivery whether from accelerating erosion (e.g. mining, deforestation, road building, agriculture) or from sequestration of fluvial sediment behind dams has been seriously altered in the Anthropocene. Climate change affecting rainfall and river discharge into fjords will impact the thickness and extent of the low-salinity layer in the upper reaches of the fjord, slowing the rate of the overturning circulation and deep-water renewal – thereby impacting bottom water oxygen concentrations.",2020-03-02,2020,Thomas S.

W3012190144,Non-stomatal limitation of photosynthesis by soil salinity,"Soil salinity is a major threat to agricultural sustainability and a global food security. Until now, most research has concentrated around stomatal limitation to photosynthesis, while non-stomatal limitations receiving much less attention. This work summarizes the current knowledge of impact of salinity on chloroplast metabolism and operation and finding viable solutions to minimize it. The major topics covered are: (1) the key targets of the photosynthetic apparatus under salt stress; (2) a tolerance of PSII to salt stress and its repair; (3) salinity effects on biochemistry of CO2 fixation and its regulation; (4) ionic requirements for optimal operation of chloroplasts; and (5) ion transport systems in chloroplasts that optimize chloroplast performance under hostile saline conditions. We show that enhancing plant capacity for protection by modifying PSI cyclic electron transport, redistribution of electron transport between photosystems, thylakoid membrane composition and photosynthetic antioxidant enzymes activity may be a promising way to improve tolerance to salt stress under real-field condition. It is concluded that revealing the molecular nature of chloroplast ion transporters and understanding the modes of their operation will ensure the future sustainability of the world agriculture and the prospects of biological phytoremediation of salinized land via using salt-tolerant crop germplasm.",2020-03-11,2020,Ting Pan; Minmin Liu; Vladimir D.

W4298620000,Mapping global lake dynamics reveals the emerging roles of small lakes,"Abstract Lakes are important natural resources and carbon gas emitters and are undergoing rapid changes worldwide in response to climate change and human activities. A detailed global characterization of lakes and their long-term dynamics does not exist, which is however crucial for evaluating the associated impacts on water availability and carbon emissions. Here, we map 3.4 million lakes on a global scale, including their explicit maximum extents and probability-weighted area changes over the past four decades. From the beginning period (1984–1999) to the end (2010–2019), the lake area increased across all six continents analyzed, with a net change of +46,278 km 2 , and 56% of the expansion was attributed to reservoirs. Interestingly, although small lakes (&lt;1 km 2 ) accounted for just 15% of the global lake area, they dominated the variability in total lake size in half of the global inland lake regions. The identified lake area increase over time led to higher lacustrine carbon emissions, mostly attributed to small lakes. Our findings illustrate the emerging roles of small lakes in regulating not only local inland water variability, but also the global trends of surface water extent and carbon emissions.",2022-10-01,2022,Xuehui Pi; Qiuqi Luo; Lian Feng; Yang Xu; Jing Tang,Deakin University,Nature Communications,229,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33239-3,Energy_Sustainability,Climate change; Environmental science; Global warming; Physical geography; Global change,0.4
W3007874154,2020 Roadmap on Carbon Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion,"Carbon is a simple, stable and popular element with many allotropes. The carbon family members include carbon dots, carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers, graphene, graphite, graphdiyne and hard carbon, etc. They can be divided into different dimensions, and their structures can be open and porous. Moreover, it is very interesting to dope them with other elements (metal or non-metal) or hybridize them with other materials to form composites. The elemental and structural characteristics offer us to explore their applications in energy, environment, bioscience, medicine, electronics and others. Among them, energy storage and conversion are extremely attractive, as advances in this area may improve our life quality and environment. Some energy devices will be included herein, such as lithium-ion batteries, lithium sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, potassium-ion batteries, dual ion batteries, electrochemical capacitors, and others. Additionally, carbon-based electrocatalysts are also studied in hydrogen evolution reaction and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. However, there are still many challenges in the design and preparation of electrode and electrocatalytic materials.

W3009799547,Too hot to handle: Unprecedented seagrass death driven by marine heatwave in a World Heritage Area,"Abstract The increased occurrence of extreme climate events, such as marine heatwaves (MHWs), has resulted in substantial ecological impacts worldwide. To date, metrics of thermal stress within marine systems have focussed on coral communities, and less is known about measuring stress relevant to other primary producers, such as seagrasses. An extreme MHW occurred across the Western Australian coastline in the austral summer of 2010–2011, exposing marine communities to summer seawater temperatures 2–5°C warmer than average. Using a combination of satellite imagery and in situ assessments, we provide detailed maps of seagrass coverage across the entire Shark Bay World Heritage Area (ca. 13,000 km 2 ) before (2002 and 2010) and after the MHW (2014 and 2016). Our temporal analysis of these maps documents the single largest loss in dense seagrass extent globally (1,310 km 2 ) following an acute disturbance. Total change in seagrass extent was spatially heterogeneous, with the most extensive declines occurring in the Western Gulf, Wooramel Bank and Faure Sill. Spatial variation in seagrass loss was best explained by a model that included an interaction between two heat stress metrics, the most substantial loss occurring when degree heating weeks (DHWm) was ≥10 and the number of days exposed to extreme sea surface temperature during the MHW (DaysOver) was ≥94. Ground truthing at 622 points indicated that change in seagrass cover was predominantly due to loss of Amphibolis antarctica rather than Posidonia australis , the other prominent seagrass at Shark Bay. As seawater temperatures continue to rise and the incidence of MHWs increase globally, this work will provide a basis for identifying areas of meadow degradation, or stability and recovery, and potential areas of resilience.",2020-03-04,2020,Simone Strydom; Kathy Murray; Shaun K.

W3202496016,Enhancing solar steam generation using a highly thermally conductive evaporator support,"Interfacial solar steam generation is an efficient water evaporation technology which has promising applications in desalination, sterilization, water purification and treatment. A common component of evaporator design is a thermal-insulation support placed between the photothermal evaporation surface and bulk water. This configuration, common in 2-dimensional (2D) evaporation systems, minimizes heat loss from evaporation surface to bulk water, thus localizing the heat on the evaporation surface for efficient evaporation. This design is subsequently directly adopted for 3-dimensional (3D) evaporators without any consideration if it is appropriate. However, unlike 2D solar evaporators, the 3D evaporators can also harvest additional energy (other than solar light) from the air and bulk water to enhance evaporation rate. In this scenario, the use of thermal insulator support is not proper since it will hinder energy extraction from water. Here, the traditional 3D evaporator configuration was completely redesigned by using a highly thermally conductive material, instead of a thermal insulator, to connect evaporation surfaces and the bulk water. Much higher evaporation rates were achieved by this strategy, owing to the rapid heat transfer from the bulk water to the evaporation surfaces. Indoor and outdoor tests both confirmed that evaporation performance could be significantly improved by substituting a thermal insulator with thermally conductive support. These findings will redirect the future design of 3D photothermal evaporators.",2021-09-23,2021,Yida Wang; Xuan Wu; Pan Wu; Jingyuan Zhao; Xiaofei Yang,University of South Australia,Science Bulletin,227,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2021.09.018,Energy_Sustainability,Evaporation; Evaporator; Materials science; Desalination; Thermal,0.717
W3213800655,Global increase in wildfire risk due to climate‐driven declines in fuel moisture,"There is mounting concern that global wildfire activity is shifting in frequency, intensity, and seasonality in response to climate change. Fuel moisture provides a powerful means of detecting changing fire potential. Here, we use global burned area, weather reanalysis data, and the Canadian fire weather index system to calculate fuel moisture trends for multiscale biogeographic regions across a gradient in vegetation productivity. We quantify the proportion of days in the local fire season between 1979 and 2019, where fuel moisture content is below a critical threshold indicating extreme fire potential. We then associate fuel moisture trends over that period to vegetation productivity and comment on its implications for projected anthropogenic climate change. Overall, there is a strong drying trend across realms, biomes, and the productivity gradient. Even where a wetting trend is observed, this often indicates a trend toward increasing fire activity due to an expected increase in fuel production. The detected trends across the productivity gradient lead us to conclude global fire activity will increase with anthropogenic climate change.",2021-11-20,2021,Todd Ellis; David M. J. S.

W4213297735,Toward a Fundamental Understanding of Geological Hydrogen Storage,"Geological H2 storage plays a central role to enable the successful transition to the renewable H2 economy and achieve net-zero emission in the atmosphere. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs are already explored with extensive reservoir and operational data. However, residual hydrocarbons can mix with injected H2 in the reservoirs. Furthermore, low density and high diffusivity of H2 may establish H2 leakage from the reservoirs via fault pathways. Interestingly, H2 can be consumed by microorganisms, which results in pore-network precipitation, plugging, and partial permeability impairment. Therefore, stored H2 may be lost in the formations if the storage scenario is not planned cautiously. While salt caverns are safe and commercially proven geo-rock for H2 storage, they have low-storage capacity compared to depleted gas reservoirs. Moreover, salt structures (e.g., domel, bedded) and microorganisms activities in the salt cavern are limiting factors, which can influence the storage process. Accordingly, we discuss challenges and future perspectives of hydrogen storage in different geological settings. We also highlight geographical limitations with diverse microbial communities and theoretical understanding of abiotic transformation (in terms of rock's minerals, i.e., mica and calcite) for geological H2 storage. Regarding the fundamental behavior of H2 in the geological settings, it is less soluble in formation water; therefore, it may achieve less solubility trapping compared to CO2 and CH4. Furthermore, H2 gas could attain higher capillary entrance pressures in porous media over CH4 and CO2 due to higher interfacial tension. Additionally, the low viscosity of H2 may facilitate its injection and production but H2 may establish the secondary trapping and viscous fingering. Thus, this review documents a blend of key information for the amendment of subsurface H2 storage at the industrial scale.",2022-02-15,2022,Adnan Aftab; Aliakbar Hassanpouryouzband; Quan Xie; Laura L.

W3018400452,Changes in soil organic carbon under perennial crops,"Abstract This study evaluates the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) under perennial crops across the globe. It quantifies the effect of change from annual to perennial crops and the subsequent temporal changes in SOC stocks during the perennial crop cycle. It also presents an empirical model to estimate changes in the SOC content under crops as a function of time, land use, and site characteristics. We used a harmonized global dataset containing paired‐comparison empirical values of SOC and different types of perennial crops (perennial grasses, palms, and woody plants) with different end uses: bioenergy, food, other bio‐products, and short rotation coppice. Salient outcomes include: a 20‐year period encompassing a change from annual to perennial crops led to an average 20% increase in SOC at 0–30 cm (6.0 ± 4.6 Mg/ha gain) and a total 10% increase over the 0–100 cm soil profile (5.7 ± 10.9 Mg/ha). A change from natural pasture to perennial crop decreased SOC stocks by 1% over 0–30 cm (−2.5 ± 4.2 Mg/ha) and 10% over 0–100 cm (−13.6 ± 8.9 Mg/ha). The effect of a land use change from forest to perennial crops did not show significant impacts, probably due to the limited number of plots; but the data indicated that while a 2% increase in SOC was observed at 0–30 cm (16.81 ± 55.1 Mg/ha), a decrease in 24% was observed at 30–100 cm (−40.1 ± 16.8 Mg/ha). Perennial crops generally accumulate SOC through time, especially woody crops; and temperature was the main driver explaining differences in SOC dynamics, followed by crop age, soil bulk density, clay content, and depth. We present empirical evidence showing that the FAO perennialization strategy is reasonable, underscoring the role of perennial crops as a useful component of climate change mitigation strategies.",2020-05-15,2020,Alicia Ledo; Pete Smith; Ayalsew Zerihun; Jeanette Whitaker; José Luis Vicente‐Vicente,Curtin University,Global Change Biology,225,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15120,Energy_Sustainability,Soil carbon; Perennial plant; Environmental science; Carbon fibers; Agroforestry,0.417
W3006850521,Fostering natural forest regeneration on former agricultural land through economic and policy interventions,"Abstract Under suitable conditions, deforested land used for agricultural crops or pastures can revert to forest through the assisted or unassisted process of natural regeneration. These naturally regenerating forests conserve biodiversity, provide a wide array of ecosystem goods and services, and support rural economies and livelihoods. Based on studies in tropical and temperate forest ecosystems, we summarize cases where natural regeneration is occurring in agricultural landscapes around the world and identify the socio-ecological factors that favor its development and affect its qualities, outcomes and persistence. We describe how the economic and policy context creates barriers for the development, persistence, and management of naturally regenerating forests, including perverse outcomes of policies intended to enhance protection of native forests. We conclude with recommendations for specific economic and policy interventions at local, national, and global scales to enhance forest natural regeneration and to promote the sustainable management of regrowth forests on former agricultural land while strengthening rural communities and economies.",2020-02-25,2020,Robin L.

W3021317682,"Tree effects on urban microclimate: Diurnal, seasonal, and climatic temperature differences explained by separating radiation, evapotranspiration, and roughness effects","Increasing urban tree cover is an often proposed mitigation strategy against urban heat as trees are expected to cool cities through evapotranspiration and shade provision. However, trees also modify wind flow and urban aerodynamic roughness, which can potentially limit heat dissipation. Existing studies show a varying cooling potential of urban trees in different climates and times of the day. These differences are so far not systematically explained as partitioning the individual tree effects is challenging and impossible through observations alone. Here, we conduct numerical experiments removing and adding radiation, evapotranspiration, and aerodynamic roughness effects caused by urban trees using a mechanistic urban ecohydrological model. Simulations are presented for four cities in different climates (Phoenix, Singapore, Melbourne, Zurich) considering the seasonal and diurnal cycles of air and surface temperatures. Results show that evapotranspiration of well-watered trees alone can decrease local 2 m air temperature at maximum by 3.1– 5.8 °C in the four climates during summer. Further cooling is prevented by stomatal closure at peak temperatures as high vapour pressure deficits limit transpiration. While shading reduces surface temperatures, the interaction of a non-transpiring tree with radiation can increase 2 m air temperature by up to 1.6 – 2.1 °C in certain hours of the day at local scale, thus partially counteracting the evapotranspirative cooling effect. Furthermore, in the analysed scenarios, which do not account for tree wind blockage effects, trees lead to a decrease in urban roughness, which inhibits turbulent energy exchange and increases air temperature during daytime. At night, single tree effects are variable likely due to differences in atmospheric stability within the urban canyon. These results explain reported diurnal, seasonal and climatic differences in the cooling effects of urban trees, and can guide future field campaigns, planning strategies, and species selection aimed at improving local microclimate using urban greenery.",2020-12-28,2020,Naika Meili; Gabriele Manoli; Paolo Burlando; Jan Carmeliet; Winston Chow,Monash University,Urban forestry & urban greening,224,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126970,Energy_Sustainability,Microclimate; Evapotranspiration; Environmental science; Atmospheric sciences; Transpiration,0.492
W3027045949,Climate change attribution and the economic costs of extreme weather events: a study on damages from extreme rainfall and drought,"Abstract An important and under-quantified facet of the risks associated with human-induced climate change emerges through extreme weather. In this paper, we present an initial attempt to quantify recent costs related to extreme weather due to human interference in the climate system, focusing on economic costs arising from droughts and floods in New Zealand during the decade 2007–2017. We calculate these using previously collected information about the damages and losses associated with past floods and droughts, and estimates of the “fraction of attributable risk” that characterizes each event. The estimates we obtain are not comprehensive, and almost certainly represent an underestimate of the full economic costs of climate change, notably chronic costs associated with long-term trends. However, the paper shows the potential for developing a new stream of information that is relevant to a range of stakeholders and research communities, especially those with an interest in the aggregation of the costs of climate change or the identification of specific costs associated with potential liability.",2020-05-20,2020,David J.

W3016874182,Review of life-cycle based methods for absolute environmental sustainability assessment and their applications,"In many regions and at the planetary scale, human pressures on the environment exceed levels that natural systems can sustain. These pressures are caused by networks of human activities, which often extend across countries and continents due to global trade. This has led to an increasing requirement for methods that enable absolute environmental sustainability assessment (AESA) of anthropogenic systems and which have a basis in life cycle assessment (LCA). Such methods enable the comparison of environmental impacts of products, companies, nations, etc, with an assigned share of environmental carrying capacity for various impact categories. This study is the first systematic review of LCA-based AESA methods and their applications. After developing a framework for LCA-based AESA methods, we identified 45 relevant studies through an initial survey, database searches and citation analysis. We characterized these studies according to their intended application, impact categories, basis of carrying capacity estimates, spatial differentiation of environmental model and principles for assigning carrying capacity. We then characterized all method applications and synthesized their results. Based on this assessment, we present recommendations to practitioners on the selection and use of existing LCA-based AESA methods, as well as ways to perform assessments and communicate results to decision-makers. Furthermore, we identify future research priorities intended to extend coverage of all components of the proposed method framework, improve modeling and increase the applicability of methods.",2020-04-16,2020,Anders Bjørn; Chanjief Chandrakumar; Anne‐Marie Boulay; Gabor Doka; Kai Fang,Massey University,Environmental Research Letters,222,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab89d7,Energy_Sustainability,Life-cycle assessment; Sustainability; Environmental science; Absolute (philosophy); Economics,0.417
W3020172758,Partitioning the Uncertainty of Ensemble Projections of Global Glacier Mass Change,"Abstract Glacier mass loss is recognized as a major contributor to current sea level rise. However, large uncertainties remain in projections of glacier mass loss on global and regional scales. We present an ensemble of 288 glacier mass and area change projections for the 21st century based on 11 glacier models using up to 10 general circulation models and four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) as boundary conditions. We partition the total uncertainty into the individual contributions caused by glacier models, general circulation models, RCPs, and natural variability. We find that emission scenario uncertainty is growing throughout the 21st century and is the largest source of uncertainty by 2100. The relative importance of glacier model uncertainty decreases over time, but it is the greatest source of uncertainty until the middle of this century. The projection uncertainty associated with natural variability is small on the global scale but can be large on regional scales. The projected global mass loss by 2100 relative to 2015 (79 ± 56 mm sea level equivalent for RCP2.6, 159 ± 86 mm sea level equivalent for RCP8.5) is lower than, but well within, the uncertainty range of previous projections.",2020-04-25,2020,Ben Marzeion; Regine Hock; Brian Anderson; Andrew Bliss; Nicolas Champollion,Victoria University of Wellington,Earth s Future,221,https://doi.org/10.1029/2019ef001470,Energy_Sustainability,Glacier; Representative Concentration Pathways; Climatology; Future sea level; Environmental science,0.267
W3113271840,Green infrastructure for air quality improvement in street canyons,"Street canyons are generally highly polluted urban environments due to high traffic emissions and impeded dispersion. Green infrastructure (GI) is one potential passive control system for air pollution in street canyons, yet optimum GI design is currently unclear. This review consolidates findings from previous research on GI in street canyons and assesses the suitability of different GI forms in terms of local air quality improvement. Studies on the effects of various GI options (trees, hedges, green walls, green screens and green roofs) are critically evaluated, findings are synthesised, and possible recommendations are summarised. In addition, various measurement methods used for quantifying the effectiveness of street greening for air pollution reduction are analysed. Finally, we explore the findings of studies that have compared plant species for pollution mitigation. We conclude that the influences of different GI options on air quality in street canyons depend on street canyon geometry, meteorological conditions and vegetation characteristics. Green walls, green screens and green roofs are potentially viable GI options in existing street canyons, where there is typically a lack of available planting space. Particle deposition to leaves is usually quantified by leaf washing experiments or by microscopy imaging techniques, the latter of which indicates size distribution and is more accurate. The pollutant reduction capacity of a plant species largely depends on its macromorphology in relation to the physical environment. Certain micromorphological leaf traits also positively correlate with deposition, including grooves, ridges, trichomes, stomatal density and epicuticular wax amount. The complexity of street canyon environments and the limited number of previous studies on novel forms of GI in street canyons mean that offering specific recommendations is currently unfeasible. This review highlights a need for further research, particularly on green walls and green screens, to substantiate their efficacy and investigate technical considerations.",2020-12-09,2020,Mamatha Tomson; Prashant Kumar; Yendle Barwise; Pascal Perez; Hugh Forehead,University of Wollongong,Environment International,221,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.106288,Energy_Sustainability,Canyon; Air quality index; Environmental science; Street canyon; Green infrastructure,0.492
W3210579774,Increasing fire and the decline of fire adapted black spruce in the boreal forest,"Significance Black spruce is the dominant tree species in boreal North America and has shaped forest flammability, carbon storage, and other landscape processes over the last several thousand years. However, climate warming and increases in wildfire activity may be undermining its ability to maintain dominance, shifting forests toward alternative forested and nonforested states. Using data from across North America, we evaluate whether loss of black spruce resilience is already widespread. Resilience was the most common outcome, but drier climatic conditions and more severe fires consistently undermine resilience, often resulting in complete regeneration failure. Although black spruce forests are currently moderately resilient, ongoing warming and drying may alter this trajectory, with large potential consequences for the functioning of this globally important biome.",2021-10-25,2021,Jennifer L.

W4283167236,Exposure Routes and Health Risks Associated with Pesticide Application,"Pesticides play an important role in agricultural development. However, pesticide application can result in both acute and chronic human toxicities, and the adverse effects of pesticides on the environment and human health remain a serious problem. There is therefore a need to discuss the application methods for pesticides, the routes of pesticide exposure, and the health risks posed by pesticide application. The health problems related to pesticide application and exposure in developing countries are of particular concern. The purpose of this paper is to provide scientific information for policymakers in order to allow the development of proper pesticide application technics and methods to minimize pesticide exposure and the adverse health effects on both applicators and communities. Studies indicate that there are four main pesticide application methods, including hydraulic spraying, backpack spraying, basal trunk spraying, and aerial spraying. Pesticide application methods are mainly selected by considering the habits of target pests, the characteristics of target sites, and the properties of pesticides. Humans are directly exposed to pesticides in occupational, agricultural, and household activities and are indirectly exposed to pesticides via environmental media, including air, water, soil, and food. Human exposure to pesticides occurs mainly through dermal, oral, and respiratory routes. People who are directly and/or indirectly exposed to pesticides may contract acute toxicity effects and chronic diseases. Although no segment of the general population is completely protected against exposure to pesticides and their potentially serious health effects, a disproportionate burden is shouldered by people in developing countries. Both deterministic and probabilistic human health risk assessments have their advantages and disadvantages and both types of methods should be comprehensively implemented in research on exposure and human health risk assessment. Equipment for appropriate pesticide application is important for application efficiency to minimize the loss of spray solution as well as reduce pesticide residuals in the environment and adverse human health effects due to over-spraying and residues. Policymakers should implement various useful measures, such as integrated pest management (IPM) laws that prohibit the use of pesticides with high risks and the development of a national implementation plan (NIP) to reduce the adverse effects of pesticides on the environment and on human health.",2022-06-19,2022,Muyesaier Tudi; Hairong Li; Hongying Li; Li Wang; Jia Lyu,Griffith University,Toxics,217,https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics10060335,Energy_Sustainability,Pesticide; Environmental health; Human health; Agriculture; Toxicology,0.283
W4384926279,"Vegans, vegetarians, fish-eaters and meat-eaters in the UK show discrepant environmental impacts","Modelled dietary scenarios often fail to reflect true dietary practice and do not account for variation in the environmental burden of food due to sourcing and production methods. Here we link dietary data from a sample of 55,504 vegans, vegetarians, fish-eaters and meat-eaters with food-level data on greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, eutrophication risk and potential biodiversity loss from a review of 570 life-cycle assessments covering more than 38,000 farms in 119 countries. Our results include the variation in food production and sourcing that is observed in the review of life-cycle assessments. All environmental indicators showed a positive association with amounts of animal-based food consumed. Dietary impacts of vegans were 25.1% (95% uncertainty interval, 15.1-37.0%) of high meat-eaters (≥100 g total meat consumed per day) for greenhouse gas emissions, 25.1% (7.1-44.5%) for land use, 46.4% (21.0-81.0%) for water use, 27.0% (19.4-40.4%) for eutrophication and 34.3% (12.0-65.3%) for biodiversity. At least 30% differences were found between low and high meat-eaters for most indicators. Despite substantial variation due to where and how food is produced, the relationship between environmental impact and animal-based food consumption is clear and should prompt the reduction of the latter.",2023-07-20,2023,Peter Scarborough; Michael Clark; Linda Cobiac; Keren Papier; Anika Knüppel,Griffith University,Nature Food,217,https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-023-00795-w,Energy_Sustainability,Greenhouse gas; Eutrophication; Biodiversity; Fish <Actinopterygii>; Life-cycle assessment,0.267
W3092964437,Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report,"Our understanding of the processes that control the burden and budget of tropospheric ozone has changed dramatically over the last 60 years. Models are the key tools used to understand these changes, and these underscore that there are many processes important in controlling the tropospheric ozone budget. In this critical review, we assess our evolving understanding of these processes, both physical and chemical. We review model simulations from the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project and Chemistry Climate Modelling Initiative to assess the changes in the tropospheric ozone burden and its budget from 1850 to 2010. Analysis of these data indicates that there has been significant growth in the ozone burden from 1850 to 2000 (approximately 43 ± 9%) but smaller growth between 1960 and 2000 (approximately 16 ± 10%) and that the models simulate burdens of ozone well within recent satellite estimates. The Chemistry Climate Modelling Initiative model ozone budgets indicate that the net chemical production of ozone in the troposphere plateaued in the 1990s and has not changed since then inspite of increases in the burden. There has been a shift in net ozone production in the troposphere being greatest in the northern mid and high latitudes to the northern tropics, driven by the regional evolution of precursor emissions. An analysis of the evolution of tropospheric ozone through the 21st century, as simulated by Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models, reveals a large source of uncertainty associated with models themselves (i.e., in the way that they simulate the chemical and physical processes that control tropospheric ozone). This structural uncertainty is greatest in the near term (two to three decades), but emissions scenarios dominate uncertainty in the longer term (2050–2100) evolution of tropospheric ozone. This intrinsic model uncertainty prevents robust predictions of near-term changes in the tropospheric ozone burden, and we review how progress can be made to reduce this limitation.",2020-01-01,2020,A.

W3201463932,Biohydrogen Production From Biomass Sources: Metabolic Pathways and Economic Analysis,"The commercialization of hydrogen as a fuel faces severe technological, economic, and environmental challenges. As a method to overcome these challenges, microalgal biohydrogen production has become the subject of growing research interest. Microalgal biohydrogen can be produced through different metabolic routes, the economic considerations of which are largely missing from recent reviews. Thus, this review briefly explains the techniques and economics associated with enhancing microalgae-based biohydrogen production. The cost of producing biohydrogen has been estimated to be between $10 GJ-1 and $20 GJ-1, which is not competitive with gasoline ($0.33 GJ-1). Even though direct biophotolysis has a sunlight conversion efficiency of over 80%, its productivity is sensitive to oxygen and sunlight availability. While the electrochemical processes produce the highest biohydrogen (>90%), fermentation and photobiological processes are more environmentally sustainable. Studies have revealed that the cost of producing biohydrogen is quite high, ranging between $2.13 kg-1 and 7.24 kg-1 via direct biophotolysis, $1.42kg-1 through indirect biophotolysis, and between $7.54 kg-1 and 7.61 kg-1 via fermentation. Therefore, low-cost hydrogen production technologies need to be developed to ensure long-term sustainability which requires the optimization of critical experimental parameters, microalgal metabolic engineering, and genetic modification.",2021-09-10,2021,Shams Forruque Ahmed; Nazifa Rafa; M.

W4321253950,Aquatic environmental DNA: A review of the macro-organismal biomonitoring revolution,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) is the fastest growing biomonitoring tool fuelled by two key features: time efficiency and sensitivity. Technological advancements allow rapid biodiversity detection at both species and community levels with increasing accuracy. Concurrently, there has been a global demand to standardise eDNA methods, but this is only possible with an in-depth overview of the technological advancements and a discussion of the pros and cons of available methods. We therefore conducted a systematic literature review of 407 peer-reviewed papers on aquatic eDNA published between 2012 and 2021. We observed a gradual increase in the annual number of publications from four (2012) to 28 (2018), followed by a rapid growth to 124 publications in 2021. This was mirrored by a tremendous diversification of methods in all aspects of the eDNA workflow. For example, in 2012 only freezing was applied to preserve filter samples, whereas we recorded 12 different preservation methods in the 2021 literature. Despite an ongoing standardisation debate in the eDNA community, the field is seemingly moving fast in the opposite direction and we discuss the reasons and implications. Moreover, by compiling the largest PCR-primer database to date, we provide information on 522 and 141 published species-specific and metabarcoding primers targeting a wide range of aquatic organisms. This works as a user-friendly ‘distillation’ of primer information that was hitherto scattered across hundreds of papers, but the list also reflects which taxa are commonly studied with eDNA technology in aquatic environments such as fish and amphibians, and reveals that groups such as corals, plankton and algae are under-studied. Efforts to improve sampling and extraction methods, primer specificity and reference databases are crucial to capture these ecologically important taxa in future eDNA biomonitoring surveys. In a rapidly diversifying field, this review synthetises aquatic eDNA procedures and can guide eDNA users towards best practice.",2023-02-18,2023,Miwa Takahashi; Mattia Saccò; Joshua H.

W3090809821,The CO<sub>2</sub> reduction potential for the European industry via direct electrification of heat supply (power-to-heat),"Abstract The decarbonisation of industry is a bottleneck for the EU’s 2050 target of climate neutrality. Replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon electricity is at the core of this challenge; however, the aggregate electrification potential and resulting system-wide CO 2 reductions for diverse industrial processes are unknown. Here, we present the results from a comprehensive bottom-up analysis of the energy use in 11 industrial sectors (accounting for 92% of Europe’s industry CO 2 emissions), and estimate the technological potential for industry electrification in three stages. Seventy-eight per cent of the energy demand is electrifiable with technologies that are already established, while 99% electrification can be achieved with the addition of technologies currently under development. Such a deep electrification reduces CO 2 emissions already based on the carbon intensity of today’s electricity (∼300 gCO 2 kWh el −1 ). With an increasing decarbonisation of the power sector IEA: 12 gCO 2 kWh el −1 in 2050), electrification could cut CO 2 emissions by 78%, and almost entirely abate the energy-related CO 2 emissions, reducing the industry bottleneck to only residual process emissions. Despite its decarbonisation potential, the extent to which direct electrification will be deployed in industry remains uncertain and depends on the relative cost of electric technologies compared to other low-carbon options.",2020-09-30,2020,Silvia Madeddu; Falko Ueckerdt; Michaja Pehl; Juergen H.

Unfortunately, unlike conventional fuels, ammonia combustion features some unfavorable characteristics like high nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, significantly hindering its practical industrial utilization. The present work overviews the state-of-the-art advances in ammonia combustion, that summarize the reaction mechanisms, NOx generation mechanism and mitigation strategies, and how ammonia addition affects soot formation. Fundamental kinetic studies of ammonia pyrolysis and oxidation mechanisms are first reviewed, followed by a discussion of different effective strategies for abating nitrogen oxides. Then, ammonia addition to soot formation in hydrocarbon fuels-based combustion is discussed, and the underpinning mechanisms are described.

W3192962771,Large-scale stationary hydrogen storage via liquid organic hydrogen carriers,"Large-scale stationary hydrogen storage is critical if hydrogen is to fulfill its promise as a global energy carrier. While densified storage via compressed gas and liquid hydrogen is currently the dominant approach, liquid organic molecules have emerged as a favorable storage medium because of their desirable properties, such as low cost and compatibility with existing fuel transport infrastructure. This perspective article analytically investigates hydrogenation systems' technical and economic prospects using liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) to store hydrogen at a large scale compared to densified storage technologies and circular hydrogen carriers (mainly ammonia and methanol). Our analysis of major system components indicates that the capital cost for liquid hydrogen storage is more than two times that for the gaseous approach and four times that for the LOHC approach. Ammonia and methanol could be attractive options as hydrogen carriers at a large scale because of their compatibility with existing liquid fuel infrastructure. However, their synthesis and decomposition are energy and capital intensive compared to LOHCs. Together with other properties such as safety, these factors make LOHCs a possible option for large-scale stationary hydrogen storage. In addition, hydrogen transportation via various approaches is briefly discussed. We end our discussions by identifying important directions for future research on LOHCs.",2021-08-09,2021,Zainul Abdin; Chunguang Tang; Yun Liu; Kylie Catchpole,Australian National University,iScience,210,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102966,Energy_Sustainability,Hydrogen storage; Hydrogen; Energy carrier; Liquid hydrogen; Hydrogen technologies,0.567

Both New South Wales and Queensland have declared a state of emergency after seeing new record high in property losses during this fire season. Recently, ""fires near me"" has become Google's most searched words in Australia, with perhaps months of serious fire weather still to come. The unprecedented fire conditions have threatened lives and homes. At least 2·7 million hectares of New South Wales has been burnt since September, 2019, which was a much earlier start of the fire season than in previous years. The burned area is three times larger than 2019 fires in the Amazon (906 000 hectares) and is still expanding.

Lack of rainfall makes vegetation very dry and flammable. Australia has warmed by more than 1°C since 1910. The warming climate in Australia has been accompanied by heatwaves characterised by increased frequency of occurrence, duration, and maximum temperatures. In 2019, both states entered the bushfire season after a year of hot temperatures and low rainfall, putting many districts under high risk of bushfires.

By comparison, the daily average PM2·5 concentration before the bushfire was around 20 μg/m3.

The long-term and lasting effects of bushfire smoke and which subgroups are most vulnerable to bushfire smoke remain largely unknown.8Finlay SE Moffat A Gazzard R Baker D Murray V Health impacts of wildfires.PLoS Curr. 2012; 4 (e4f959951cce2c)PubMed Google Scholar, 9Reid CE Brauer M Johnston FH Jerrett M Balmes JR Elliott CT Critical review of health impacts of wildfire smoke exposure.Environ Health Perspect. 2016; 124: 1334-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar It has been suggested that PM10 generated from bushfires might have different health effects compared with PM10 from urban background sources (eg, traffic emissions).3Dennekamp M Abramson MJ The effects of bushfire smoke on respiratory health.Respirology. 2011; 16: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar Therefore, more studies are required to focus on air pollutants from bushfires. Unfortunately, there is no effective way to reduce the effects of bushfire smoke on human health, although wearing facemasks and staying indoors are commonly recommended, and many people consider facemasks the best protection. However, facemasks might be not effective or sometimes provide a false sense of security. Their effectiveness depends on their filtration capacity: fine particles can still get through them if capacity is low. Additionally, individual wearing behaviour and characteristics (eg, facial hair, or duration and frequency of wearing a facemask) also affect the efficiency of the facemask. Importantly, wearing a facemask can be uncomfortable in very hot weather when bushfires happen. Even if facemasks could protect adults, it is still questionable whether they could protect children, older individuals, pregnant women, and those with chronic diseases, as these groups often cannot tolerate the inconvenience and discomfort of wearing a mask. Staying indoors might provide some protection against bushfire smoke, but this depends on building quality and ventilation. In general, most residential houses are not equipped with air purifiers or air conditioning systems with high-efficiency filters. Hence, outdoor pollutants can still penetrate into houses, if they are in bad conditions or equipped with air conditioning systems without air filters. Therefore, indoor and outdoor concentrations of fine particles are often very close. Climate change will continue to exacerbate catastrophic bushfire conditions. It has been estimated that days with high-to-extreme risk of fire will increase by 15–70% by 2050, and by more than 100% by 2100, compared with 2010.1Jones RN Young C Handmer J Keating A Mekala G Sheehan P Valuing adaptation under rapid change.https://www.nccarf.edu.au/sites/default/files/attached_files_publications/Jones_2013_Valuing_adaptation_under_rapid_change.pdfDate: 2013Google Scholar Although some politicians claim that climate action is too expensive, the increasing intensity and frequency of bushfires clearly indicate that the price of climate inaction is even higher. Unfortunately, the Australian Government has not engaged well in climate action over the past decade.10Beggs PJ Zhang Y Bambrick H et al.The 2019 report of the MJA-Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: a turbulent year with mixed progress.Med J Aust. 2019; 211: 490-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar Australia is on the track to meet less than half of its carbon emission reduction targets, which are to reduce emissions by 26–28% relative to 2005, by 2030, and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

W4280505419,"Deep-C storage: Biological, chemical and physical strategies to enhance carbon stocks in agricultural subsoils","Due to their substantial volume, subsoils contain more of the total soil carbon (C) pool than topsoils. Much of this C is thousands of years old, suggesting that subsoils offer considerable potential for long-term C sequestration. However, knowledge of subsoil C behaviour and manageability remains incomplete, and subsoil C storage potential has yet to be realised at a large scale, particularly in agricultural systems. A range of biological (e.g. deep-rooting), chemical (e.g. biochar burial) and physical (e.g. deep ploughing) C sequestration strategies have been proposed, but are yet to be assessed. In this review, we identify the main factors that regulate subsoil C cycling and critically evaluate the evidence and mechanistic basis of subsoil strategies designed to promote greater C storage, with particular emphasis on agroecosystems. We assess the barriers and opportunities for the implementation of strategies to enhance subsoil C sequestration and identify 5 key current gaps in scientific understanding. We conclude that subsoils, while highly heterogeneous, are in many cases more suited to long-term C sequestration than topsoils. The proposed strategies may also bring other tangible benefits to cropping systems (e.g. enhanced water holding capacity and nutrient use efficiency). Furthermore, while the subsoil C sequestration strategies we reviewed have large potential, more long-term studies are needed across a diverse range of soils and climates, in conjunction with chronosequence and space-for-time substitutions. Also, it is vital that subsoils are more consistently included in modelled estimations of soil C stocks and C sequestration potential, and that subsoil-explicit C models are developed to specifically reflect subsoil processes. Finally, further mapping of subsoil C is needed in specific regions (e.g. in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, South and Central America, South Asia and Africa). Conducting both immediate and long-term subsoil C studies will fill the knowledge gaps to devise appropriate soil C sequestration strategies and policies to help in the global fight against climate change and decline in soil quality. In conclusion, our evidence-based analysis reveals that subsoils offer an untapped potential to enhance global C storage in terrestrial ecosystems.",2022-05-17,2022,Erik S.

W3022979831,Cascading climate change impacts and implications,"Climate change is expected to have adverse impacts and implications for a range of human-environment systems. However, our understanding of the extent to which these impacts may propagate as cascades, compounding to form multiple impacts across sectors, is limited. Cascades result from interdependencies between systems and sub-systems of coupled natural and socio-economic systems in response to changes and feedback loops. The combined effects of interacting stressors may affect the ability of individuals, governments, and the private sector to adapt in time, before widespread damage occurs. We discuss the origins of cascading impacts thinking and present the results of an investigation of cascading impacts and implications in New Zealand. A participatory and collaborative approach was used through workshops and semi-structured interviews with sector informants, including engineers, local government staff, and financial risk managers and analysts from the financial services sectors. Qualitative data collection was combined with network and systems analysis to examine increased frequency of high-intensity rainfall events, sea-level rise and drought, across urban water infrastructure and the financial services, and the implications of cascading climate change impacts for governance. Results demonstrate that closer consideration of the combined effects of linked stressors can facilitate a better understanding of the scope and scale of climate change impacts. By using critical systems thinking in characterising and assessing how climate change impacts cascade across domains, we show the implications of cascades for their governance and reveal where climate change adaptation interventions might be focused. The research methods and insights into cascades provide a conceptual and practical basis for further development, which can inform the design of additional studies in other domains and jurisdictions.",2020-01-01,2020,Judy Lawrence; Paula Blackett; Nicholas A.

W4281677786,"A review of the recent development, challenges, and opportunities of electronic waste (e-waste)","Abstract This study reviews recent developments, challenges, and the prospect of electronic waste (e-waste). Various aspects of e-waste, including collection, pre-treatment, and recycling, are discussed briefly. It is found that Europe is the leading collector of e-waste, followed by Asia, America, Oceania, and Africa. The monetary worth of e-waste raw materials is estimated to be $57.0 billion. However, only $10.0 billion worth of e-waste is recycled and recovered sustainably, offsetting 15.0 million tonnes (Mt) of CO 2 . The major challenges of e-waste treatment include collection, sorting and inhomogeneity of waste, low energy density, prevention of further waste, emission, and cost-effective recycling. Only 78 countries in the world now have e-waste related legislation. Such legislation is not effectively implemented in most regions. Developing countries like south-eastern Asia and Northern Africa have limited or no e-waste legislation. Therefore, country-specific standards and legislation, public awareness, effective implementation, and government incentives for developing cost-effective technologies are sought to manage e-waste, which will play an important role in the circular economy.",2022-05-31,2022,M.

W3017043543,SoilTemp: A global database of near‐surface temperature,"Current analyses and predictions of spatially explicit patterns and processes in ecology most often rely on climate data interpolated from standardized weather stations. This interpolated climate data represents long-term average thermal conditions at coarse spatial resolutions only. Hence, many climate-forcing factors that operate at fine spatiotemporal resolutions are overlooked. This is particularly important in relation to effects of observation height (e.g. vegetation, snow and soil characteristics) and in habitats varying in their exposure to radiation, moisture and wind (e.g. topography, radiative forcing or cold-air pooling). Since organisms living close to the ground relate more strongly to these microclimatic conditions than to free-air temperatures, microclimatic ground and near-surface data are needed to provide realistic forecasts of the fate of such organisms under anthropogenic climate change, as well as of the functioning of the ecosystems they live in. To fill this critical gap, we highlight a call for temperature time series submissions to SoilTemp, a geospatial database initiative compiling soil and near-surface temperature data from all over the world. Currently, this database contains time series from 7,538 temperature sensors from 51 countries across all key biomes. The database will pave the way toward an improved global understanding of microclimate and bridge the gap between the available climate data and the climate at fine spatiotemporal resolutions relevant to most organisms and ecosystem processes.",2020-04-20,2020,Jonas J.

W3173755534,A critical review on various feedstocks as sustainable substrates for biosurfactants production: a way towards cleaner production,"The quest for a chemical surfactant substitute has been fuelled by increased environmental awareness. The benefits that biosurfactants present like biodegradability, and biocompatibility over their chemical and synthetic counterparts has contributed immensely to their popularity and use in various industries such as petrochemicals, mining, metallurgy, agrochemicals, fertilizers, beverages, cosmetics, etc. With the growing demand for biosurfactants, researchers are looking for low-cost waste materials to use them as substrates, which will lower the manufacturing costs while providing waste management services as an add-on benefit. The use of low-cost substrates will significantly reduce the cost of producing biosurfactants. This paper discusses the use of various feedstocks in the production of biosurfactants, which not only reduces the cost of waste treatment but also provides an opportunity to profit from the sale of the biosurfactant. Furthermore, it includes state-of-the-art information about employing municipal solid waste as a sustainable feedstock for biosurfactant production, which has not been simultaneously covered in many published literatures on biosurfactant production from different feedstocks. It also addresses the myriad of other issues associated with the processing of biosurfactants, as well as the methods used to address these issues and perspectives, which will move society towards cleaner production.",2021-06-26,2021,Swayansu Sabyasachi Mohanty; Yamini Koul; Sunita Varjani; Ashok Pandey; Huu Hao Ngo,University of Technology Sydney,Microbial Cell Factories,205,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-021-01613-3,Energy_Sustainability,Cleaner production; Raw material; Petrochemical; Waste management; Production (economics),0.283

W3046667125,Changing Biogeochemistry of the Southern Ocean and Its Ecosystem Implications,"The Southern Ocean plays a critical role in regulating global climate as a major sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and in global ocean biogeochemistry by supplying nutrients to the global thermocline, thereby influencing global primary production and carbon export. Biogeochemical processes within the Southern Ocean regulate regional primary production and biological carbon uptake, primarily through iron supply, and support ecosystem functioning over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Here we assimilate existing knowledge and present new data to examine the biogeochemical cycles of iron, carbon and major nutrients, their key drivers and their responses to, and roles in, contemporary climate and environmental change. Projected increases in iron supply, coupled with increases in light availability to phytoplankton through increased near-surface stratification and longer ice-free periods, are very likely to increase primary production and carbon export around Antarctica. Biological carbon uptake is likely to increase for the Southern Ocean as a whole, whilst there is greater uncertainty around projections of primary production in the Sub-Antarctic and basin-wide changes in phytoplankton species composition, as well as their biogeochemical consequences. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, higher trophic level organisms and microbial communities are strongly influenced by Southern Ocean biogeochemistry, in particular through nutrient supply and ocean acidification. In turn, these organisms exert important controls on biogeochemistry through carbon storage and export, nutrient recycling and redistribution, and benthic-pelagic coupling. The key processes described in this paper are summarised in the graphical abstract. Climate-mediated changes in Southern Ocean biogeochemistry over the coming decades are very likely to impact primary production, sea-air CO2 exchange and ecosystem functioning within and beyond this vast and critically important ocean region.",2020-07-31,2020,Sian F.

W3092213572,Evaluating Climate Models with the CLIVAR 2020 ENSO Metrics Package,"Abstract El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability on the planet, with far-reaching global impacts. It is therefore key to evaluate ENSO simulations in state-of-the-art numerical models used to study past, present, and future climate. Recently, the Pacific Region Panel of the International Climate and Ocean: Variability, Predictability and Change (CLIVAR) Project, as a part of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), led a community-wide effort to evaluate the simulation of ENSO variability, teleconnections, and processes in climate models. The new CLIVAR 2020 ENSO metrics package enables model diagnosis, comparison, and evaluation to 1) highlight aspects that need improvement; 2) monitor progress across model generations; 3) help in selecting models that are well suited for particular analyses; 4) reveal links between various model biases, illuminating the impacts of those biases on ENSO and its sensitivity to climate change; and to 5) advance ENSO literacy. By interfacing with existing model evaluation tools, the ENSO metrics package enables rapid analysis of multipetabyte databases of simulations, such as those generated by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 5 (CMIP5) and 6 (CMIP6). The CMIP6 models are found to significantly outperform those from CMIP5 for 8 out of 24 ENSO-relevant metrics, with most CMIP6 models showing improved tropical Pacific seasonality and ENSO teleconnections. Only one ENSO metric is significantly degraded in CMIP6, namely, the coupling between the ocean surface and subsurface temperature anomalies, while the majority of metrics remain unchanged.",2020-09-16,2020,Yann Planton; Éric Guilyardi; Andrew T.

W3194131981,A global observational analysis to understand changes in air quality during exceptionally low anthropogenic emission conditions,"This global study, which has been coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization Global Atmospheric Watch (WMO/GAW) programme, aims to understand the behaviour of key air pollutant species during the COVID-19 pandemic period of exceptionally low emissions across the globe. We investigated the effects of the differences in both emissions and regional and local meteorology in 2020 compared with the period 2015–2019. By adopting a globally consistent approach, this comprehensive observational analysis focuses on changes in air quality in and around cities across the globe for the following air pollutants PM2.5, PM10, PMC (coarse fraction of PM), NO2, SO2, NOx, CO, O3 and the total gaseous oxidant (OX = NO2 + O3) during the pre-lockdown, partial lockdown, full lockdown and two relaxation periods spanning from January to September 2020. The analysis is based on in situ ground-based air quality observations at over 540 traffic, background and rural stations, from 63 cities and covering 25 countries over seven geographical regions of the world. Anomalies in the air pollutant concentrations (increases or decreases during 2020 periods compared to equivalent 2015–2019 periods) were calculated and the possible effects of meteorological conditions were analysed by computing anomalies from ERA5 reanalyses and local observations for these periods. We observed a positive correlation between the reductions in NO2 and NOx concentrations and peoples' mobility for most cities. A correlation between PMC and mobility changes was also seen for some Asian and South American cities. A clear signal was not observed for other pollutants, suggesting that sources besides vehicular emissions also substantially contributed to the change in air quality. As a global and regional overview of the changes in ambient concentrations of key air quality species, we observed decreases of up to about 70% in mean NO2 and between 30% and 40% in mean PM2.5 concentrations over 2020 full lockdown compared to the same period in 2015–2019. However, PM2.5 exhibited complex signals, even within the same region, with increases in some Spanish cities, attributed mainly to the long-range transport of African dust and/or biomass burning (corroborated with the analysis of NO2/CO ratio). Some Chinese cities showed similar increases in PM2.5 during the lockdown periods, but in this case, it was likely due to secondary PM formation. Changes in O3 concentrations were highly heterogeneous, with no overall change or small increases (as in the case of Europe), and positive anomalies of 25% and 30% in East Asia and South America, respectively, with Colombia showing the largest positive anomaly of ~70%. The SO2 anomalies were negative for 2020 compared to 2015–2019 (between ~25 to 60%) for all regions. For CO, negative anomalies were observed for all regions with the largest decrease for South America of up to ~40%. The NO2/CO ratio indicated that specific sites (such as those in Spanish cities) were affected by biomass burning plumes, which outweighed the NO2 decrease due to the general reduction in mobility (ratio of ~60%). Analysis of the total oxidant (OX = NO2 + O3) showed that primary NO2 emissions at urban locations were greater than the O3 production, whereas at background sites, OX was mostly driven by the regional contributions rather than local NO2 and O3 concentrations. The present study clearly highlights the importance of meteorology and episodic contributions (e.g., from dust, domestic, agricultural biomass burning and crop fertilizing) when analysing air quality in and around cities even during large emissions reductions. There is still the need to better understand how the chemical responses of secondary pollutants to emission change under complex meteorological conditions, along with climate change and socio-economic drivers may affect future air quality. The implications for regional and global policies are also significant, as our study clearly indicates that PM2.5 concentrations would not likely meet the World Health Organization guidelines in many parts of the world, despite the drastic reductions in mobility. Consequently, revisions of air quality regulation (e.g., the Gothenburg Protocol) with more ambitious targets that are specific to the different regions of the world may well be required.",2021-08-20,2021,Ranjeet S.

W3006978583,Absorption cooling systems – Review of various techniques for energy performance enhancement,"Absorption refrigeration technology was introduced to address some serious issues such as the energy crisis, increased fuel prices, and environmental problems associated with the conventional compression refrigeration systems. It has attracted an increasing deal of interest thanks to such advantages as utilization of low-grade heat sources and environment-friendly working fluid pairs. Nevertheless, this technology suffers from two major obstacles including the usually too large size of the cooling unit and the low coefficient of performance (COP), preventing the absorption systems from being commercially successful. Numerous research works have been done to develop strategies in order to improve the COP of the absorption systems, so as to make the absorption refrigeration technology more competitive with the conventional compression refrigeration systems. In this paper, it is intended to conduct a literature review on various technologies implemented to improve the COP of absorption refrigeration systems. Among effective and promising workarounds for increasing the COP of absorption refrigeration systems, this work refers to cycle design improvement, heat recovery method, development of new working pairs, adding sub-components, and improvement of operating conditions.",2020-02-21,2020,Rasoul Nikbakhti; Xiaolin Wang; Ahmed Kadhim Hussein; Aghil Iranmanesh,University of Tasmania,Alexandria Engineering Journal,202,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aej.2020.01.036,Energy_Sustainability,Absorption refrigerator; Refrigeration; Coefficient of performance; Workaround; Process engineering,0.583

Hydrogen as an energy carrier and energy storage medium has gained enormous interest globally in recent years. Its use in stand-alone or off-grid microgrids for both the urban and rural communities has commenced recently in some locations. Therefore, this research evaluates the techno-economic feasibility of renewable energy-based systems using hydrogen as energy storage for a stand-alone/off-grid microgrid. Three case scenarios in a microgrid environment were identified and investigated in order to select an optimum solution for a remote community by considering the energy balance and techno-economic optimization. The “HOMER Pro” energy modelling and simulating software was used to compare the energy balance, economics and environmental impact amongst the proposed scenarios. The simulation results showed that the hydrogen-battery hybrid energy storage system is the most cost-effective scenario, though all developed scenarios are technically possible and economically comparable in the long run, while each has different merits and challenges. It has been shown that the proposed hybrid energy systems have significant potentialities in electrifying remote communities with low energy generation costs, as well as a contribution to the reduction of their carbon footprint and to ameliorating the energy crisis to achieve a sustainable future.",2020-03-06,2020,Furat Dawood; GM Shafiullah; M.

W3091712078,"Trends in the detection of aquatic non‐indigenous species across global marine, estuarine and freshwater ecosystems: A 50‐year perspective","Aim: The introduction of aquatic non-indigenous species (ANS) has become a major driver for global changes in species biogeography. We examined spatial patterns and temporal trends of ANS detections since 1965 to inform conservation policy and management. Location: Global. Methods: We assembled an extensive dataset of first records of detection of ANS (1965–2015) across 49 aquatic ecosystems, including the (a) year of first collection, (b) population status and (c) potential pathway(s) of introduction. Data were analysed at global and regional levels to assess patterns of detection rate, richness and transport pathways. Results: An annual mean of 43 (±16 SD) primary detections of ANS occurred—one new detection every 8.4 days for 50 years. The global rate of detections was relatively stable during 1965–1995, but increased rapidly after this time, peaking at roughly 66 primary detections per year during 2005–2010 and then declining marginally. Detection rates were variable within and across regions through time. Arthropods, molluscs and fishes were the most frequently reported ANS. Most ANS were likely introduced as stowaways in ships’ ballast water or biofouling, although direct evidence is typically absent. Main conclusions: This synthesis highlights the magnitude of recent ANS detections, yet almost certainly represents an underestimate as many ANS go unreported due to limited search effort and diminishing taxonomic expertise. Temporal rates of detection are also confounded by reporting lags, likely contributing to the lower detection rate observed in recent years. There is a critical need to implement standardized, repeated methods across regions and taxa to improve the quality of global-scale comparisons and sustain core measures over longer time-scales. It will be fundamental to fill in knowledge gaps given that invasion data representing broad regions of the world's oceans are not yet readily available and to maintain knowledge pipelines for adaptive management.",2020-10-02,2020,Sarah A.

W3139513664,A synthesis of health benefits of natural sounds and their distribution in national parks,"Significance This study examines evidence of the health benefits of natural soundscapes and quantifies the prevalence of restorative acoustic environments in national parks across the United States. The results affirm that natural sounds improve health, increase positive affect, and lower stress and annoyance. Also, analyses reveal many national park sites with a high abundance of natural sound and low anthropogenic sound. Raising awareness of natural soundscapes at national parks provides opportunities to enhance visitor health outcomes. Despite more abundant anthropogenic sound, urban and frequently visited sites offered exposure to natural sounds associated with health benefits, making them a valuable target for soundscape mitigation. Our analysis can inform spatial planning that focuses on managing natural soundscapes to enhance human health and experiences.",2021-03-22,2021,Rachel T. Buxton; Amber L.

W3020838257,Thresholds of freshwater biodiversity in response to riparian vegetation loss in the Neotropical region,"Abstract Protecting riparian vegetation around streams is vital in reducing the detrimental effects of environmental change on freshwater ecosystems and in maintaining aquatic biodiversity. Thus, identifying ecological thresholds is useful for defining regulatory limits and for guiding the management of riparian zones towards the conservation of freshwater biota. Using nationwide data on fish and invertebrates occurring in small Brazilian streams, we estimated thresholds of native vegetation loss in which there are abrupt changes in the occurrence and abundance of freshwater bioindicators and tested whether there are congruent responses among different biomes, biological groups and riparian buffer sizes. Mean thresholds of native vegetation cover loss varied widely among biomes, buffer sizes and biological groups: ranging from 0.5% to 77.4% for fish, from 2.9% to 37.0% for aquatic invertebrates and from 3.8% to 43.2% for a subset of aquatic invertebrates. Confidence intervals for thresholds were wide, but the minimum values of these intervals were lower for the smaller riparian buffers (50 and 100 m) than larger ones (200 and 500 m), indicating that land use should be kept away from the streams. Also, thresholds occurred at a lower percentage of riparian vegetation loss in the smaller buffers, and were critically lower for invertebrates: reducing only 6.5% of native vegetation cover within a 50‐m riparian buffer is enough to cross thresholds for invertebrates. Synthesis and applications . The high variability in biodiversity responses to loss of native riparian vegetation suggests caution in the use of a single riparian width for conservation actions or policy definitions nationwide. The most sensitive bioindicators can be used as early warning signals of abrupt changes in freshwater biodiversity. In practice, maintaining at least 50‐m wide riparian reserves on each side of streams would be more effective to protect freshwater biodiversity in Brazil. However, incentives and conservation strategies to protect even wider riparian reserves (~100 m) and also taking into consideration the regional context will promote a greater benefit. This information should be used to set conservation goals and to create complementary mechanisms and policies to protect wider riparian reserves than those currently required by the federal law.",2020-05-09,2020,Renato Bolson Dala‐Corte; Adriano S.

W3148866287,The renaissance of Odum's outwelling hypothesis in 'Blue Carbon' science,"The term 'Blue Carbon' was coined about a decade ago to highlight the important carbon sequestration capacity of coastal vegetated ecosystems. The term has paved the way for the development of programs and policies that preserve and restore these threatened coastal ecosystems for climate change mitigation. Blue carbon research has focused on quantifying carbon stocks and burial rates in sediments or accumulating as biomass. This focus on habitat-bound carbon led us to losing sight of the mobile blue carbon fraction. Oceans, the largest active reservoir of carbon, have become somewhat of a blind spot. Multiple recent investigations have revealed high outwelling (i.e., lateral fluxes or horizontal exports) of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon, as well as particulate organic carbon (POC) from blue carbon habitats. In this paper, we conceptualize outwelling in mangrove, saltmarsh, seagrass and macroalgae ecosystems, diagnose key challenges preventing robust quantification, and pave the way for future work integrating mobile carbon in the blue carbon framework. Outwelling in mangroves and saltmarshes is usually dominated by DIC (mostly as bicarbonate), while POC seems to be the major carbon species exported from seagrass meadows and macroalgae forests. Carbon outwelling science is still in its infancy, and estimates remain limited spatially and temporally. Nevertheless, the existing datasets imply that carbon outwelling followed by ocean storage is relevant and may exceed local sediment burial as a long-term (>centuries) blue carbon sequestration mechanism. If this proves correct as more data emerge, ignoring carbon outwelling may underestimate the perceived sequestration capacity of blue carbon ecosystems.",2021-04-03,2021,Isaac R. Santos; David J.

W4367679241,Long‐Cycle‐Life Cathode Materials for Sodium‐Ion Batteries toward Large‐Scale Energy Storage Systems,"Abstract The development of large‐scale energy storage systems (ESSs) aimed at application in renewable electricity sources and in smart grids is expected to address energy shortage and environmental issues. Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) exhibit remarkable potential for large‐scale ESSs because of the high richness and accessibility of sodium reserves. Using low‐cost and abundant elements in cathodes with long cycling stability is preferable for lowering expenses on cathodes. Many investigated cathodes for SIBs are dogged by structural and morphology changes, unstable interphases between the cathode and the electrolyte, and air sensitivity, causing unsatisfactory cycling performance. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of capacity degeneration in depth and developing precise solutions are critical for designing low‐cost cathodes that are highly stable under cycling. Herein, recent progress in long‐cycle‐life and low‐cost cathodes for SIBs is focused on, and a comprehensive discussion of the key points in SIBs toward large‐scale applications is provided. The roots of the unstable cycling performance of low‐cost cathodes are discussed. Also, effective strategies are summarized from the recent progress on long‐cycle‐life and low‐cost cathodes. This review is expected to encourage deeper investigation of long‐lifespan cathodes for SIBs, particularly for potential large‐scale industrialization.",2023-05-01,2023,Hang Zhang; Yun Gao; Xiaohao Liu; Li‐Feng Zhou; Jiayang Li,University of Wollongong,Advanced Energy Materials,197,https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202300149,Energy_Sustainability,Cathode; Materials science; Energy storage; Economic shortage; Renewable energy,0.85
W3015226025,iEcology: Harnessing Large Online Resources to Generate Ecological Insights,"iEcology is a new research approach that seeks to quantify patterns and processes in the natural world using data accumulated in digital sources collected for other purposes.iEcology studies have provided new insights into species occurrences, traits, phenology, functional roles, behavior, and abiotic environmental features.iEcology is expanding, and will be able to provide valuable support for ongoing research efforts, as comparatively low-cost research based on freely available data.We expect that iEcology will experience rapid development over coming years and become one of the major research approaches in ecology, enhanced by emerging technologies such as automated content analysis, apps, internet of things, ecoacoustics, web scraping, and open source hardware. Digital data are accumulating at unprecedented rates. These contain a lot of information about the natural world, some of which can be used to answer key ecological questions. Here, we introduce iEcology (i.e., internet ecology), an emerging research approach that uses diverse online data sources and methods to generate insights about species distribution over space and time, interactions and dynamics of organisms and their environment, and anthropogenic impacts. We review iEcology data sources and methods, and provide examples of potential research applications. We also outline approaches to reduce potential biases and improve reliability and applicability. As technologies and expertise improve, and costs diminish, iEcology will become an increasingly important means to gain novel insights into the natural world.

We review iEcology data sources and methods, and provide examples of potential research applications. We also outline approaches to reduce potential biases and improve reliability and applicability. As technologies and expertise improve, and costs diminish, iEcology will become an increasingly important means to gain novel insights into the natural world. The information age is characterized by rapid accumulation of myriad types of digital data [1.Castells M. The Information Age: Economy. Blackwell, Society and Culture1996Google Scholar]. Central to this revolution is the Internet, which is a source of unprecedented amounts of diverse and readily accessible data, via webpages, social media, and various other data platforms. These data are constantly created and stored in the digital realm and form an omnipresent part of the modern world. They also provide novel opportunities for research that the scientific community is only beginning to explore. Here, we describe an emerging research approach – iEcology (i.e., internet ecology), which we define as the study of ecological patterns and processes using online data generated for other purposes and stored digitally (Figure 1). These data can be used to address fundamental ecological questions and to analyze ecological processes at a range of spatiotemporal scales and across a diverse range of contexts. As such, iEcology has the potential to provide new understandings of ecological dynamics and mechanisms, complementing more traditional methods of obtaining ecological data. While iEcology can be considered to fit within the wider scope of ecological informatics (see Glossary), it is distinct from other uses of Big Data sources in the biological sciences in that data are not specifically and intentionally generated to address ecological and environmental questions [2.Hampton S.E. et al.Big data and the future of ecology.Front. Ecol. Environ. 2013; 11: 156-162Crossref Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 3.LaDeau S.L. et al.The next decade of big data in ecosystem science.Ecosystems. 2017; 20: 274-283Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4.Michener W.K. Jones M.B. Ecoinformatics: supporting ecology as a data-intensive science.Trends Ecol. Evol. 2012; 27: 85-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar]. Moreover, iEcology expands on the traditional scope of ecological informatics with new data sources and dedicated methods to analyze them. iEcology is predominantly focused on collecting, collating, and exploring data generated online by human society, either passively or unintentionally (e.g., Internet search activity, social media interactions, and uploaded data and media), a process also referred to as passive crowdsourcing [5.Ghermandi A. Sinclair M. Passive crowdsourcing of social media in environmental research: a systematic map.Glob. Environ. Chang. 2019; 55: 36-47Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar]. iEcology uses digital methods to access, handle, and analyze these data, in a manner akin to techniques from other research fields such as sociology, culture and media studies, biomedical sciences, computer sciences, and economics [6.Ekman A. Litton J.E. New times, new needs; e-epidemiology.Eur. J. Epidemiol. 2007; 22: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,7.Bohannon J. Google Books, Wikipedia, and the future of culturomics.Science. 2011; 331e6395Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar]. iEcology also shares part of its toolbox with conservation culturomics – an emerging research area in conservation science [8.Ladle R.J. et al.Conservation culturomics.Front. Ecol. Environ. 2016; 14: 269-275Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9.Di Minin E. et al.Prospects and challenges for social media data in conservation science.Front. Environ. Sci. 2015; 3: 63Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 10.Sutherland W.J. et al.A 2018 horizon scan of emerging issues for global conservation and biological diversity.Trends Ecol. Evol. 2018; 33: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar] – albeit with a different focus. Specifically, while conservation culturomics is interested in understanding human engagement with nature, iEcology methods focus on the ecological knowledge that can be gained from these human–nature interactions in the digital realm. iEcology data predominantly give rise to insights that are correlative in nature, similar to other large-scale ecological explorations such as much of macroecology [11.Gaston K.J. Blackburn T.M. Pattern and Process in Macroecology. Blackwell Science, 2000Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar], and should be viewed as such. Here, we present a broad overview and description of iEcology, including its scope, data types, sources and methods, as well as current major caveats and future prospects for the development of this emerging research approach. Several recent studies have highlighted the potential of iEcology (Figure 2). The most common applications of such methods have been to explore species occurrences and their spatiotemporal trends (Figure 3). For example, a study comparing real-world encounter rates of bird species in the USA with Google Trends data found good agreement between the two sources (Figure 2A) [12.Schuetz J.G. Johnston A. Characterizing the cultural niches of North American birds.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 10868-10873Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar]. This showcases the potential of using voluminous search engine data to explore species distributions in many regions. Others have explored species occurrences and distributions using various sources, such as Flickr, news articles, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and Google Trends [13.Barve V.

A particular illustration comes from assessing seasonal migration patterns of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from Wikipedia pageview frequencies (Figure 2B) [32.Mittermeier J.C. et al.A season for all things: phenological imprints in Wikipedia usage and their relevance to conservation.PLoS Biol. 2019; 17e3000146Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar]. In addition to mapping the distribution and occurrences of known species, images uploaded on social media have also been used to identify new species [33.Gonella P.M. et al.Drosera magnifica (Droseraceae): the largest New World sundew, discovered on Facebook.Phytotaxa. 2015; 220: 257-267Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar,34.Rahayu S.

Trait dynamics, evolutionary trends, and biogeographic patterns can also be explored using iEcology methods. For instance, Google Images were used to identify the presence and distribution of hybrid zones of hooded (Corvus cornix) and carrion (Corvus corone) crows in Europe (Figure 2C) [35.Leighton G.R. et al.Just Google it: assessing the use of Google Images to describe geographical variation in visible traits of organisms.Methods Ecol. Evol. 2016; 7: 1060-1070Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar]. Furthermore, spatiotemporal dynamics of biophysical environments, such as solar radiation and various other climatic parameters were characterized using Flickr tags [18.Jeawak S.S. et al.Using Flickr for characterizing the environment: an exploratory analysis.in: 13th International Conference on Spatial Information Theory (COSIT 2017).

For example, feeding patterns of yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus) and green anaconda (Eunectes murinus) were studied using online videos [36.Miranda E.B. et al.The ecology of human-anaconda conflict: a study using internet videos.Trop. Conserv. Sci. 2016; 9: 43-77Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar], while online images that simultaneously depicted African birds and herbivorous mammals were used to construct a web of associations between these two groups (Figure 2D) [37.Mikula P. et al.Large-scale assessment of commensalistic–mutualistic associations between African birds and herbivorous mammals using internet photos.PeerJ. 2018; 6e4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar]. iEcology also provides new opportunities to study animal behavior [15.Dylewski Ł. et al.Social media and scientific research are complementary –YouTube and shrikes as a case study.Sci. Nat. 2017; 104: 48Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar]. For instance, YouTube videos have been used to compare the behavior of red (Sciurus vulgaris) and grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) in different habitats (Figure 2E) [38.Jagiello Z.A. et al.What can we learn about the behaviour of red and grey squirrels from YouTube?.Ecol. Inform. 2019; 51: 52-60Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar]. The sheer volume and coverage of such sources could also prove fertile ground for identifying and tracking the spread of new behaviors [39.Fisher J. Hinde R.A. The opening of milk bottles by birds.Br. Birds. 1949; 42: 347-357Google Scholar, 40.Gil M.A. et al.Social iformation links individual behavior to population and community dynamics.Trends Ecol.

Evol. 2020; 35: 100-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar]. Disease ecology, including knowledge of the occurrence, distribution, prevalence, and severity of diseases, has also recently benefited from iEcology methods [42.Elmer F. et al.Black spot syndrome in reef fishes: using archival imagery and field surveys to characterize spatial and temporal distribution in the Caribbean.Coral Reefs. 2019; 38: 1303-1315Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar]. iEcology methods have also been used to investigate ecosystem and habitat dynamics in response to increasing anthropogenic impacts. For example, videos of the Tour of Flanders cycling race from over 35 years have been used to track phenological changes to vegetation in response to climate change (Figure 2F) [27.De Frenne P. et al.Using archived television video footage to quantify phenology responses to climate change.Methods Ecol. Evol. 2018; 9: 1874-1882Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar]. Images of corals and tweets referring to corals have both been used to evaluate the state and trends of coral reefs in different areas, suffering from various human impacts [43.Haas A.F. et al.Can we measure beauty?

Fish Biol. 2019; 94: 857-864PubMed Google Scholar] have also been studied using image analysis, tweets, and news articles. In the same way, behavioral changes in animals in response to anthropogenic impacts [46.Snijders L. et al.Animal social networks can help wildlife conservation.Trends Ecol. Evol. 2017; 32: 567-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 47.Brakes P. et al.Animal cultures matter for conservation.Science. 2019; 363: 1032-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 48.Sullivan M. et al.Social media as a data resource for monkseal conservation.PLoS One. 2019; 14e0222627Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar] can be tracked by such methods. While inherently varied in scope, other fields within ecology and environmental science could conceivably benefit from iEcology tools and methods, such as functional ecology, macroecology, landscape ecology, and urban ecology. At their core, iEcology data sources fall into two categories: (i) new data uploaded by users for different purposes; and (ii) data on online activity, including data access and search engine usage. Types of data within the first category can comprise text, images, videos, and sounds (Figure 1). The second category is aggregated data and the exploration of frequencies (e.g., the number of times a term was searched or a webpage visited, but could also include interactions on social media such as shares and likes). Both categories have different types of associated metadata that are particularly important for iEcology, such as locality, timestamp, user identity, and links across data. iEcology data sources differ in their scope, availability, ease of access, associated metadata, and therefore utility for different types of research. Potential data sources range from various social media platforms (e.g., Twitter and Flickr) [49.Chamberlain J. Using social media for biomonitoring: how Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and other social networking platforms can provide large-scale biodiversity data.Adv. Ecol. Res. 2018; 59: 133-168Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar], search engines (e.g., Google, Baidu, and Bing), online encyclopedias (e.g., Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Britannica online), and other online repositories (blogs, discussion forums, popular articles, books, etc.). Many of these sources can also be accessed through search engines. The scope of sources differs based on spatiotemporal coverage, linguistic or cultural breadth, data resolution, and the degree of multimedia composition (e.g., text, images, and video) per source. Data also differ in availability: while many sources are freely available, some platforms may restrict availability by limiting data collection (i.e., limits on volume, time frame, or number of queries) or use (e.g., privileged access or paywall restrictions). Sources also differ in their ease of access, from simple online tools embedded at the source (e.g., Google Trends webpage), through open application programming interfaces (APIs) accessible via various dedicated computer scripts (e.g., Wikipedia and Flickr), to APIs with restricted access (e.g., Facebook). However, data availability and ease of access to different sources can also change over time. The analysis of iEcology data faces similar challenges and uses the same solutions as many other approaches for analysis of Big Data [2.Hampton S.E. et al.Big data and the future of ecology.Front. Ecol. Environ. 2013; 11: 156-162Crossref Scopus (516) Google Scholar,50.Bollier D. Firestone C.M. The Promise and Peril of Big Data. Aspen Institute, 2010Google Scholar]. Many of the methods used in iEcology rely on high levels of automation, frequently adopting machine-learning techniques [51.Christin S. et al.Applications for deep learning in ecology.Methods Ecol. Evol. 2019; 10: 1632-1644Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar]. There are different tools that can aid each stage of the research: data access, downloading, handling, extraction, storage, pattern identification and recognition, data analysis, and visualization. These tools are in a constant state of evolution, as illustrated by developments in deep neural network analysis and other emerging technologies (Box 1).Box 1Emerging Technologies Relevant for iEcologyFuture development within iEcology will be enhanced by rapidly developing technologies:Apps and GamesApps on mobile devices are ubiquitous, and often within a person's reach 24-7. Using these to support augmented reality could also provide an interface to generate more detailed data with real-time diagnostics [64.Jepson P. Ladle R.J. Nature apps: waiting for the revolution.Ambio. 2015; 44: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 65.Buettel J.C. Brook B.W. Egress!

Lett. 2017; 10: 160-165Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar]. In addition, apps that 'gamify' nature can motivate the public to interact with their environment, and thus provide more data on species and the environment. Overall, apps and games have the potential to transform how humans interact with nature (both positive and negative) and cause a fundamental shift in the quantity and quality of iEcology data.Automated Content AnalysisThe application of algorithms for analyzing visual, textual, and audio content from digital sources. These methods have allowed, for example, automatic identification, counting, and description of species and individuals from images and videos [67.Di Minin E. et al.Machine learning for tracking illegal wildlife trade on social media.Nat.

W3195183389,From Low- to Net-Zero Carbon Cities: The Next Global Agenda,"This article provides a systematic review of the literature on net-zero carbon cities, their objectives and key features, current efforts, and performance. We discuss how net-zero differs from low-carbon cities, how different visions of a net-zero carbon city relate to urban greenhouse gas accounting, deep decarbonization pathways and their application to cities and urban infrastructure systems, net-zero carbon cities in theory versus practice, lessons learned from net-zero carbon city plans and implementation, and opportunities and challenges in transitioning toward net-zero carbon cities across both sectors and various spatial fabrics within cities. We conclude that it is possible for cities to get to or near net-zero carbon, but this requires systemictransformation. Crucially, a city cannot achieve net-zero by focusing only on reducing emissions within its administrative boundaries. Cities must decarbonize key transboundary supply chains and use urban and regional landscapes to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. Because of carbon lock-in, and the complex interplay between urban infrastructure and behavior, strategic sequencing of mitigation action is essential for cities to achieve net-zero.",2021-08-23,2021,Karen C.

W3039718498,Utilizing ion leaching effects for achieving high oxygen-evolving performance on hybrid nanocomposite with self-optimized behaviors,"Abstract Ion leaching from pure-phase oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts generally exists, leading to the collapse and loss of catalyst crystalline matrix. Here, different from previous design methodologies of pure-phase perovskites, we introduce soluble BaCl 2 and SrCl 2 into perovskites through a self-assembly process aimed at simultaneously tuning dual cation/anion leaching effects and optimizing ion match in perovskites to protect the crystalline matrix. As a proof-of-concept, self-assembled hybrid Ba 0.35 Sr 0.65 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3- δ (BSCF) nanocomposite (with BaCl 2 and SrCl 2 ) exhibits the low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm -2 in 0.1 M KOH. Multiple operando spectroscopic techniques reveal that the pre-leaching of soluble compounds lowers the difference of interfacial ion concentrations and thus endows the host phase in hybrid BSCF with abundant time and space to form stable edge/face-sharing surface structures. These self-optimized crystalline structures show stable lattice oxygen active sites and short reaction pathways between Co–Co/Fe metal active sites to trigger favorable adsorption of OH − species.",2020-07-06,2020,Daqin Guan; Gihun Ryu; Zhiwei Hu; Jing Zhou; Chung‐Li Dong,Curtin University,Nature Communications,191,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17108-5,Energy_Sustainability,Overpotential; Leaching (pedology); Materials science; Ion; Nanocomposite,0.283
W3208822023,Guidelines for Studying Diverse Types of Compound Weather and Climate Events,"Abstract Compound weather and climate events are combinations of climate drivers and/or hazards that contribute to societal or environmental risk. Studying compound events often requires a multidisciplinary approach combining domain knowledge of the underlying processes with, for example, statistical methods and climate model outputs. Recently, to aid the development of research on compound events, four compound event types were introduced, namely (a) preconditioned , (b) multivariate , (c) temporally compounding , and (d) spatially compounding events. However, guidelines on how to study these types of events are still lacking. Here, we consider four case studies, each associated with a specific event type and a research question, to illustrate how the key elements of compound events (e.g., analytical tools and relevant physical effects) can be identified. These case studies show that (a) impacts on crops from hot and dry summers can be exacerbated by preconditioning effects of dry and bright springs. (b) Assessing compound coastal flooding in Perth (Australia) requires considering the dynamics of a non‐stationary multivariate process. For instance, future mean sea‐level rise will lead to the emergence of concurrent coastal and fluvial extremes, enhancing compound flooding risk. (c) In Portugal, deep‐landslides are often caused by temporal clusters of moderate precipitation events. Finally, (d) crop yield failures in France and Germany are strongly correlated, threatening European food security through spatially compounding effects. These analyses allow for identifying general recommendations for studying compound events. Overall, our insights can serve as a blueprint for compound event analysis across disciplines and sectors.",2021-10-25,2021,Emanuele Bevacqua; Carlo De Michele; Colin Manning; Anaïs Couasnon; Andreia Ribeiro,Queensland University of Technology,Earth s Future,191,https://doi.org/10.1029/2021ef002340,Energy_Sustainability,Flooding (psychology); Climate change; Environmental science; Multivariate statistics; Multidisciplinary approach,0.433
W4323921147,Global concurrent climate extremes exacerbated by anthropogenic climate change,"Increases in concurrent climate extremes in different parts of the world threaten the ecosystem and our society. However, spatial patterns of these extremes and their past and future changes remain unclear. Here, we develop a statistical framework to test for spatial dependence and show widespread dependence of temperature and precipitation extremes in observations and model simulations, with more frequent than expected concurrence of extremes around the world. Historical anthropogenic forcing has strengthened the concurrence of temperature extremes over 56% of 946 global paired regions, particularly in the tropics, but has not yet significantly affected concurrent precipitation extremes during 1901–2020. The future high-emissions pathway of SSP585 will substantially amplify the concurrence strength, intensity, and spatial extent for both temperature and precipitation extremes, especially over tropical and boreal regions, while the mitigation pathway of SSP126 can ameliorate the increase in concurrent climate extremes for these high-risk regions. Our findings will inform adaptation strategies to alleviate the impact of future climate extremes.",2023-03-10,2023,Sha Zhou; Bofu Yu; Yao Zhang,Griffith University,Science Advances,191,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abo1638,Energy_Sustainability,Climate extremes; Precipitation; Environmental science; Climate change; Climatology,0.342
W3135095147,Future carbon emissions from global mangrove forest loss,"Abstract Mangroves have among the highest carbon densities of any tropical forest. These ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems can store large amounts of carbon for long periods, and their protection reduces greenhouse gas emissions and supports climate change mitigation. Incorporating mangroves into Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement and their valuation on carbon markets requires predicting how the management of different land‐uses can prevent future greenhouse gas emissions and increase CO 2 sequestration. We integrated comprehensive global datasets for carbon stocks, mangrove distribution, deforestation rates, and land‐use change drivers into a predictive model of mangrove carbon emissions. We project emissions and foregone soil carbon sequestration potential under ‘business as usual’ rates of mangrove loss. Emissions from mangrove loss could reach 2391 Tg CO 2 eq by the end of the century, or 3392 Tg CO 2 eq when considering foregone soil carbon sequestration. The highest emissions were predicted in southeast and south Asia (West Coral Triangle, Sunda Shelf, and the Bay of Bengal) due to conversion to aquaculture or agriculture, followed by the Caribbean (Tropical Northwest Atlantic) due to clearing and erosion, and the Andaman coast (West Myanmar) and north Brazil due to erosion. Together, these six regions accounted for 90% of the total potential CO 2 eq future emissions. Mangrove loss has been slowing, and global emissions could be more than halved if reduced loss rates remain in the future. Notably, the location of global emission hotspots was consistent with every dataset used to calculate deforestation rates or with alternative assumptions about carbon storage and emissions. Our results indicate the regions in need of policy actions to address emissions arising from mangrove loss and the drivers that could be managed to prevent them.",2021-03-01,2021,María Fernanda Adame; Rod M.

W3201622017,"Influence of pressure, temperature and organic surface concentration on hydrogen wettability of caprock; implications for hydrogen geo-storage","Hydrogen (H2) as a cleaner fuel has been suggested as a viable method of achieving the de-carbonization objectives and meeting increasing global energy demand. However, successful implementation of a full-scale hydrogen economy requires large-scale hydrogen storage (as hydrogen is highly compressible). A potential solution to this challenge is injecting hydrogen into geologic formations from where it can be withdrawn again at later stages for utilization purposes. The geo-storage capacity of a porous formation is a function of its wetting characteristics, which strongly influence residual saturations, fluid flow, rate of injection, rate of withdrawal, and containment security. However, literature severely lacks information on hydrogen wettability in realistic geological and caprock formations, which contain organic matter (due to the prevailing reducing atmosphere). We, therefore, measured advancing (θa) and receding (θr) contact angles of mica substrates at various representative thermo-physical conditions (pressures 0.1-25 MPa, temperatures 308–343 K, and stearic acid concentrations of 10−9 - 10−2 mol/L). The mica exhibited an increasing tendency to become weakly water-wet at higher temperatures, lower pressures, and very low stearic acid concentration. However, it turned intermediate-wet at higher pressures, lower temperatures, and increasing stearic acid concentrations. The study suggests that the structural H2 trapping capacities in geological formations and sealing potentials of caprock highly depend on the specific thermo-physical condition. Thus, this novel data provides a significant advancement in literature and will aid in the implementation of hydrogen geo-storage at an industrial scale.",2021-09-21,2021,Muhammad Ali; Nurudeen Yekeen; Nilanjan Pal; Alireza Keshavarz; Stefan Iglauer,Curtin University,Energy Reports,188,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2021.09.016,Energy_Sustainability,Caprock; Stearic acid; Hydrogen; Wetting; Hydrogen storage,0.775

W4200353978,Assessing the role of compound drought and heatwave events on unprecedented 2020 wildfires in the Pantanal,"Abstract The year 2020 had the most catastrophic fire season over the last two decades in the Pantanal, which led to outstanding environmental impacts. Indeed, much of the Pantanal has been affected by severe dry conditions since 2019, with evidence of the 2020’s drought being the most extreme and widespread ever recorded in the last 70 years. Although it is unquestionable that this mega-drought contributed significantly to the increase of fire risk, so far, the 2020’s fire season has been analyzed at the univariate level of a single climate event, not considering the co-occurrence of extreme and persistent temperatures with soil dryness conditions. Here, we show that similarly to other areas of the globe, the influence of land-atmosphere feedbacks contributed decisively to the simultaneous occurrence of dry and hot spells (HPs), exacerbating fire risk. The ideal synoptic conditions for strong atmospheric heating and large evaporation rates were present, in particular during the HPs, when the maximum temperature was, on average, 6 °C above the normal. The short span of the period during those compound drought-heatwave (CDHW) events accounted for 55% of the burned area of 2020. The vulnerability in the northern forested areas was higher than in the other areas, revealing a synergistic effect between fuel availability and weather-hydrological conditions. Accordingly, where fuel is not a limiting factor, fire activity tends to be more modelled by CDHW events. Our work advances beyond an isolated event-level basis towards a compound and cascading natural hazards approach, simultaneously estimating the contribution of drought and heatwaves to fuelling extreme fire outbreaks in the Pantanal such as those in 2020. Thus, these findings are relevant within a broader context, as the driving mechanisms apply across other ecosystems, implying higher flammability conditions and further efforts for monitoring and predicting such extreme events.",2021-12-23,2021,Renata Libonati; João L.

W3166704773,Eco‐evolutionary optimality as a means to improve vegetation and land‐surface models,"Summary Global vegetation and land‐surface models embody interdisciplinary scientific understanding of the behaviour of plants and ecosystems, and are indispensable to project the impacts of environmental change on vegetation and the interactions between vegetation and climate. However, systematic errors and persistently large differences among carbon and water cycle projections by different models highlight the limitations of current process formulations. In this review, focusing on core plant functions in the terrestrial carbon and water cycles, we show how unifying hypotheses derived from eco‐evolutionary optimality (EEO) principles can provide novel, parameter‐sparse representations of plant and vegetation processes. We present case studies that demonstrate how EEO generates parsimonious representations of core, leaf‐level processes that are individually testable and supported by evidence. EEO approaches to photosynthesis and primary production, dark respiration and stomatal behaviour are ripe for implementation in global models. EEO approaches to other important traits, including the leaf economics spectrum and applications of EEO at the community level are active research areas. Independently tested modules emerging from EEO studies could profitably be integrated into modelling frameworks that account for the multiple time scales on which plants and plant communities adjust to environmental change.",2021-06-16,2021,Sandy P.

W4281249415,"Spatial distribution and risk assessments due to the microplastics pollution in sediments of Karnaphuli River Estuary, Bangladesh","Abstract Microplastics (MPs) have become an emerging global pollutant due to their widespread dispersion and potential threats to marine ecosystems. However, studies on MPs in estuarine and coastal ecosystems of Bangladesh are very limited. Here, we conducted the first study on abundance, distribution, characteristics, and risk assessment of microplastics in the sediment of Karnaphuli River estuary, Bangladesh. Microplastic particles were extracted from sediments of 30 stations along the estuary by density separation and then enumerated and characterized using a stereomicroscope and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. In the collected sediment of the Karnaphuli River estuary, the number of MPs varied from 22.29 to 59.5 items kg −1 of dry weight. The mean abundance was higher in the downstream and left banks of the estuary, whereas the predominant shape, colour, and size of MPs were films (35%), and white (19%), and 1–5 mm (30.38%), respectively. Major polymer types were polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, polyethylene, cellulose, and nylon. MPs were found to pose risks (low to high) in the sediment of the estuary, with the highest risk occurring at one station near a sewage outlet, according to the results of risk analyses using the pollution risk index, polymer risk index (H), contamination factors, and pollution load index (PLI). The single value index, PLI, clearly demonstrated that all sampling sites were considerably polluted with microplastics (PLI &gt; 1). H values showed toxic polymers, even in lower proportions, possess higher polymeric hazard scores and vice versa. This investigation uncovered new insights on the status of MPs in the sediments of the Karnaphuli River estuary, laying the groundwork for future research and control of microplastic pollution and management.",2022-05-20,2022,Md.

W3006174963,A catastrophic tropical drought kills hydraulically vulnerable tree species,"Abstract Drought‐related tree mortality is now a widespread phenomenon predicted to increase in magnitude with climate change. However, the patterns of which species and trees are most vulnerable to drought, and the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive, in part due to the lack of relevant data and difficulty of predicting the location of catastrophic drought years in advance. We used long‐term demographic records and extensive databases of functional traits and distribution patterns to understand the responses of 20–53 species to an extreme drought in a seasonally dry tropical forest in Costa Rica, which occurred during the 2015 El Niño Southern Oscillation event. Overall, species‐specific mortality rates during the drought ranged from 0% to 34%, and varied little as a function of tree size. By contrast, hydraulic safety margins correlated well with probability of mortality among species, while morphological or leaf economics spectrum traits did not. This firmly suggests hydraulic traits as targets for future research.",2020-02-13,2020,Jennifer S. Powers; German Vargas G.; Timothy J. Brodribb; Naomi B.

W3092642545,Ecosystem transpiration and evaporation: Insights from three water flux partitioning methods across FLUXNET sites,"We apply and compare three widely applicable methods for estimating ecosystem transpiration (T) from eddy covariance (EC) data across 251 FLUXNET sites globally. All three methods are based on the coupled water and carbon relationship, but they differ in assumptions and parameterizations. Intercomparison of the three daily T estimates shows high correlation among methods (R between .89 and .94), but a spread in magnitudes of T/ET (evapotranspiration) from 45% to 77%. When compared at six sites with concurrent EC and sap flow measurements, all three EC-based T estimates show higher correlation to sap flow-based T than EC-based ET. The partitioning methods show expected tendencies of T/ET increasing with dryness (vapor pressure deficit and days since rain) and with leaf area index (LAI). Analysis of 140 sites with high-quality estimates for at least two continuous years shows that T/ET variability was 1.6 times higher across sites than across years. Spatial variability of T/ET was primarily driven by vegetation and soil characteristics (e.g., crop or grass designation, minimum annual LAI, soil coarse fragment volume) rather than climatic variables such as mean/standard deviation of temperature or precipitation. Overall, T and T/ET patterns are plausible and qualitatively consistent among the different water flux partitioning methods implying a significant advance made for estimating and understanding T globally, while the magnitudes remain uncertain. Our results represent the first extensive EC data-based estimates of ecosystem T permitting a data-driven perspective on the role of plants' water use for global water and carbon cycling in a changing climate.",2020-10-06,2020,Jacob A.

W4206995827,Algae-mediated antibiotic wastewater treatment: A critical review,"The existence of continually increasing concentrations of antibiotics in the environment is a serious potential hazard due to their toxicity and persistence. Unfortunately, conventional treatment techniques, such as those utilized in wastewater treatment plants, are not efficient for the treatment of wastewater containing antibiotic. Recently, algae-based technologies have been found to be a sustainable and promising technique for antibiotic removal. Therefore, this review aims to provide a critical summary of algae-based technologies and their important role in antibiotic wastewater treatment. Algal removal mechanisms including bioadsorption, bioaccumulation, and biodegradation are discussed in detail, with using algae-bacteria consortia for antibiotic treatment, integration of algae with other microorganisms (fungi and multiple algal species), hybrid algae-based treatment and constructed wetlands, and the factors affecting algal antibiotic degradation comprehensively described and assessed. In addition, the use of algae as a precursor for the production of biochar is highlighted, along with the modification of biochar with other materials to improve its antibiotic removal capacity and hybrid algae-based treatment with advanced oxidation processes. Furthermore, recent novel approaches for enhancing antibiotic removal, such as the use of genetic engineering to enhance the antibiotic degradation capacity of algae and the integration of algal antibiotic removal with bioelectrochemical systems are discussed. Finally, some based on the critical review, key future research perspectives are proposed. Overall, this review systematically presents the current progress in algae-mediated antibiotic removal technologies, providing some novel insights for improved alleviation of antibiotic pollution in aquatic environments.",2022-01-01,2022,Shengnan Li; Pau Loke Show; Huu Hao Ngo; Shih‐Hsin Ho,University of Technology Sydney,Environmental Science and Ecotechnology,185,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ese.2022.100145,Energy_Sustainability,Algae; Sewage treatment; Antibiotics; Wastewater; Biology,0.283
W4211219306,Overview of the MOSAiC expedition: Physical oceanography,"Arctic Ocean properties and processes are highly relevant to the regional and global coupled climate system, yet still scarcely observed, especially in winter. Team OCEAN conducted a full year of physical oceanography observations as part of the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of the Arctic Climate (MOSAiC), a drift with the Arctic sea ice from October 2019 to September 2020. An international team designed and implemented the program to characterize the Arctic Ocean system in unprecedented detail, from the seafloor to the air-sea ice-ocean interface, from sub-mesoscales to pan-Arctic. The oceanographic measurements were coordinated with the other teams to explore the ocean physics and linkages to the climate and ecosystem. This paper introduces the major components of the physical oceanography program and complements the other team overviews of the MOSAiC observational program. Team OCEAN’s sampling strategy was designed around hydrographic ship-, ice- and autonomous platform-based measurements to improve the understanding of regional circulation and mixing processes. Measurements were carried out both routinely, with a regular schedule, and in response to storms or opening leads. Here we present along-drift time series of hydrographic properties, allowing insights into the seasonal and regional evolution of the water column from winter in the Laptev Sea to early summer in Fram Strait: freshening of the surface, deepening of the mixed layer, increase in temperature and salinity of the Atlantic Water. We also highlight the presence of Canada Basin deep water intrusions and a surface meltwater layer in leads. MOSAiC most likely was the most comprehensive program ever conducted over the ice-covered Arctic Ocean. While data analysis and interpretation are ongoing, the acquired datasets will support a wide range of physical oceanography and multi-disciplinary research. They will provide a significant foundation for assessing and advancing modeling capabilities in the Arctic Ocean.",2022-01-01,2022,Benjamin Rabe; Céline Heuzé; Julia Regnery; Yevgeny Aksenov; Jacob Allerholt,University of Tasmania,Elementa Science of the Anthropocene,185,https://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.2021.00062,Energy_Sustainability,Oceanography; Hydrography; Sea ice; Arctic; Physical oceanography,0.583
W4319915600,Silver lining to a climate crisis in multiple prospects for alleviating crop waterlogging under future climates,"Extreme weather events threaten food security, yet global assessments of impacts caused by crop waterlogging are rare. Here we first develop a paradigm that distils common stress patterns across environments, genotypes and climate horizons. Second, we embed improved process-based understanding into a farming systems model to discern changes in global crop waterlogging under future climates. Third, we develop avenues for adapting cropping systems to waterlogging contextualised by environment. We find that yield penalties caused by waterlogging increase from 3-11% historically to 10-20% by 2080, with penalties reflecting a trade-off between the duration of waterlogging and the timing of waterlogging relative to crop stage. We document greater potential for waterlogging-tolerant genotypes in environments with longer temperate growing seasons (e.g., UK, France, Russia, China), compared with environments with higher annualised ratios of evapotranspiration to precipitation (e.g., Australia). Under future climates, altering sowing time and adoption of waterlogging-tolerant genotypes reduces yield penalties by 18%, while earlier sowing of winter genotypes alleviates waterlogging by 8%. We highlight the serendipitous outcome wherein waterlogging stress patterns under present conditions are likely to be similar to those in the future, suggesting that adaptations for future climates could be designed using stress patterns realised today.",2023-02-10,2023,Ke Liu; Matthew Tom Harrison; Hàoliàng Yán; De Li Liu; Holger Meinke,University of Tasmania,Nature Communications,185,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36129-4,Energy_Sustainability,Waterlogging (archaeology); Temperate climate; Climate change; Food security; Environmental science,0.433
W3045845471,The role of shared autonomous vehicle systems in delivering smart urban mobility: A systematic review of the literature,"Emerging autonomous driving technologies are claimed to create new opportunities for realizing smart and sustainable urban mobility initiatives. In this perspective, some studies identified shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) as being a crucial element of on-demand mobility services. There is, however, limited evidence from practice on what roles SAVs play in delivering smart urban mobility. In other words, SAV in the context of smart urban mobility is an understudied area of research with limited review studies. To bridge this gap in the literature, this study aims to investigate and map out the service attributes and impacts of SAVs on urban mobility, infrastructure and land use, travel behavior, and the environment. As the methodological approach, the paper adopts the systematic literature review technique. The study findings reveal that: (a) Providing dynamic ridesharing services could result in significant reduction of SAV fleet size, congestion, travel cost, parking demand, vehicle ownership, and emissions; (b) Positive environmental outcomes could be enhanced with full electrification of SAV fleet through renewable energy charging; (c) Integration of SAV, as a smart urban mobility system with dynamic ridesharing services, could promote sustainability and social and transportation equity, and their adoption. In the light of the findings, this study advocates the consolidation of urban/transport policy to achieve desired urban mobility outcomes.",2020-07-28,2020,Fahimeh Golbabaei; Tan Yiğitcanlar; Jonathan M.

W2997680695,Illuminating water cycle modifications and Earth system resilience in the Anthropocene,"Abstract Fresh water—the bloodstream of the biosphere—is at the center of the planetary drama of the Anthropocene. Water fluxes and stores regulate the Earth's climate and are essential for thriving aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as water, food, and energy security. But the water cycle is also being modified by humans at an unprecedented scale and rate. A holistic understanding of freshwater's role for Earth system resilience and the detection and monitoring of anthropogenic water cycle modifications across scales is urgent, yet existing methods and frameworks are not well suited for this. In this paper we highlight four core Earth system functions of water (hydroclimatic regulation, hydroecological regulation, storage, and transport) and key related processes. Building on systems and resilience theory, we review the evidence of regional‐scale regime shifts and disruptions of the Earth system functions of water. We then propose a framework for detecting, monitoring, and establishing safe limits to water cycle modifications and identify four possible spatially explicit methods for their quantification. In sum, this paper presents an ambitious scientific and policy grand challenge that could substantially improve our understanding of the role of water in the Earth system and cross‐scale management of water cycle modifications that would be a complementary approach to existing water management tools.",2020-01-04,2020,Tom Gleeson; Lan Wang‐Erlandsson; Miina Porkka; Samuel C.

W3011591149,Components of leaf‐trait variation along environmental gradients,"Leaf area (LA), mass per area (LMA), nitrogen per unit area (Narea ) and the leaf-internal to ambient CO2 ratio (χ) are fundamental traits for plant functional ecology and vegetation modelling. Here we aimed to assess how their variation, within and between species, tracks environmental gradients. Measurements were made on 705 species from 116 sites within a broad north-south transect from tropical to temperate Australia. Trait responses to environment were quantified using multiple regression; within- and between-species responses were compared using analysis of covariance and trait-gradient analysis. Leaf area, the leaf economics spectrum (indexed by LMA and Narea ) and χ (from stable carbon isotope ratios) varied almost independently among species. Across sites, however, χ and LA increased with mean growing-season temperature (mGDD0 ) and decreased with vapour pressure deficit (mVPD0 ) and soil pH. LMA and Narea showed the reverse pattern. Climate responses agreed with expectations based on optimality principles. Within-species variability contributed < 10% to geographical variation in LA but > 90% for χ, with LMA and Narea intermediate. These findings support the hypothesis that acclimation within individuals, adaptation within species and selection among species combine to create predictable relationships between traits and environment. However, the contribution of acclimation/adaptation vs species selection differs among traits.",2020-03-21,2020,Ning Dong; I. Colin Prentice; Ian J.

W3015269922,Climate-Smart Forestry: the missing link,"To achieve the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement, a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is needed, as well as increased removals by carbon sinks. In this context, we argue that Climate-Smart Forestry is a necessary, but still missing component in national strategies for implementing actions under the Paris Agreement. Climate-Smart Forestry is needed to (a) increase the total forest area and avoid deforestation, (b) connect mitigation with adaption measures to enhance the resilience of global forest resources, and (c) use wood for products that store carbon and substitute emission-intensive fossil and non-renewable products and materials. Successful Climate-Smart Forestry has important policy implications on finding the right balance between short and long-term goals, as well as between the need for wood production, the protection of biodiversity and the provision of other important ecosystem services. CSF thus can provide important co-benefits that are increasingly being recognized as essential for sustainable well-being.",2020-04-12,2020,Pieter Johannes Verkerk; Robert Costanza; Lauri Hetemäki; Ida Kubiszewski; P.

W3105060452,The quest for improved air quality may push China to continue its CO <sub>2</sub> reduction beyond the Paris Commitment,"Significance Pathways for China to achieve its dual targets of air quality and CO 2 mitigation in 2035 were investigated through a newly developed evaluation framework coupling integrated assessment and air quality models. Results indicate that the low-carbon energy policies, traditionally regarded as a primary result of climate mitigation, are likely driven more by the efforts on air quality attainment in China. To achieve air quality attainment in China could lead to more reduction in CO 2 emissions than its Nationally Determined Contribution. In addition, stronger low-carbon policies will bring significant benefits to public health via improvements in air quality. This study also provides a valuable reference for other developing countries to address their duel challenges of climate change and air pollution.",2020-11-09,2020,Jia Xing; Xi Lu; Shuxiao Wang; Tong Wang; Dian Ding,Queensland University of Technology,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,182,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2013297117,Energy_Sustainability,Air quality index; China; Air pollution; Dual (grammatical number); Climate change,0.55
W3204160106,Variation of lignocellulosic biomass structure from torrefaction: A critical review,"In recent years, torrefaction, a kind of biomass thermal pretreatment technology, has received a great deal of attention due to its effective upgrading performance of biomass. Recent studies have also suggested that the quality of syngas and bio-oil (or biocrude) from the pyrolysis, gasification, and liquefaction of torrefied biomass can be effectively improved. Torrefaction changes the structure of the biomass, the degree of this change depends strongly on the severity of the torrefaction process. To have a better understanding of the impact that torrefaction has on the biomass structure, this study aims to provide a comprehensive and in-depth review of recent advances on this topic. Particular attention is paid to biomass structure analysis through thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared analysis, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance. From these analyses, the thermal degradation characteristics of hemicelluloses, cellulose, lignin, and other components in biomass can be recognized. In addition to the elaboration of biomass structure variation from torrefaction, future challenges and perspectives are also underlined. The insights provided in this review are conducive to the further applications of biomass torrefaction for sustainable biofuel production.",2021-09-28,2021,Hwai Chyuan Ong; Kai Yu; Wei‐Hsin Chen; Ma.

W3134646072,Systemic effects of rising atmospheric vapor pressure deficit on plant physiology and productivity,"Abstract Earth is currently undergoing a global increase in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD), a trend which is expected to continue as climate warms. This phenomenon has been associated with productivity decreases in ecosystems and yield penalties in crops, with these losses attributed to photosynthetic limitations arising from decreased stomatal conductance. Such VPD increases, however, have occurred over decades, which raises the possibility that stomatal acclimation to VPD plays an important role in determining plant productivity under high VPD. Furthermore, evidence points to more far‐ranging and complex effects of elevated VPD on plant physiology, extending to the anatomical, biochemical, and developmental levels, which could vary substantially across species. Because these complex effects are typically not considered in modeling frameworks, we conducted a quantitative literature review documenting temperature‐independent VPD effects on 112 species and 59 traits and physiological variables, in order to develop an integrated and mechanistic physiological framework. We found that VPD increase reduced yield and primary productivity, an effect that was partially mediated by stomatal acclimation, and also linked with changes in leaf anatomy, nutrient, and hormonal status. The productivity decrease was also associated with negative effects on reproductive development, and changes in architecture and growth rates that could decrease the evaporative surface or minimize embolism risk. Cross‐species quantitative relationships were found between levels of VPD increase and trait responses, and we found differences across plant groups, indicating that future VPD impacts will depend on community assembly and crop functional diversity. Our analysis confirms predictions arising from the hydraulic corollary to Darcy's law, outlines a systemic physiological framework of plant responses to rising VPD, and provides recommendations for future research to better understand and mitigate VPD‐mediated climate change effects on ecosystems and agro‐systems.",2021-03-08,2021,José R.

This paper aims to provide a review on the environmental assessment of using biopolymers as binders in soil improvement, biopolymer-treated soil characteristics, as well as the most important factors affecting the behavior of the treated soil. In more detail, environmental benefits and concerns about the use of biopolymers in soil improvement as well as biopolymer–soil interaction are discussed. Various geotechnical properties are evaluated and compared, including the unconfined compressive strength, shear strength, erosion resistance, physical properties, and durability of biopolymer-treated soils. The influential factors and soil and environmental conditions affecting various geotechnical characteristics of biopolymer-treated soils are also discussed. These factors include biopolymer concentration in the biopolymer–soil mixture, moisture condition, temperature, and dehydration time. Potential opportunities for biopolymers in geotechnical engineering and the challenges are also presented.",2021-07-15,2021,Hadi Fatehi; Dominic Ek Leong Ong; Qi Yu; Ilhan Chang,Griffith University,Geosciences,181,https://doi.org/10.3390/geosciences11070291,Energy_Sustainability,Biopolymer; Geotechnical engineering; Soil water; Environmental science; Soil stabilization,0.208
W4311255578,A review of hydrogen/rock/brine interaction: Implications for Hydrogen Geo-storage,"Hydrogen (H2) is currently considered a clean fuel to decrease anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and will play a vital role in climate change mitigation. Nevertheless, one of the primary challenges of achieving a complete H2 economy is the large-scale storage of H2, which is unsafe on the surface because H2 is highly compressible, volatile, and flammable. Hydrogen storage in geological formations could be a potential solution to this problem because of the abundance of such formations and their high storage capacities. Wettability plays a critical role in the displacement of formation water and determines the containment safety, storage capacity, and amount of trapped H2 (or recovery factor). However, no comprehensive review article has been published explaining H2 wettability in geological conditions. Therefore, this review focuses on the influence of various parameters, such as salinity, temperature, pressure, surface roughness, and formation type, on wettability and, consequently, H2 storage. Significant gaps exist in the literature on understanding the effect of organic material on H2 storage capacity. Thus, this review summarizes recent advances in rock/H2/brine systems containing organic material in various geological reservoirs. The paper also presents influential parameters affecting H2 storage capacity and containment safety, including liquid–gas interfacial tension, rock–fluid interfacial tension, and adsorption. The paper aims to provide the scientific community with an expert opinion to understand the challenges of H2 storage and identify storage solutions. In addition, the essential differences between underground H2 storage (UHS), natural gas storage, and carbon dioxide geological storage are discussed, and the direction of future research is presented. Therefore, this review promotes thorough knowledge of UHS, provides guidance on operating large-scale UHS projects, encourages climate engineers to focus more on UHS research, and provides an overview of advanced technology. This review also inspires researchers in the field of climate change to give more credit to UHS studies.",2022-12-10,2022,Masoud Aslannezhad; Muhammad Ali; Azim Kalantariasl; Mohammad Sayyafzadeh; Zhenjiang You,Edith Cowan University,Progress in Energy and Combustion Science,181,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pecs.2022.101066,Energy_Sustainability,Brine; Hydrogen storage; Environmental science; Petroleum engineering; Greenhouse gas,0.55
W4319339192,Why Are Invasive Plants Successful?,"Plant invasions, a byproduct of globalization, are increasing worldwide. Because of their ecological and economic impacts, considerable efforts have been made to understand and predict the success of non-native plants. Numerous frameworks, hypotheses, and theories have been advanced to conceptualize the interactions of multiple drivers and context dependence of invasion success with the aim of achieving robust explanations with predictive power. We review these efforts from a community-level perspective rather than a biogeographical one, focusing on terrestrial systems, and explore the roles of intrinsic plant properties in determining species invasiveness, as well as the effects of biotic and abiotic conditions in mediating ecosystem invasibility (or resistance) and ecological and evolutionary processes. We also consider the fundamental influences of human-induced changes at scales ranging from local to global in triggering, promoting, and sustaining plant invasions and discuss how these changes could alter future invasion trajectories.",2023-02-08,2023,Margherita Gioria; Philip E.

W3203618031,A Review of Hydrogen as a Fuel in Internal Combustion Engines,"The demand for fossil fuels is increasing because of globalization and rising energy demands. As a result, many nations are exploring alternative energy sources, and hydrogen is an efficient and practical alternative fuel. In the transportation industry, the development of hydrogen-powered cars aims to maximize fuel efficiency and significantly reduce exhaust gas emission and concentration. The impact of using hydrogen as a supplementary fuel for spark ignition (SI) and compression ignition (CI) engines on engine performance and gas emissions was investigated in this study. By adding hydrogen as a fuel in internal combustion engines, the torque, power, and brake thermal efficiency of the engines decrease, while their brake-specific fuel consumption increase. This study suggests that using hydrogen will reduce the emissions of CO, UHC, CO2, and soot; however, NOx emission is expected to increase. Due to the reduction of environmental pollutants for most engines and the related environmental benefits, hydrogen fuel is a clean and sustainable energy source, and its use should be expanded.",2021-09-29,2021,Behdad Shadidi; Gholamhassan Najafi; Talal Yusaf,Central Queensland University,Energies,180,https://doi.org/10.3390/en14196209,Energy_Sustainability,Hydrogen fuel enhancement; Brake specific fuel consumption; Hydrogen fuel; Internal combustion engine; Combustion,0.7

W3009627224,Decentralized Privacy Using Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning in Fog Computing,"As the extension of cloud computing and a foundation of IoT, fog computing is experiencing fast prosperity because of its potential to mitigate some troublesome issues, such as network congestion, latency, and local autonomy. However, privacy issues and the subsequent inefficiency are dragging down the performances of fog computing. The majority of existing works hardly consider a reasonable balance between them while suffering from poisoning attacks. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel blockchain-enabled federated learning (FL-Block) scheme to close the gap. FL-Block allows local learning updates of end devices exchanges with a blockchain-based global learning model, which is verified by miners. Built upon this, FL-Block enables the autonomous machine learning without any centralized authority to maintain the global model and coordinates by using a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism of the blockchain. Furthermore, we analyze the latency performance of FL-Block and further derive the optimal block generation rate by taking communication, consensus delays, and computation cost into consideration. Extensive evaluation results show the superior performances of FL-Block from the aspects of privacy protection, efficiency, and resistance to the poisoning attack.",2020-03-02,2020,Youyang Qu; Longxiang Gao; Tom H.

It examines both short-term and medium-to-long-term impacts of the pandemic and outlines strategies to reduce the potential consequences of those impacts. To this end, we use a qualitative, multiple-case-study methodology, collecting data from eight sample companies with fourteen respondents in the food and beverage industry in Bangladesh. The findings show that the short-term impacts of this pandemic, such as product expiry, shortage of working capital, and limited operations of distributors, are severe, while the medium-to-long-term impacts promise to be complex and uncertain. In the longer term, various performance metrics, such as return on investment by the firms, the contribution of the firms to the gross domestic product (GDP), and employee size, are all expected to decrease. Moreover, firms may need to restructure their supply chain and build relationships with new distributors and trade partners. The study proposes several strategies that managers in this sector can adopt to improve resiliency in the changing environment during and after the COVID-19 era. While this research is novel and contributes to both theory and practice, it does not consider small and medium-sized companies in the food and beverage industry.

To facilitate and improve the utilization of ES, appropriate system design and operational strategies should be adopted. The traditional approach of utilizing ES is the individual distributed framework in which an individual ES is installed for each user separately. Due to the cost inefficiency of the individual framework and the difficulty of applying this framework to the grid-scale ES, many studies have suggested the sharing strategy for the utilization of ES to further exploit the potentials of ES. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the papers on shared ES that are published in the last decade. In this review, we characterize the design of the shared ES systems and explain their potential and challenges. We also provide a detailed comparison of the literature on shared ES based on multiple criteria.

W3016560828,Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning in Fog Computing,"Federated learning can combine a large number of scattered user groups and train models collaboratively without uploading data sets, so as to avoid the server collecting user sensitive data. However, the model of federated learning will expose the training set information of users, and the uneven amount of data owned by users in multiple users' scenarios will lead to the inefficiency of training. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning scheme in fog computing. Acting as a participant, each fog node is enabled to collect Internet-of-Things (IoT) device data and complete the learning task in our scheme. Such design effectively improves the low training efficiency and model accuracy caused by the uneven distribution of data and the large gap of computing power. We enable IoT device data to satisfy ε -differential privacy to resist data attacks and leverage the combination of blinding and Paillier homomorphic encryption against model attacks, which realize the security aggregation of model parameters. In addition, we formally verified our scheme can not only guarantee both data security and model security but completely resist collusion attacks launched by multiple malicious entities.

This study draws on the scarcity principle, crowd psychology and contagion theory to investigate the antecedents and consequences of panic buying. The antecedents included in this study are government measures, media and peer influence and the fear of missing out. The consequences are founded on a sense of security and guilt. Retailer intervention is included as a moderator to the proposed main effects. Data were collected from 341 consumers who engaged in panic buying and were residents of the United States and Australia during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Structural equation modelling was employed to test the proposed model. The results show that the proposed antecedents (except fear of missing out) were significantly related to panic buying, which in turn had a significant influence on panic buyers' psychological outcomes.

W3041614001,Strategies for Managing the Impacts of Disruptions During COVID-19: an Example of Toilet Paper,"Due to the recent pandemic of coronavirus, known as the COVID-19 outbreak, the supply chains have been impacted most significantly. Manufacturers of certain items have experienced a substantial increase in demand, and on the other hand, raw materials supply, to produce those items, has reduced because of supply failure. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes some strategies to improve service level during an extraordinary pandemic outbreak, such as COVID-19, for the most wanted products such as toilet paper. This study considers meeting the increased demand of the customers for an essential product of daily life like toilet paper during a pandemic is beyond the traditional economic objective, i.e., increase profit, of the manufacturers. Instead, this should be more about the social responsibility of all the manufactures to ensure that they can serve more customers. Motivated by this and taking toilet paper as an example of the product, we first analyzed the current scenario of the manufacturing and the demand for the product and then proposed some strategies to deal with this unprecedented risk and analyzed the results. We have compared the results, using hypothetical data, between the current scenario and proposed strategies. The result shows that sharing information and resources from all manufacturers to produce under a single brand, emergency sourcing, producing basic quality items, and packing in the smallest sizes have a significant positive impact on the service level.

W3046677190,Urban mobility and public transport: future perspectives and review,"The purpose of this work is to review urban transportation likely to be offered in the future. Trip-making behaviour has already changed considerably as lifestyles change and they will continue to change in the future. This work reflects and places emphasis on profound thinking about the possibilities, rather than predicting them. Thoughts about possibilities for the future draw upon imagination, perceived and justified feasibility, and lessons gained from the past. This work attempts to capture the possibilities, logistics and travel modes of future urban transportation. A visionary, feasibility-related approach grounded in a realist perspective is proposed, only conceptually, to explore plausible visions for the future. In addition, this work shows the inefficiency of using private cars (PCs) and argues that in the development of autonomous and electric vehicles, PCs cannot provide a solution competitive with the potential that urban transportation systems have for the future. Hence, the solutions for the future must be based on public transport (PT) modes of travel, regardless of whether they are metro, bus, light rail, tram, ridesharing services, an ordinary taxi, personal rapid transit, or any other PT-based future mode. The key principal of operation for the mobility of a smart city will be the ability to optimize the connectivity of movement in order to approach a seamless move, while endowing the phrase door-to-door travel with new meaning. Finally, it would be remiss not to mention the unforeseeable implications of the Covid-19 pandemic for future mobility, more controllable by automation of non-privately owned vehicle, and with the prospect of people demonstrating a greater inclination towards changing their habits, behaviour, and thinking paradigms.",2020-07-29,2020,Avishai Ceder,University of Auckland,International Journal of Urban Sciences,184,https://doi.org/10.1080/12265934.2020.1799846,Advanced_Manufacturing,Public transport; Vision; Work (physics); Inefficiency; Transport engineering,0.642
W3193525039,Interventions for health workforce retention in rural and remote areas: a systematic review,"Abstract Background Attracting and retaining sufficient health workers to provide adequate services for residents of rural and remote areas has global significance. High income countries (HICs) face challenges in staffing rural areas, which are often perceived by health workers as less attractive workplaces. The objective of this review was to examine the quantifiable associations between interventions to retain health workers in rural and remote areas of HICs, and workforce retention. Methods The review considers studies of rural or remote health workers in HICs where participants have experienced interventions, support measures or incentive programs intended to increase retention. Experimental, quasi-experimental and observational study designs including cohort, case–control, cross-sectional and case series studies published since 2010 were eligible for inclusion. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for reviews of risk and aetiology was used. Databases searched included MEDLINE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, Web of Science and Informit. Results Of 2649 identified articles, 34 were included, with a total of 58,188 participants. All study designs were observational, limiting certainty of findings. Evidence relating to the retention of non-medical health professionals was scant. There is growing evidence that preferential selection of students who grew up in a rural area is associated with increased rural retention. Undertaking substantial lengths of rural training during basic university training or during post-graduate training were each associated with higher rural retention, as was supporting existing rural health professionals to extend their skills or upgrade their qualifications. Regulatory interventions requiring return-of-service (ROS) in a rural area in exchange for visa waivers, access to professional licenses or provider numbers were associated with comparatively low rural retention, especially once the ROS period was complete. Rural retention was higher if ROS was in exchange for loan repayments. Conclusion Educational interventions such as preferential selection of rural students and distributed training in rural areas are associated with increased rural retention of health professionals. Strongly coercive interventions are associated with comparatively lower rural retention than interventions that involve less coercion. Policy makers seeking rural retention in the medium and longer term would be prudent to strengthen rural training pathways and limit the use of strongly coercive interventions.",2021-08-26,2021,Deborah Russell; Supriya Mathew; Michelle S.

W4213354866,"Reduction of CO2 emissions: The role of renewable energy, technological innovation and export quality","In the 22 well-developed countries of the world, the level of CO2 emissions has been reducing over the years despite positive economic growth. This study therefore attempts to explore the role of contributory factors for CO2 emissions reduction in these countries. Selecting the data period of 1990–2018, our chosen independent variables are gross domestic product (GDP), square of the gross domestic product (GDP2), renewable energy, technological innovation and export quality. Adopting a panel non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) approach, a pooled mean group (PMG) estimation technique is used to explore the asymmetric linkages between CO2 emissions and these independent variables. The panel heterogeneous causality test is used to examine the direction of causality. The estimated results have confirmed the existence of environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis; and renewable energy and export quality are found as contributory factors for the reduction of CO2 emissions. Positive stimuli of technological innovation measured by research and development expenditure and export quality index reduce, whereas the negative shocks or counter incentives of these variables increase CO2 emissions. In regards to causal relationship, bidirectional causality is found between renewable energy and CO2 emissions, technological innovation and CO2 emissions, GDP and renewable energy, and renewable energy and technological innovation. In addition, a unidirectional causality is also revealed from GDP to CO2 emissions, export quality and technological innovation, and from technological innovation to export quality. Policy recommendations are made following the findings.",2022-02-14,2022,Mohammad Mafizur Rahman; Khosrul Alam; Eswaran Velayutham,University of Southern Queensland,Energy Reports,160,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2022.01.200,Advanced_Manufacturing,Kuznets curve; Economics; Renewable energy; Gross domestic product; Distributed lag,0.375
W3132823556,EIHDP: Edge-Intelligent Hierarchical Dynamic Pricing Based on Cloud-Edge-Client Collaboration for IoT Systems,"Nowadays, IoT systems can better satisfy the service requirements of users with effectively utilizing edge computing resources. Designing an appropriate pricing scheme is critical for users to obtain the optimal computing resources at a reasonable price and for service providers to maximize profits. This problem is complicated with incomplete information. The state-of-the-art solutions focus on the pricing game between a single service provider and users, which ignoring the competition among multiple edge service providers. To address this challenge, we design an edge-intelligent hierarchical dynamic pricing mechanism based on cloud-edge-client collaboration. We introduce an improved double-layer Stackelberg game model to describe the cloud-edge-client collaboration. Technically, we propose a novel pricing prediction algorithm based on double-label Radius K-nearest Neighbors, thereby reducing the number of invalid games to accelerate the game convergence. The experimental results show that our proposed mechanism effectively improves the quality of service for users and realizes the maximum benefit equilibrium for service providers, compared with the traditional pricing scheme. Our proposed mechanism is highly suitable for the IoT applications (e.g., intelligent agriculture or Internet of Vehicles), where there are multiple competing edge service providers for resource allocation.",2021-02-20,2021,Tian Wang; Yucheng Lu; Jianhuang Wang; Hong‐Ning Dai; Xi Zheng,Macquarie University,IEEE Transactions on Computers,127,https://doi.org/10.1109/tc.2021.3060484,Advanced_Manufacturing,Computer science; Stackelberg competition; Cloud computing; Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution; Service provider,0.15
W3171973514,Deep Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence Techniques Applied for Detecting Money Laundering–A Critical Review,"Money laundering has been a global issue for decades, which is one of the major threat for economy and society. Government, regulatory and financial institutions are combating it together in their respective capacity, however still billions of dollars in fines by authorities make the headlines in the news. High-speed internet services have enabled financial institutions to deliver better customer experience through multi-channel engagements, which has led to exponential growth in transactions and new avenues for laundering the money for fraudsters. Literature shows the usage of statistical methods, data mining and Machine Learning (ML) techniques for money laundering detection, but limited research on Deep Learning (DL) techniques, primarily due to lack of model interpretability and explainability of the decisions made. Several studies are conducted on application of ML for Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques in general, but lacks the study on usage of DL techniques together with XAI. This paper aims to review the current state-of-the-art literature on DL together with XAI for identifying suspicious money laundering transactions and identify future research areas. Key findings of the review are, researchers have preferred variants of Convolutional Neural Networks, and AutoEncoder; graph deep learning together with natural language processing is emerging as an important technology for AML; XAI use is not seen in AML domain; 51% ML methods used in AML are non-interpretable, 58% studies used sample of old real data; key challenges for researchers are access to recent real transaction data and scarcity of labelled training data; and data being highly imbalanced. Future research directions are, application of XAI techniques to bring-out explainability, graph deep learning using natural language processing (NLP), unsupervised and reinforcement learning to handle lack of labelled data; and joint research programs between research community and industry to benefit from domain knowledge and controlled access to data.",2021-01-01,2021,Dattatray Vishnu Kute; Biswajeet Pradhan; Nagesh Shukla; Abdullah Alamri,University of Technology Sydney,IEEE Access,118,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3086230,Advanced_Manufacturing,Money laundering; Computer science; Database transaction; Big data; Artificial intelligence,0.358
W4381741038,The impacts of under-tourism and place attachment on residents’ life satisfaction,"The tourism industry is highly sensitive to negative environmental factors, as can be seen in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, when many countries and regions shifted from over-tourism to under-tourism, resulting in the continuation of multiple serious impacts on destinations. To systematically reveal the specific impacts of under-tourism on tourism destinations, this study aims to (a) understand the impact of resident perceptions of under-tourism; (b) investigate the relationship between place attachment and resident perceptions of under-tourism, and (c) examine the relationships between the resident perception of under-tourism and life satisfaction. The perceived impacts of under-tourism are subdivided into positive economic impact, negative economic impact, positive social impact, negative social impact, and positive environmental impact, based on the triple bottom line and social exchange theory. The research was conducted with the involvement of 296 local residents and foreign workers in Macau. The findings show that place attachment has a positive impact on their perceived positive economic impact and positive social impact. Resident perceptions of positive economic impact, positive social impact, and positive environmental impact have a positive influence on their satisfaction with life, and negative economic impact and negative social impact have a negative influence on their satisfaction. Using the results of this study we expand the literature on social exchange theory in tourism, broaden the theory of resident perceptions of impact, and also provide relevant practical suggestions for destinations to recover and maintain sustainable development based on tourism.",2023-06-22,2023,Chen-Kuo Pai; Haoran Chen; Timothy J.

W3187161146,Distributed Path Following of Multiple Under-Actuated Autonomous Surface Vehicles Based on Data-Driven Neural Predictors via Integral Concurrent Learning,"This article addresses the problem of distributed path following of multiple under-actuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with completely unknown kinetic models. An integrated distributed guidance and learning control architecture is proposed for achieving a time-varying formation. Specifically, a robust distributed guidance law at the kinematic level is developed based on a consensus approach, a path-following mechanism, and an extended state observer. At the kinetic level, a model-free kinetic control law based on data-driven neural predictors via integral concurrent learning is designed such that the kinetic model can be learned by using recorded data. The advantage of the proposed method is two-folds. First, the proposed formation controllers are able to achieve various time-varying formations without using the velocities of neighboring vehicles. Second, the proposed control law is model-free without any parameter information on kinetic models. Simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed robust distributed guidance and model-free control laws for multiple under-actuated ASVs with fully unknown kinetic models.",2021-08-06,2021,Lu Liu; Dan Wang; Zhouhua Peng; Qing‐Long Han,Swinburne University of Technology,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,116,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2021.3100147,Advanced_Manufacturing,Kinematics; Observer (physics); Control theory (sociology); Computer science; Path (computing),0.375
W3154796165,CoopEdge: A Decentralized Blockchain-based Platform for Cooperative Edge Computing,"Edge computing (EC) has recently emerged as a novel computing paradigm that offers users low-latency services. Suffering from constrained computing resources due to their limited physical sizes, edge servers cannot always handle all the incoming computation tasks timely when they operate independently. They often need to cooperate through peer-offloading. Deployed and managed by different stakeholders, edge servers operate in a distrusted environment. Trust and incentive are the two main issues that challenge cooperative computing between them. Another unique challenge in the EC environment is to facilitate trust and incentive in a decentralized manner. To tackle these challenges systematically, this paper proposes CoopEdge, a novel blockchain-based decentralized platform, to drive and support cooperative edge computing. On CoopEdge, an edge server can publish a computation task for other edge servers to contend for. A winner is selected from candidate edge servers based on their reputations. After that, a consensus is reached among edge servers to record the performance in task execution on blockchain. We implement CoopEdge based on Hyperledger Sawtooth and evaluate it experimentally against a baseline and two state-of-the-art implementations in a simulated EC environment. The results validate the usefulness of CoopEdge and demonstrate its performance.",2021-04-19,2021,Yuan Liang; Qiang He; Siyu Tan; Bo Li; Jiangshan Yu,Swinburne University of Technology,,115,https://doi.org/10.1145/3442381.3449994,Advanced_Manufacturing,Server; Computer science; Edge computing; Distributed computing; Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution,0.3

W4283697438,Sustainable Supply Chain Management: A Comprehensive Systematic Review of Industrial Practices,"Sustainable business practices are those that allow companies to increase their profit while still considering the triple bottom line of sustainability, which involves economic, environmental, and social aspects. There are a lot of studies exploring various aspects of supply chain practices. However, there remains a gap for the proposal of a complete framework concerning various industries. This research fills this gap by studying existing empirical and review studies. Based on a content analysis of 86 studies, 789 practices are derived and categorized, leading to a comprehensive classification of sustainable practices in supply chains. Moreover, the employed methods to analyze the data are investigated. The practices are cross-checked versus the studied industries showing the current sustainable industries. The details of the studied papers are presented in a comprehensive table. The sustainable framework showing the industrial solutions toward sustainable supply chains is divided into 38 minor practices classified into 11 main categories. This paper provides a novel interpretation of the sustainable solutions addressed by different industries and presents a new and updated classification of the literature identifying future directions.

W4293057993,MetaChain: A Novel Blockchain-based Framework for Metaverse Applications,"Metaverse has recently attracted paramount attention due to its potential for future Internet. However, to fully realize such potential, Metaverse applications have to overcome various challenges such as massive resource demands, interoperability among applications, and security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose MetaChain, a novel blockchain-based framework to address emerging challenges for the development of Metaverse applications. In particular, by utilizing the smart contract mechanism, MetaChain can effectively manage and automate complex interactions among the Metaverse Service Provider (MSP) and the Metaverse users (MUs). In addition, to allow the MSP to efficiently allocate its resources for Metaverse applications and MUs' demands, we design a novel sharding scheme to improve the underlying blockchain's scalability. Moreover, to leverage MUs' resources as well as to attract more MUs to support Metaverse operations, we develop an incentive mechanism using the Stackelberg game theory that rewards MUs' contributions to the Metaverse. Through numerical experiments, we clearly show the impacts of the MUs' behaviors and how the incentive mechanism can attract more MUs and resources to the Metaverse.",2022-06-01,2022,Cong T.

W4281255712,Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews of Food Delivery Services Using Deep Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Systematic Review,"During the COVID-19 crisis, customers’ preference in having food delivered to their doorstep instead of waiting in a restaurant has propelled the growth of food delivery services (FDSs). With all restaurants going online and bringing FDSs onboard, such as UberEATS, Menulog or Deliveroo, customer reviews on online platforms have become an important source of information about the company’s performance. FDS organisations aim to gather complaints from customer feedback and effectively use the data to determine the areas for improvement to enhance customer satisfaction. This work aimed to review machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to predict customer sentiments in the FDS domain. A literature review revealed the wide usage of lexicon-based and ML techniques for predicting sentiments through customer reviews in FDS. However, limited studies applying DL techniques were found due to the lack of the model interpretability and explainability of the decisions made. The key findings of this systematic review are as follows: 77% of the models are non-interpretable in nature, and organisations can argue for the explainability and trust in the system. DL models in other domains perform well in terms of accuracy but lack explainability, which can be achieved with XAI implementation. Future research should focus on implementing DL models for sentiment analysis in the FDS domain and incorporating XAI techniques to bring out the explainability of the models.",2022-05-21,2022,Anirban Adak; Biswajeet Pradhan; Nagesh Shukla,University of Technology Sydney,Foods,98,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11101500,Advanced_Manufacturing,Interpretability; Computer science; Sentiment analysis; Artificial intelligence; Domain (mathematical analysis),0.3
W4293079011,Artificial intelligence focus and firm performance,"Abstract Artificial Intelligence is poised to transform all facets of marketing. In this study, we examine the link between firms’ focus on AI in their 10-K reports and their gross and net operating efficiency. 10-K reports are a salient source of insight into an array of issues in accounting and finance research, yet remain relatively overlooked in marketing. Drawing upon economic and marketing theory, we develop a guiding framework to show how firms’ AI focus could be related to gross and net operating efficiency. We then use a system of simultaneous equations to empirically test the relationship between AI focus and operating efficiency. Our findings confirm that US-listed firms are in a state of impending transformation with regards to AI. We show how AI focus is associated with improvements in net profitability, net operating efficiency and return on marketing-related investment while reducing adspend and creating jobs.",2022-06-08,2022,Sagarika Mishra; Michael T.

In contrast to previous research on choice overload, Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that people tend to respond positively to a large number of recommendation options (60 options), revealing diverse consumer perceptions of AI-generated recommendations. Studies 3 and 4 further illustrate the moderating effect of recommendation agents and indicate that choice overload elicits distinct patterns of consumer reactions depending on whether the recommendations are from a human or AI agent. Lastly, Study 5 directly measures consumer preferences for recommendation agents, revealing a general preference for ChatGPT, particularly when a large number of options are available.

W3204513021,Open quantum system dynamics and the mean force Gibbs state,"The dynamical convergence of a system to the thermal distribution, or Gibbs state, is a standard assumption across all of the physical sciences. The Gibbs state is determined just by temperature and the system's energies alone. But at decreasing system sizes, i.e. for nanoscale and quantum systems, the interaction with their environments is not negligible. The question then arises: Is the system's steady state still the Gibbs state? And if not, how may the steady state depend on the interaction details? Here we provide an overview of recent progress on answering these questions. We expand on the state-of-the-art along two general avenues: First we take the static point-of-view which postulates the so-called mean force Gibbs state. This view is commonly adopted in the field of strong coupling thermodynamics, where modified laws of thermodynamics and non-equilibrium fluctuation relations are established on the basis of this modified state. Second, we take the dynamical point-of-view, originating from the field of open quantum systems, which examines the time-asymptotic steady state within two paradigms. We describe the mathematical paradigm which proves return to equilibrium, i.e. convergence to the mean force Gibbs state, and then discuss a number of microscopic physical methods, particularly master equations. We conclude with a summary of established links between statics and equilibration dynamics, and provide an extensive list of open problems. This comprehensive overview will be of interest to researchers in the wider fields of quantum thermodynamics, open quantum systems, mesoscopic physics, statistical physics and quantum optics, and will find applications whenever energy is exchanged on the nanoscale, from quantum chemistry and biology, to magnetism and nanoscale heat management.",2022-03-01,2022,А.

W4213004050,Characterizing modal exponential growth behaviors of self-excited transverse and longitudinal thermoacoustic instabilities,"Self-excited thermoacoustic instabilities as frequently observed in rocket motors, gas turbines, ramjets, and aeroengine afterburners are highly detrimental and undesirable for engine manufacturers. Conventionally, modal analysis of such combustion instability is conducted by examining the eigenfrequencies. In this work, thermoacoustic dynamics coupling studies are performed as an alternative approach to predict and characterize modal growth behaviors in the presence of transverse and longitudinal combustion instabilities. Unsteady heat release is assumed to depend on the temperature rate of change that results from the chemical reaction. Coupling the unsteady heat release model with traveling waves enables the modal growth rate of acoustic disturbances to be predicted, thus providing a platform to gain insights onto stability behaviors of the combustor. Both modal growth and total energy analyses of acoustic disturbances are performed by linearizing the unsteady heat release model and recasting it into the classical time-lag N−τ formulation with respect to the velocity potential function ϕ. It is shown from both analyses that the amplitude of any acoustic disturbances tends to increase exponentially with time, until the growth rate is limited by some dissipative process ζ. The chemical reaction rate increase with temperature is shown to be unstable with respect to acoustic wave motions. Furthermore, the maximum modal “growth rate” is determined in the absence of acoustic losses, i.e., ζ = 0. The derived maximum growth rate is experimentally confirmed to be greater than those practically measured ones from both Rijke tubes and swirling combustors. A phase drift is also experimentally observed. Finally, the effects of (1) the interaction index N, (2) the time-delay τ, (3) the ratio γ of the specific heats, and (4) the acoustic losses/damping ζ are examined via cases studies. They are found to vary the critical temperature rate of change of the chemical reaction or the critical frequency ωcri above which the combustion system becomes unstable.",2022-02-01,2022,Dan Zhao; Yiheng Guan,University of Canterbury,Physics of Fluids,86,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0082617,Advanced_Manufacturing,Physics; Mechanics; Dissipative system; Thermoacoustics; Combustion,0.508
W4308338903,Consumer willingness to pay for healthier food products: A systematic review,"Summary Food retail strategies to improve the healthiness of food and beverage options may increase purchasing of healthier options and improve diets. Consumer demand for healthier options is an important determinant of the successful implementation and maintenance of healthy food retail interventions. A systematic review of peer‐reviewed literature was undertaken to explore whether consumers are willing to pay more for healthier foods and to determine the key factors that influence willingness to pay. Fifteen studies reported the results of 26 experiments providing willingness to pay estimates for healthier food products across a range of food retail environments. Twenty three out of the 26 experiments included in this review (88.5%) found consumers would pay a 5.6% to 91.5% (mean 30.7%) price premium for healthier foods. Studies consistently found a positive willingness to pay for foods with reduced fat and wholegrains with additional fruit and vegetables, while willingness to pay for foods with reduced salt or a combination of low fat and sugar, or salt showed mixed results. Adults over 60 years, females, those living with obesity, and consumers who aim to maintain a healthy lifestyle were more likely to pay a price premium for healthier food, whereas younger consumers, consumers with healthy weight, and consumers with higher levels of education were less likely to pay higher prices. The results of this review contribute to our understanding of consumer preferences for healthier products and provide information to retailers on consumer surplus (benefits) associated with the provision of healthier food alternatives.",2022-11-07,2022,Moosa Alsubhi; Miranda R.

W4386946669,"AI-Empowered Methods for Smart Energy Consumption: A Review of Load Forecasting, Anomaly Detection and Demand Response","Abstract This comprehensive review paper aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the most recent developments in the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, with an emphasis on their critical role in the demand side of power distribution systems. This paper offers a meticulous examination of various AI models and a pragmatic guide to aid in selecting the suitable techniques for three areas: load forecasting, anomaly detection, and demand response in real-world applications. In the realm of load forecasting, the paper presents a thorough guide for choosing the most fitting machine learning and deep learning models, inclusive of reinforcement learning, in conjunction with the application of hybrid models and learning optimization strategies. This selection process is informed by the properties of load data and the specific scenarios that necessitate forecasting. Concerning anomaly detection, this paper provides an overview of the merits and limitations of disparate learning methods, fostering a discussion on the optimization strategies that can be harnessed to navigate the issue of imbalanced data, a prevalent concern in power system anomaly detection. As for demand response, we delve into the utilization of AI techniques, examining both incentive-based and price-based demand response schemes. We take into account various control targets, input sources, and applications that pertain to their use and effectiveness. In conclusion, this review paper is structured to offer useful insights into the selection and design of AI techniques focusing on the demand-side applications of future energy systems.

W4385316099,The Effect of Macroeconomic Uncertainty on Firm Decisions,"Using a new survey of firms in New Zealand, we document how exogenous variation in the macroeconomic uncertainty perceived by firms affects their economic decisions. We use randomized information treatments that provide different types of information about the first and/or second moments of future economic growth to generate exogenous changes in the perceived macroeconomic uncertainty of some firms. The effects on their decisions relative to their initial plans as well as relative to an untreated control group are measured in a follow‐up survey six months later. We find that as firms become more uncertain, they reduce their prices, employment, and investment, their sales decline, and they become less likely to invest in new technologies or open new facilities. These ex post effects of uncertainty are similar to how firms say they would respond to higher uncertainty when asked hypothetical questions.",2023-01-01,2023,Saten Kumar; Yuriy Gorodnichenko; Olivier Coibion,Auckland University of Technology,Econometrica,73,https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta21004,Advanced_Manufacturing,Economics; Investment (military); Control (management); Investment decisions; Survey data collection,0.225
W4382356161,Simulations of common-envelope evolution in binary stellar systems: physical models and numerical techniques,"Abstract When the primary star in a close binary system evolves into a giant and engulfs its companion, its core and the companion temporarily orbit each other inside a common envelope. Drag forces transfer orbital energy and angular momentum to the envelope material. Depending on the efficiency of this process, the envelope may be ejected leaving behind a tight remnant binary system of two stellar cores, or the cores merge retaining part of the envelope material. The exact outcome of common-envelope evolution is critical for in the formation of X-ray binaries, supernova progenitors, the progenitors of compact-object mergers that emit detectable gravitational waves, and many other objects of fundamental astrophysical relevance. The wide ranges of spatial and temporal timescales that characterize common-envelope interactions and the lack of spatial symmetries present a substantial challenge to generating consistent models. Therefore, these critical phases are one of the largest sources for uncertainty in classical treatments of binary stellar evolution. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of at least part of the common-envelope interaction are the key to gain predictive power in modeling common-envelope evolution. We review the development of theoretical concepts and numerical approaches for such three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. The inherent multi-physics, multi-scale challenges have resulted in a wide variety of approximations and numerical techniques to be exercised on the problem. We summarize the simulations published to date and their main results. Given the recent rapid progress, a sound understanding of the physics of common-envelope interactions is within reach and thus there is hope that one of the remaining fundamental problems of stellar astrophysics may be solved before long.",2023-05-04,2023,F.

W4366245640,Overcoming barriers to implement digital technologies to achieve sustainable production and consumption in the food sector: A circular economy perspective,"Food security and waste minimisation are the main concerns for the management of food supply chains (FSC), as >33 % of global food production is wasted or lost due to mismanagement. Stakeholders must address the ongoing issues, such as resource scarcity, climate change, waste creation etc. to create an environment conducive to sustainable production and consumption (SPC) and to promote economic sustainability. Resource efficiency and waste minimization are necessary for SPC in the FSC. Technologies from the Industry 4.0 era have demonstrated their ability to address these problems effectively. However, there are barriers to the adoption of digital technology because of internal or external issues. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the challenges faced by the food industry while applying digital technology to attain SPC. The current study has adopted an integrated methodology of Best-Worst-Method (BWM)-Level Based Weight Assessment (LBWA) and Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) methods to analyse the barriers in implementing digital technologies to achieve SPC in FSC. Strategic measures to overcome these barriers are suggested. The BWM-LBWA-CoCoSo technique is used for the first time in this study to evaluate the barriers and determine the most effective strategies. According to the BWM-LBWA research, “organisational barriers” are the main impediment to the adoption of digital technology for SPC in the FSC. According to CoCoSo findings, the best way to overcome the major barriers is to “focus on improving commitment from senior management towards SPC.” The study gives decision-makers information about the major barriers in utilizing advanced digital technology to achieve SPC in FSC.",2023-04-19,2023,Manu Sharma; Sudhanshu Joshi; Kannan Govindan,University of Technology Sydney,Sustainable Production and Consumption,69,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2023.04.002,Advanced_Manufacturing,Circular economy; Production (economics); Perspective (graphical); Consumption (sociology); Sustainable consumption,0.508
W4385423617,Moving beyond “the” business case: How to make corporate sustainability work,"Abstract One of the most investigated research topics in the corporate sustainability literature is “the” business case. Long lionized for linking the profit motive to corporate environmental initiatives, the business case for sustainability is now vehemently criticized. These critics generally argue for a return to the state and stronger regulatory frameworks. Others counter that because the private sector's capabilities are uniquely suited to realizing effective sustainability innovations and outcomes, we must not abandon but further develop our business case understanding. In this view, firms' voluntary efforts are key for innovative solutions to sustainability problems. This article overviews and unites these seemingly disparate positions. We move the field forward by placing in context criticisms and also opportunities for more meaningful positive impacts from corporate sustainability. Specifically, we argue that an effective business case orientation requires shifting to a broader “all stakeholders win” approach. This entails impact orientation, collaborative approaches, and economic restraint.",2023-07-31,2023,Timo Busch; Michael L. Barnett; Roger Burritt; Benjamin Cashore; R.

W4393199986,Ecological countermeasures to prevent pathogen spillover and subsequent pandemics,"Abstract Substantial global attention is focused on how to reduce the risk of future pandemics. Reducing this risk requires investment in prevention, preparedness, and response. Although preparedness and response have received significant focus, prevention, especially the prevention of zoonotic spillover, remains largely absent from global conversations. This oversight is due in part to the lack of a clear definition of prevention and lack of guidance on how to achieve it. To address this gap, we elucidate the mechanisms linking environmental change and zoonotic spillover using spillover of viruses from bats as a case study. We identify ecological interventions that can disrupt these spillover mechanisms and propose policy frameworks for their implementation. Recognizing that pandemics originate in ecological systems, we advocate for integrating ecological approaches alongside biomedical approaches in a comprehensive and balanced pandemic prevention strategy.",2024-03-26,2024,Raina K.

W4321609613,"Interventions to Reduce Risk for Pathogen Spillover and Early Disease Spread to Prevent Outbreaks, Epidemics, and Pandemics","The pathogens that cause most emerging infectious diseases in humans originate in animals, particularly wildlife, and then spill over into humans. The accelerating frequency with which humans and domestic animals encounter wildlife because of activities such as land-use change, animal husbandry, and markets and trade in live wildlife has created growing opportunities for pathogen spillover. The risk of pathogen spillover and early disease spread among domestic animals and humans, however, can be reduced by stopping the clearing and degradation of tropical and subtropical forests, improving health and economic security of communities living in emerging infectious disease hotspots, enhancing biosecurity in animal husbandry, shutting down or strictly regulating wildlife markets and trade, and expanding pathogen surveillance. We summarize expert opinions on how to implement these goals to prevent outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.",2023-02-23,2023,Neil M. Vora; Lee Hannah; Chris Walzer; Mariana M.

W4377042545,The Validity of Hawkin Dynamics Wireless Dual Force Plates for Measuring Countermovement Jump and Drop Jump Variables,"Force plate testing is becoming more commonplace in sport due to the advent of commercially available, portable, and affordable force plate systems (i.e., hardware and software). Following the validation of the Hawkin Dynamics Inc. (HD) proprietary software in recent literature, the aim of this study was to determine the concurrent validity of the HD wireless dual force plate hardware for assessing vertical jumps. During a single testing session, the HD force plates were placed directly atop two adjacent Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc. in-ground force plates (the “gold standard”) to simultaneously collect vertical ground reaction forces produced by 20 participants (27 ± 6 years, 85 ± 14 kg, 176.5 ± 9.23 cm) during the countermovement jump (CMJ) and drop jump (DJ) tests (1000 Hz). Agreement between force plate systems was determined via ordinary least products regression using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. No bias was present between the two force plate systems for any of the CMJ and DJ variables, except DJ peak braking force (proportional bias) and DJ peak braking power (fixed and proportional bias). The HD system may be considered a valid alternative to the industry gold standard for assessing vertical jumps because fixed or proportional bias was identified for none of the CMJ variables (n = 17) and only 2 out of 18 DJ variables.",2023-05-17,2023,Andrew J.

W3001091189,Progressive Local Filter Pruning for Image Retrieval Acceleration,"This paper focuses on network pruning for image retrieval acceleration. Prevailing image retrieval works target at the discriminative feature learning, while little attention is paid to how to accelerate the model inference, which should be taken into consideration in real-world practice. The challenge of pruning image retrieval models is that the middle-level feature should be preserved as much as possible. Such different requirements of the retrieval and classification model make the traditional pruning methods not that suitable for our task. To solve the problem, we propose a new Progressive Local Filter Pruning (PLFP) method for image retrieval acceleration. Specifically, layer by layer, we analyze the local geometric properties of each filter and select the one that can be replaced by the neighbors. Then we progressively prune the filter by gradually changing the filter weights. In this way, the representation ability of the model is preserved. To verify this, we evaluate our method on two widely-used image retrieval datasets,i.e., Oxford5k and Paris6K, and one person re-identification dataset,i.e., Market-1501. The proposed method arrives with superior performance to the conventional pruning methods, suggesting the effectiveness of the proposed method for image retrieval.",2023-01-01,2023,Xiaodong Wang; Zhedong Zheng; Yang He; Fei Yan; Zhiqiang Zeng,University of Technology Sydney,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,53,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmm.2023.3256092,Advanced_Manufacturing,Computer science; Pruning; Discriminative model; Image retrieval; Artificial intelligence,0.208
W4361214613,"A comparison of machine learning models’ accuracy in predicting lower-limb joints’ kinematics, kinetics, and muscle forces from wearable sensors","Abstract A combination of wearable sensors’ data and Machine Learning (ML) techniques has been used in many studies to predict specific joint angles and moments. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of four different non-linear regression ML models to estimate lower-limb joints’ kinematics, kinetics, and muscle forces using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and electromyographys’ (EMGs) data. Seventeen healthy volunteers (9F, 28 ± 5 years) were asked to walk over-ground for a minimum of 16 trials. For each trial, marker trajectories and three force-plates data were recorded to calculate pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle kinematics and kinetics, and muscle forces (the targets), as well as 7 IMUs and 16 EMGs. The features from sensors’ data were extracted using the Tsfresh python package and fed into 4 ML models; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline for targets’ prediction. The RF and CNN models outperformed the other ML models by providing lower prediction errors in all intended targets with a lower computational cost. This study suggested that a combination of wearable sensors’ data with an RF or a CNN model is a promising tool to overcome the limitations of traditional optical motion capture for 3D gait analysis.",2023-03-28,2023,Shima Mohammadi Moghadam; Ted Yeung; Julie Choisne,University of Auckland,Scientific Reports,53,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31906-z,Advanced_Manufacturing,Kinematics; Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Random forest; Inertial measurement unit,0.358
W4390728260,Using blockchain or not? A focal firm's blockchain strategy in the context of carbon emission reduction technology innovation,"Abstract Recently, blockchain has been increasingly applied to low‐carbon supply chains, enabling consumers to track production process of low‐carbon products, thereby improving brand awareness and expanding the market. However, do the operation and construction costs of blockchain come at the expense of squeezing resources originally allocated for research and development (R&amp;D) of carbon emission reduction (CER) or reducing firms profits? Given the varying capacities of different types of firms to bear the costs of blockchain in the process of R&amp;D of CER, this paper considers two categories of firms, superior brand firms and inferior brand firms, and studies the impact of blockchain usage on CER and profits. Research shows that the usage of blockchain is not necessarily beneficial to CER and profits enhancement. Consumers' trust and low‐carbon preference, brand awareness, blockchain operation and construction costs, and R&amp;D difficulty of CER are key factors. Superior brand firms can improve CER level and profits through blockchain when R&amp;D difficulty is low and consumers' trust is high or when R&amp;D difficulty is high but consumers' low‐carbon preferences and brand awareness are high. Inferior brand firms can improve CER level and profits through blockchain when R&amp;D difficulty is low and consumers' trust is high or when R&amp;D difficulty is high but brand awareness is low. This study provides strategic insights for brand firms considering the usage of blockchain in their CER initiatives, highlighting the importance of aligning blockchain integration with firm‐specific characteristics and market conditions to achieve both environmental and profit objectives.",2024-01-08,2024,Jianhua Zhu; Taiwen Feng; Ying Lu; Wenbo Jiang,Macquarie University,Business Strategy and the Environment,52,https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.3664,Advanced_Manufacturing,Blockchain; Context (archaeology); Business; Preference; Industrial organization,0.433
W4391293684,Modelling the role of industrial structure adjustment on China's energy efficiency: Insights from technology innovation,"Due to uncoordinated economic progress, China's regional gap concerning energy efficiency (EE) is noticeable. However, industrial structure adjustments can be reorganized as a promising way to prioritize the green and low-carbon transition. Aiming to understand how regional EE can be achieved through industrial structure adjustment, this study empirically investigates the role of industrial structure adjustment in increasing interprovincial EE from a technology innovation perspective. Unlike previous studies, the primary analytical framework is anchored on the spatio-temporal domain. Specifically, we observe that industrial structure rationalization and industrial structure adjustment not only directly influence local EE but also indirectly exert a positive effect on EE improvements in adjacent provinces. Further mechanism analysis shows that technology innovation positively moderates industrial structure adjustment to EE enhancements, with regional heterogeneity being all-important. We find that the non-linear effect of industrial structure adjustment on EE is conditioned by technology innovation. Increasing R&D input intensity could significantly change the impacts of industrial structure adjustments on EE efficiency.",2024-01-01,2024,Miaomiao Tao; Stephen Poletti; Le Wen; Mingyue Selena Sheng,University of Auckland,Journal of Cleaner Production,45,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.140861,Advanced_Manufacturing,Rationalization (economics); China; Industrial organization; Economics; Economic geography,0.45
W4392865184,Artificial intelligence and multimodal data fusion for smart healthcare: topic modeling and bibliometrics,"Abstract Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have driven extensive research into developing diverse multimodal data analysis approaches for smart healthcare. There is a scarcity of large-scale analysis of literature in this field based on quantitative approaches. This study performed a bibliometric and topic modeling examination on 683 articles from 2002 to 2022, focusing on research topics and trends, journals, countries/regions, institutions, authors, and scientific collaborations. Results showed that, firstly, the number of articles has grown from 1 in 2002 to 220 in 2022, with a majority being published in interdisciplinary journals that link healthcare and medical research and information technology and AI. Secondly, the significant rise in the quantity of research articles can be attributed to the increasing contribution of scholars from non-English speaking countries/regions and the noteworthy contributions made by authors in the USA and India. Thirdly, researchers show a high interest in diverse research issues, especially, cross-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for brain tumor analysis, cancer prognosis through multi-dimensional data analysis, and AI-assisted diagnostics and personalization in healthcare, with each topic experiencing a significant increase in research interest. There is an emerging trend towards issues such as applying generative adversarial networks and contrastive learning for multimodal medical image fusion and synthesis and utilizing the combined spatiotemporal resolution of functional MRI and electroencephalogram in a data-centric manner.

W4392966853,A meta-analytic integration of the theory of planned behavior and the value-belief-norm model to predict green consumption,"Purpose This study aims to integrate the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the value-belief-norm (VBN) theory into a meta-analytic framework to synthesize green consumption literature. Design/methodology/approach By integrating the findings from 173 studies, a meta-analysis was performed adopting several analytical methods: bivariate analysis, moderation analysis and path analysis. Findings VBN- and TPB-based psychological factors (adverse consequences, ascribed responsibility, personal norms, subjective norms, attitude and perceived behavioral control) mediate the effects of altruistic, biospheric and egoistic values on green purchase intention. Further, inconsistencies in the proposed relationships are due to cultural factors (i.e. individualism-collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity–femininity, short- vs long-term orientation and indulgence-restraint) and countries’ human development status. Research limitations/implications The authors selected papers published in English; hence, other relevant papers in this domain published in other languages might have been missed. Practical implications The findings are useful to marketers of green offerings in designing strategies, i.e. specific messages, targeting different customers based on countries’ cultural score and human development index, to harvest positive customer responses.

W4398796607,Desirable Characteristics for AI Teaching Assistants in Programming Education,"Providing timely and personalized feedback to large numbers of students is a long-standing challenge in programming courses.Relying on human teaching assistants (TAs) has been extensively studied, revealing a number of potential shortcomings.These include inequitable access for students with low confidence when needing support, as well as situations where TAs provide direct solutions without helping students to develop their own problemsolving skills.With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), digital teaching assistants configured for programming contexts have emerged as an appealing and scalable way to provide instant, equitable, round-the-clock support.Although digital TAs can provide a variety of help for programming tasks, from high-level problem solving advice to direct solution generation, the effectiveness of such tools depends on their ability to promote meaningful learning experiences.If students find the guardrails implemented in digital TAs too constraining, or if other expectations are not met, they may seek assistance in ways that do not help them learn.Thus, it is essential to identify the features that students believe make digital teaching assistants valuable.We deployed an LLM-powered digital assistant in an introductory programming course and collected student feedback ( = 813) on the characteristics of the tool they perceived to be most important.Our results highlight that students value such tools for their ability to provide instant, engaging support, particularly during peak times such as before assessment deadlines.They also expressed a strong preference for features that enable them to retain autonomy in their learning journey, such as scaffolding that helps to guide them through problem-solving steps rather than simply being shown direct solutions.",2024-07-03,2024,Paul Denny; Stephen MacNeil; Jaromír Šavelka; Leo Porter; Andrew Luxton-Reilly,University of Auckland,,39,https://doi.org/10.1145/3649217.3653574,Advanced_Manufacturing,Computer science; Autonomy; Scalability; Preference; Variety (cybernetics),0.433
W4390685244,Make every dollar count: The impact of green credit regulation on corporate green investment efficiency,"This paper systematically examines the impact of green credit regulation on the efficiency of corporate green investment. The results show that green credit policy significantly decreases green investment efficiency for heavily polluting firms. This is further evidenced through the fact that these firms are more inclined to make symbolic efforts to pursue more credit resources rather than engaging in substantive green investments to drive real green transition. This negative effect is more pronounced for small, non-state-owned and non-foreign-funded firms. Our further analysis suggests that the intensity of environmental law enforcement, the level of financial development, and intellectual property protection can mitigate this negative effect of green credit policy on green investment efficiency. Our study is groundbreaking in that it makes the first attempt to calculate the future value that green investment can create, which serves the basis for analyzing the economic effects of green investment at the industry level. The findings indicate that labor-intensive industries with close ties to consumers' daily lives have a higher future value for green investment. Conversely, capital-intensive industries such as the metallurgical industry have a lower future value for green investment. These findings emphasize the need to improve green credit regulation and make genuine green investment to accelerate real green transition in emerging economies.",2024-01-09,2024,Jinfang Tian; Siyang Sun; Wei Cao; Di Bu; Rui Xue,Macquarie University,Energy Economics,38,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107307,Advanced_Manufacturing,Investment (military); Green economy; Liberian dollar; Return on investment; Value (mathematics),0.375

As its deployment increasingly depends on data from multiple entities, ensuring privacy for these contributors becomes paramount for the integrity and fairness of machine learning endeavors. This review looks into the recent advancements in secure multi-party computation (SMPC) for machine learning, a pivotal technology championing data privacy. We evaluate these applications from various aspects, including security models, requirements, system types, and service models, aligning with the IEEE's recommended practices for SMPC. Broadly, SMPC systems are divided into two categories: homomorphic-based systems, which facilitate computations on encrypted data, ensuring data remains confidential, and secret sharing-based systems, which disseminate data across parties in fragmented shares. Our literature analysis highlights certain gaps, such as security requisites, streamlined information exchange, incentive structures, data authenticity, and operational efficiency. Recognizing these challenges lead to envisioning a holistic SMPC protocol tailored for machine learning applications.",2024-01-01,2024,Ian Zhou; Farzad Tofigh; Massimo Piccardi; Mehran Abolhasan; Daniel Franklin,University of Technology Sydney,IEEE Access,33,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2024.3388992,Advanced_Manufacturing,Computer science; Confidentiality; Encryption; Dissemination; Computer security,0.45

However, there is a gap in the literature regarding the effectiveness of environmental policies in promoting renewable energy innovations. To bridge this gap, we have adopted a systematic literature review process covering the period from 2005 to 2023. We identified and analysed 29 articles in our final sample. Further, we employ two levels of analysis (individual‐policy and policy‐mix levels) for analysing the extant research. Our findings show that fiscal incentives and emissions trading policies such as the European Union (EU) Emissions Trading System (ETS) consistently promote renewable energy innovations. In contrast, the effectiveness of feed‐in tariffs and quotas in supporting renewable energy innovations varies, reflecting diverse impacts across distinct regions and renewable energy technologies. Our analysis also suggests that combinations of various policy types can enhance innovation more effectively than individual policies. We contribute to the extant literature by developing a classificatory analysis of the effect of environmental policies on renewable energy innovations.

Thirty-three elite female soccer players (age: 18.7 ± 3.7 years; height: 158.3 ± 5.9 cm; body mass: 62.8 ± 5.5 kg) performed three unilateral trials on a single occasion of the 90–90° isometric hamstring assessment. Force-time data were collected using force plates at 1000 Hz and down sampled to 500-, 250-, and 100 Hz. Peak force (N), force (N) at 100- and 200 ms and average rate of force development (aRFD) (N/s) over a 100- and 200 ms epoch were calculated. A repeated measures of analysis of variance and effect size was used to compare means. Excellent absolute and good relative reliability was observed for peak force across all sampling frequencies. Force at 100- and 200 ms and aRFD over 100 ms and 200 ms resulted poor-moderate relative reliability and poor-excellent absolute reliability. No significant trivial differences were observed for peak force between sampling frequencies ( P &gt; 0.05, Cohen’s d = 0.02–0.12). A significant difference ( P &lt; 0.001) was identified in 500, 250 and 100 Hz, with small-moderate and small-large increases in force at set time points and aRFD, respectively, in comparison to 1000 Hz ( d = 0.21–2.00). Higher sampling frequencies (&gt; 500 Hz) reduces the reliability of time dependent force characteristics, with minimal effect on peak force. Regular monitoring of peak force can be performed with higher sampling frequencies, but lower sampling frequencies would be beneficial to collect reliable rapid-force generating measures.",2024-04-12,2024,Nicholas J.

Healthcare professionals could be viable conduits for PA promotion. However, the evidence regarding the effectiveness and benefits of the current forms of PA promotion are inconclusive. Healthcare professionals’ perceptions on key determinants impact on the optimum promotion of PA were explored in this review. Thirty-four (34) studies were identified after systematically searching seven databases for peer-reviewed articles published within the last decade. PA advice or counselling was the most recorded form of PA promotion, limited counselling time was the most reported obstacle while providing incentives was viewed as a key facilitator. There is widespread consensus among healthcare professionals (HCPs) on some aspects of PA promotion. Utilisation of all PA promotional pathways to their full potential could be an essential turning point towards the optimal success of PA promotional goals. Hence, strategies are required to broaden chronic disease treatment methods to include preventive and integrative PA promotion approaches particularly, between frontline HCPs (e.g., GPs) and PA specialists (e.g., EPs).

W3038100608,"Sport Biomechanics Applications Using Inertial, Force, and EMG Sensors: A Literature Overview","In the last few decades, a number of technological developments have advanced the spread of wearable sensors for the assessment of human motion. These sensors have been also developed to assess athletes’ performance, providing useful guidelines for coaching, as well as for injury prevention. The data from these sensors provides key performance outcomes as well as more detailed kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic data that provides insight into how the performance was obtained. From this perspective, inertial sensors, force sensors, and electromyography appear to be the most appropriate wearable sensors to use. Several studies were conducted to verify the feasibility of using wearable sensors for sport applications by using both commercially available and customized sensors. The present study seeks to provide an overview of sport biomechanics applications found from recent literature using wearable sensors, highlighting some information related to the used sensors and analysis methods. From the literature review results, it appears that inertial sensors are the most widespread sensors for assessing athletes’ performance; however, there still exist applications for force sensors and electromyography in this context.

We outline China's 2030 projected domestic seafood production and consumption through an examination of available statistics, and qualitatively evaluate these in relation to key stated Chinese policy targets, consumer trends, and dominant political narratives. Our analysis shows that by 2030 China is likely to see seafood consumption outstrip domestic production. To meet the seafood gap China will likely attempt to increase domestic freshwater and offshore aquaculture, increase seafood imports, possibly expand the distant water fishing industry, and invest in seafood production abroad.

The proposed stability control algorithm is composed of the following three remarkable characteristics: 1) As the vehicle sideslip angle which is very useful in vehicle stability control is often unavailable or unmeasurable for practical applications, a sliding mode-based state observer is proposed to online estimate the actual sideslip angle via the yaw rate and the lateral acceleration measurements. 2) ASM lateral stability controller, as an upper level controller, is designed to calculate the corrected steering angle for driving both the yaw rate and the sideslip angle to achieve their desired values in the presence of modelling uncertainties and external disturbances. Moreover, an adaptive law is incorporated in the control law to estimate the switching gain such that the complex uncertainty bound information can be avoided. 3) The desired steering angle is realized by a lower steering controller via ASM for an SBW system. The hardware-in-the-loop simulation results demonstrate the excellent stability control performance of the proposed control for different steering maneuvers.",2020-06-18,2020,Jie Zhang; Hai Wang; Jinchuan Zheng; Zhenwei Cao; Zhihong Man,Murdoch University,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,116,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2020.3003326,Advanced_Manufacturing,Yaw; Control theory (sociology); Electronic stability control; Controller (irrigation); Engineering,0.3
W3126956508,A Game-Theoretical Approach for Mitigating Edge DDoS Attack,"Edge computing (EC) is an emerging paradigm that extends cloud computing by pushing computing resources onto edge servers that are attached to base stations or access points at the edge of the cloud in close proximity with end-users. Due to edge servers' geographic distribution, the EC paradigm is challenged by many new security threats, including the notorious distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. In the EC environment, edge servers usually have constrained processing capacities due to their limited sizes. Thus, they are particularly vulnerable to DDoS attacks. DDoS attacks in the EC environment render existing DDoS mitigation approaches obsolete with its new characteristics. In this article, we make the first attempt to tackle the edge DDoS mitigation (EDM) problem. We model it as a constraint optimization problem and prove its <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathcal {NP}$</tex-math></inline-formula> -hardness. To solve this problem, we propose an optimal approach named EDMOpti and a novel game-theoretical approach named EDMGame for mitigating edge DDoS attacks. EDMGame formulates the EDM problem as a potential EDM Game that admits a Nash equilibrium and employs a decentralized algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium as the solution to the EDM problem. Through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our approaches can solve the EDM problem effectively and efficiently.",2021-01-29,2021,Qiang He; Cheng Wang; Guangming Cui; Bo Li; Rui Zhou,Swinburne University of Technology,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,112,https://doi.org/10.1109/tdsc.2021.3055559,Advanced_Manufacturing,Computer science; Denial-of-service attack; Application layer DDoS attack; Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution; Game theory,0.225
W3127275112,Adaptive Resilient Event-Triggered Control Design of Autonomous Vehicles With an Iterative Single Critic Learning Framework,"This article investigates the adaptive resilient event-triggered control for rear-wheel-drive autonomous (RWDA) vehicles based on an iterative single critic learning framework, which can effectively balance the frequency/changes in adjusting the vehicle’s control during the running process. According to the kinematic equation of RWDA vehicles and the desired trajectory, the tracking error system during the autonomous driving process is first built, where the denial-of-service (DoS) attacking signals are injected into the networked communication and transmission. Combining the event-triggered sampling mechanism and iterative single critic learning framework, a new event-triggered condition is developed for the adaptive resilient control algorithm, and the novel utility function design is considered for driving the autonomous vehicle, where the control input can be guaranteed into an applicable saturated bound. Finally, we apply the new adaptive resilient control scheme to a case of driving the RWDA vehicles, and the simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and practicality successfully.",2021-02-03,2021,Kun Zhang; Rong Su; Huaguang Zhang; Yunlin Tian,University of Wollongong,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,110,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2021.3053269,Advanced_Manufacturing,Iterative learning control; Computer science; Trajectory; Adaptive control; Kinematics,0.375
W3083914698,Latest Research Trends in Gait Analysis Using Wearable Sensors and Machine Learning: A Systematic Review,"Gait is the locomotion attained through the movement of limbs and gait analysis examines the patterns (normal/abnormal) depending on the gait cycle. It contributes to the development of various applications in the medical, security, sports, and fitness domains to improve the overall outcome. Among many available technologies, two emerging technologies that play a central role in modern day gait analysis are: A) wearable sensors which provide a convenient, efficient, and inexpensive way to collect data and B) Machine Learning Methods (MLMs) which enable high accuracy gait feature extraction for analysis. Given their prominent roles, this paper presents a review of the latest trends in gait analysis using wearable sensors and Machine Learning (ML). It explores the recent papers along with the publication details and key parameters such as sampling rates, MLMs, wearable sensors, number of sensors, and their locations. Furthermore, the paper provides recommendations for selecting a MLM, wearable sensor and its location for a specific application.

W3007864963,Prospects for sustainability of pig production in relation to climate change and novel feed resources,"Pig production systems provide multiple benefits to humans. However, the global increase in meat consumption has profound consequences for our earth. This perspective describes two alternative scenarios for improving the sustainability of future pig production systems. The first scenario is a high input-high output system based on sustainable intensification, maximizing animal protein production efficiency on a limited land surface at the same time as minimizing environmental impacts. The second scenario is a reduced input-reduced output system based on selecting animals that are more robust to climate change and are better adapted to transform low quality feed (local feeds, feedstuff co-products, food waste) into meat. However, in contrast to the first scenario, the latter scenario results in reduced predicted yields, reduced production efficiency and possibly increased costs to the consumer. National evaluation of the availability of local feed and feedstuff co-product alternatives, determination of limits to feed sourced from international markets, available land for crop and livestock production, desired production levels, and a willingness to politically enforce policies through subsidies and/or penalties are some of the considerations to combine these two scenarios. Given future novel sustainable alternatives to livestock animal protein, it may become reasonable to move towards an added general premium price on 'protein from livestock animals' to the benefit of promoting higher incomes to farmers at the same time as covering the extra costs of, politically enforced, welfare of livestock animals in sustainable production systems. © 2020 The Authors.

W3095938453,Mitigating inequality with emissions? Exploring energy justice and financing transitions to low carbon energy in Indonesia,"Many countries around the globe demonstrate a growing commitment to achieve universal electrification in alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 7. Indonesia is among the countries that have made a concerted effort to alleviate energy poverty, mindful that around 25 million of its citizens live without access to electricity. This article examines Indonesia's efforts to realize its vision of energy justice by mobilizing private finance for renewable rural electrification. In particular, it investigates to what extent and in what ways Indonesia has addressed energy justice issues and their social implications. Interviews and document analysis reveal that Indonesia's energy justice vision has manifested in policies and initiatives that focus narrowly on distributive energy justice in terms of energy accessibility and affordability. However, procedural and recognition aspects of energy justice remain unaddressed. Such a myopic interpretation of energy justice has resulted in policies that prioritize large scale and on-grid solutions and substantially reduce financial options for small and distributed renewable energy initiatives. It also perpetuates spatial inequality and reinforces the exclusion and disempowerment of energy poor communities from energy decisions. The findings suggest that for a broader energy justice vision to be realized, it will be necessary to design and implement energy policies that holistically address all elements of energy justice and facilitate the use of diverse forms of finance to address energy poverty.",2020-10-30,2020,Abidah Setyowati,Australian National University,Energy Research & Social Science,107,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101817,Advanced_Manufacturing,Inequality; Greenhouse gas; Energy (signal processing); Carbon fibers; Natural resource economics,0.375
W3114687565,A New Method for Peer Matching and Negotiation of Prosumers in Peer-to-Peer Energy Markets,"This article presents a scalable mechanism for peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among prosumers in a smart grid. In the proposed mechanism, prosumers engage in a non-mediated negotiation with their peers to reach an agreement on the price and quantity of energy to be exchanged. Instead of concurrent bilateral negotiation between all peers with high overheads, an iterative peer matching process is employed to match peers for bilateral negotiation. The proposed negotiation algorithm enables prosumers to come to an agreement, given that they have no prior knowledge about the preference structure of their trading partners. A greediness factor is introduced to model the selfish behavior of prosumers in the negotiation process and to investigate its impact on the negotiation outcome. In order to recover the costs related to power losses, a transaction fee is applied to each transaction that enables the grid operator to recover incurred losses due to P2P trades. The case studies demonstrate that the proposed mechanism discourages greedy behavior of prosumers in the negotiation process as it does not increase their economic surplus. Also, it has an appropriate performance from the computation overheads and scalability perspectives.",2020-12-31,2020,Mohsen Khorasany; Amrit Paudel; Reza Razzaghi; Pierluigi Siano,Monash University,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,107,https://doi.org/10.1109/tsg.2020.3048397,Advanced_Manufacturing,Scalability; Negotiation; Computer science; Peer-to-peer; Matching (statistics),0.225

Specifically, herein we shall consider black-bounce-Reissner-Nordstr\""om and black-bounce-Kerr-Newman spacetimes as particularly simple and clean everywhere-regular black hole ""mimickers"" that deviate from the Kerr-Newman family in a precisely controlled and minimal manner, and smoothly interpolate between regular black holes and traversable wormholes. While observationally the electric charges on astrophysical black holes are likely to be extremely low, $|Q|/m \ll 1$, introducing any non-zero electric charge has a significant theoretical impact. In particular, we verify the existence of a Killing tensor (and associated Carter-like constant) but without the full Killing tower of principal tensor and Killing-Yano tensor, also we discuss how, assuming general relativity, the black-bounce-Kerr-Newman solution requires an interesting, non-trivial matter/energy content.",2021-07-01,2021,Edgardo Franzin; Stefano Liberati; Jacopo Mazza; Alex Simpson; Matt Visser,Victoria University of Wellington,Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics,107,https://doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2021/07/036,Advanced_Manufacturing,Physics; Black hole (networking); General relativity; Rotating black hole; Tensor (intrinsic definition),0.3
W3101431425,Strategies to Manage the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Supply Chain: Implications for Improving Economic and Social Sustainability,"This paper aims to identify the negative impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on supply chains and propose strategies to deal with the impacts in the context of the readymade garment (RMG) industry supply chain of an emerging economy: Bangladesh. To achieve the aims, a methodological framework is proposed through a literature review, expert inputs, and a decision-aid tool, namely the grey-based digraph-matrix method. A total of 10 types of negative impacts and 22 strategic measures to tackle the impacts were identified based on the literature review and expert inputs. Then, the grey-based digraph-matrix was applied for modeling the strategic measures based on their influence to deal with the impacts. Findings reveal that the strategies “manufacturing flexibility”, “diversify the source of supply”, and “develop backup suppliers” have significant positive consequences for managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the RMG supply chain. The findings help industrial managers recover from supply chain disruptions by identifying and classifying the impacts and strategies required to manage the major supply chain disturbances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a theoretical contribution, this study is one of few initial attempts to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak and the strategies to deal with the impacts in the supply chain context.",2020-11-14,2020,Hasin Md.

W3192746032,"Net‐zero emission targets and the role of managerial environmental awareness, customer pressure, and regulatory control toward environmental performance","Abstract To avoid the worst effects of global warming, countries agreed to limit warming below 2.0°C and ideally to 1.5°C preindustrial level. This requires countries to drop half of their greenhouse gas emission by 2030 and reach net‐zero emission by 2050. In this regard, current study explores the role of green production as a mediator in the impact of managerial environmental awareness, customer pressure, and regulatory control on environmental performance. The data collected from 381 managers was analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. Results indicate that customer pressure, regulatory control, and managerial environmental awareness play a pivotal role toward green production, whereas only managerial environmental awareness among them directly influences environmental performance. Green production fully mediates the relationship from customer pressure and regulatory control to environmental performance. However, it partially mediates the relation between managerial environmental awareness and environmental performance. Similarly, the importance of green production for environmental performance is highlighted.",2021-08-02,2021,Hashim Zameer; Ying Wang; Rashid Saeed,University of South Australia,Business Strategy and the Environment,96,https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.2866,Advanced_Manufacturing,Greenhouse gas; Production (economics); Control (management); Business; Global warming,0.283
W3028944474,"Benefits, barriers, and incentives for improved resilience to disruption in university teaching","Pandemics, earthquakes, fire, war, and other disasters place universities at risk. Disasters can disrupt learning and teaching (L&T) for weeks to months or longer. Some institutions have developed business continuity plans to protect key organisational services and structures, allowing L&T to continue. However, little research touches on how academics, learners, and communities of practice might respond before, during, and after disasters and how their resilience to disruption can be fostered to reduce impacts on L&T. In this research, we investigated academics’ perceptions of building resilience to major L&T disruptions in the New Zealand context. Specifically, we explored how academics characterise a resilient academic and institution, and identified the benefits, barriers, and incentives to building resilience. We used a pragmatic theoretical approach with a mixed methods methodology, to categorise the results within three distinct levels (individual, school/department, and institution), supporting the design and implementation of resilience-building strategies for academics and institutional leaders. We found that support, community, leadership, and planning at universities are critical in building and inhibiting resilience. Participants reported several ‘high impact’ incentives, addressing multiple barriers, that could be used to kick-start resilience. Online and flexible learning are key opportunities for resilience-building, but universities should not underestimate the importance of face-to-face interactions between staff and learners. Our results provide a strong starting point for practitioners and researchers aiming to understand how universities can foster resilience to major disruptions and disasters on university teaching.",2020-05-29,2020,Jacqueline Dohaney; Mairéad de Róiste; R.

W3172464731,The Role of Industry 4.0 Technologies in Mitigating Supply Chain Disruption: Empirical Evidence From the Australian Food Processing Industry,"Supply chain disruption refers to a breakdown, often caused by an unforeseen incident or risk, in a supply chain's production or distribution process.Contemporary supply chains are globalized, complex, and extended, exhibiting an increased vulnerability to a multitude of risks and disruptions.However, the current trend of real-time data exchange through smart technologies, also known as industry 4.0, provides significant opportunities to reshape the conventional business operations and effectively cope with unanticipated supply chain breakdowns.Yet, limited attention has been paid to the role played by industry 4.0 technologies in mitigating supply chain risks and any resulting disruptions.By bringing together these inter-related yet often separate concepts, we devise a novel model that addresses this knowledge gap.In this article, we empirically test our model on a sample of 302 responses received from senior managers of the Australian food processing industry.We found that supply-demand mismatch, process risks, and transportation risks are currently the major sources of supply chain disruptions.Specifically, supply-demand mismatch appears to be the most severe and attention seeking risk, followed by process and transportation risks.We also reveal that industry 4.0 technologies significantly mitigate supply-demand mismatch and process risks and any resulting supply chain disruptions.Contrary to our expectations, however, the impact of industry 4.0 technologies on transportation risks is found to be positive but nonsignificant.This is the first empirical article to assess the extent to which the three critical supply chain risks may undermine firm performance and to explore the moderating effect of industry 4.0 technologies.We draw managers' attention to the detrimental impact of supply chain disruptions and the significance of industry 4.0 technologies in dealing with adversities.",2021-07-02,2021,Imran Ali; Ahmad Arslan; Zaheer Khan; Shlomo Y.

W3008357833,Entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance in Italian firms,"Purpose Considering that context is important and relying on a contingency perspective, the purpose of the study is to analyze the relationship between an entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and firm performance in one of the world's oldest economies: Italy. The contingency perspective relies on competitive strategy as a moderating variable. Design/methodology/approach Using a mix of primary and secondary data sources, relationships are explored in a sample of 229 Italian for-profit firms. Moderated regression analysis is used for the sample and additional tests are conducted by firm size groupings. Findings The analysis suggests that an EO is positively associated with firm performance in the sample firms. Further, competitive strategy acts as a moderating influence: a low-cost strategy negatively influences the relationship, while a differentiation strategy positively influences the relationship. The firm size groupings do not appear to affect the results. Research limitations/implications The study examines only for-profit firms in a single country, Italy; therefore, generalizability is limited. The results must be interpreted in light of these limitations. Originality/value This study contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by considering a relatively new international context in the EO–firm performance relationship. Further, a new contingency perspective is advanced by considering competitive strategy. In doing so, this study extends an understanding of the conditions under which an EO might be associated with firm performance.",2020-02-26,2020,Jeremy Galbreath; Lorenzo Lucianetti; Ben W.

W3010868040,Did awarding badges increase data sharing in<i>BMJ Open</i>? A randomized controlled trial,"Sharing data and code are important components of reproducible research. Data sharing in research is widely discussed in the literature; however, there are no well-established evidence-based incentives that reward data sharing, nor randomized studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of data sharing policies at increasing data sharing. A simple incentive, such as an Open Data Badge, might provide the change needed to increase data sharing in health and medical research. This study was a parallel group randomized controlled trial (protocol registration: doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/PXWZQ ) with two groups, control and intervention, with 80 research articles published in BMJ Open per group, with a total of 160 research articles. The intervention group received an email offer for an Open Data Badge if they shared their data along with their final publication and the control group received an email with no offer of a badge if they shared their data with their final publication. The primary outcome was the data sharing rate. Badges did not noticeably motivate researchers who published in BMJ Open to share their data; the odds of awarding badges were nearly equal in the intervention and control groups (odds ratio = 0.9, 95% CI [0.1, 9.0]). Data sharing rates were low in both groups, with just two datasets shared in each of the intervention and control groups. The global movement towards open science has made significant gains with the development of numerous data sharing policies and tools. What remains to be established is an effective incentive that motivates researchers to take up such tools to share their data.",2020-03-01,2020,Anisa Rowhani-Farid; Adrian Aldcroft; Adrian Barnett,Queensland University of Technology,Royal Society Open Science,84,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.191818,Advanced_Manufacturing,Data sharing; Incentive; Randomized controlled trial; Protocol (science); Open data,0.15
W3087442911,CEO power and corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure: does stakeholder influence matter?,"Purpose This study examines the association between Chief Executive Officer (CEO) power and the level of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure, as well as the moderating role of stakeholder influence on this association. Design/methodology/approach Using a sample of 986 Bangladeshi firm-year observations, this study uses a content analysis technique to develop a 24-item CSR disclosure index. The ordinary least squares regression method is used to estimate the research models, controlling for firm-specific factors that potentially affect the levels of CSR disclosure. Findings The study findings indicate that CEO power is negatively associated with the level of CSR disclosure, and that the negative effects of CEO power on the level of CSR disclosure are attenuated by stakeholder influence. CEO power is documented as reducing the positive impact of CSR disclosure on a firm’s financial performance, with this negative impact attenuated if stakeholders have greater influence on the firm. Practical implications This study suggests that CEO power and stakeholder influence are important factors in determining firms’ incentives to disclose CSR information. Both CEO power and stakeholder influence need to be considered in the CSR – firm performance nexus, given the mixed findings documented in the literature. Originality/value This study makes a significant contribution to the literature on CSR practices by documenting that firms with a powerful CEO have lower levels of CSR disclosure, and that stakeholder influence affects CSR disclosure in the emerging economy context.",2020-09-21,2020,Afzalur Rashid; Syed Shams; Sudipta Bose; Habib Zaman Khan,University of Southern Queensland,Managerial Auditing Journal,82,https://doi.org/10.1108/maj-11-2019-2463,Advanced_Manufacturing,Corporate social responsibility; Stakeholder; Business; Accounting; Stakeholder theory,0.3
W3183831424,Facts and Figures on Materials Science and Nanotechnology Progress and Investment,"As the twenty-first century unfolds, nanotechnology is no longer just a buzzword in the field of materials science, but rather a tangible reality. This is evident from the surging number of commercial nanoproducts and their corresponding revenue generated in different industry sectors. However, it is important to recognize that sustainable growth of nanotechnology is heavily dependent on government funding and relevant national incentive programs. Consequently, proper analyses on publicly available nanotechnology data sets comprising information on the past two decades can be illuminating, facilitate development, and amend previous strategies as we move forward. Along these lines, classical statistics and machine learning (ML) allow processing large data sets to scrutinize patterns in materials science and nanotechnology research. Herein, we provide an analysis on nanotechnology progress and investment from an unbiased, computational vantage point and using orthogonal approaches. Our data reveal both well-established and surprising correlations in the nanotechnology field and its actors, including the interplay between the number of research institutes-industry, publications-patents, collaborative research, and top contributors to nanoproducts. Overall, data suggest that, supported by incentive programs set out by stakeholders (researchers, funding agencies, policy makers, and industry), nanotechnology could experience an exponential growth and become a centerpiece for economical welfare.

W3148744012,Coalition Graph Game-Based P2P Energy Trading With Local Voltage Management,"In this paper, the feasibility of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in a voltage-constrained grid-connected network is studied. In particular, a local voltage management scheme is proposed that takes network constraints into consideration to instruct the prosumers to trade energy frequently in the P2P market. A coalition graph game-based P2P energy trading framework is developed, in which prosumers can form the coalition to negotiate and decide on the energy trading parameters, such as trading quantities and prices. The Myerson value rule is used to allocate the total payoff of the proposed game fairly among the participating prosumers. Further, the stability of the proposed coalition structure is confirmed. Several simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the developed P2P trading model. The simulation results show that the proposed P2P trading framework can enable prosumers to export power without causing high voltage problem in the network, and help prosumers cut down a significant portion of their overall electricity costs compared to the feed-in-tariff and coalition game model without mutual negotiations.",2021-03-31,2021,M.

W3125572105,Brain-inspired spiking neural networks for decoding and understanding muscle activity and kinematics from electroencephalography signals during hand movements,"Abstract Compared to the abilities of the animal brain, many Artificial Intelligence systems have limitations which emphasise the need for a Brain-Inspired Artificial Intelligence paradigm. This paper proposes a novel Brain-Inspired Spiking Neural Network (BI-SNN) model for incremental learning of spike sequences. BI-SNN maps spiking activity from input channels into a high dimensional source-space which enhances the evolution of polychronising spiking neural populations. We applied the BI-SNN to predict muscle activity and kinematics from electroencephalography signals during upper limb functional movements. The BI-SNN extends our previously proposed eSPANNet computational model by integrating it with the ‘NeuCube’ brain-inspired SNN architecture. We show that BI-SNN can successfully predict continuous muscle activity and kinematics of upper-limb. The experimental results confirmed that the BI-SNN resulted in strongly correlated population activity and demonstrated the feasibility for real-time prediction. In contrast to the majority of Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs) that constitute a ‘black box’, BI-SNN provide quantitative and visual feedback about the related brain activity. This study is one of the first attempts to examine the feasibility of finding neural correlates of muscle activity and kinematics from electroencephalography using a brain-inspired computational paradigm. The findings suggest that BI-SNN is a better neural decoder for non-invasive BCI.",2021-01-28,2021,Kaushalya Kumarasinghe; Nikola Kasabov; Denise Taylor,Auckland University of Technology,Scientific Reports,75,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-81805-4,Advanced_Manufacturing,Brain–computer interface; Spiking neural network; Electroencephalography; Computer science; Brain activity and meditation,0.283
W3174879140,Exploring panic buying behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic: a developing country perspective,"Purpose This paper aims to identify factors that influence customers' panic buying behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 357 participants in Fiji, and structural equation modeling to analyze the collected data. Findings Results indicate that expected personal outcomes is positively associated with customers' attitudes while expected community-related outcomes negatively impact customers' attitudes. Factors such as attitude, subjective norms, scarcity, time pressure and perceived competition were found to positively influence customers' panic buying intention. Furthermore, scarcity and time pressure were confirmed to positively influence perceived competitiveness while perceived social detection risk negatively influences customer's panic buying intention. Practical implications The findings highlight the need for better measures to ensure that every customer has access to goods and services and is not deprived of such necessities in times of a crisis. These results will assist store managers and policymakers in introducing better management, social policies and resource utilization mechanisms to mitigate panic buying during the pandemic. Originality/value This study's findings contribute to the literature on customer's panic buying behavior during a global pandemic. Research in this area remain scarce, inconsistent and inconclusive. Novel insights are generated as this study is the first to combine the theory of planned behavior, privacy calculus theory and protection motivation theory. Applying these theories allows new relationships to be tested to better understand customer behavior during a global pandemic.

W4280598345,Incorporating <scp>AI</scp> and learning analytics to build trustworthy peer assessment systems,"Abstract Peer assessment has been recognised as a sustainable and scalable assessment method that promotes higher‐order learning and provides students with fast and detailed feedback on their work. Despite these benefits, some common concerns and criticisms are associated with the use of peer assessments (eg, scarcity of high‐quality feedback from peer student‐assessors and lack of accuracy in assigning a grade to the assessee) that raise questions about their trustworthiness. Consequently, many instructors and educational institutions have been anxious about incorporating peer assessment into their teaching. This paper aims to contribute to the growing literature on how AI and learning analytics may be incorporated to address some of the common concerns associated with peer assessment systems, which in turn can increase their trustworthiness and adoption. In particular, we present and evaluate our AI‐assisted and analytical approaches that aim to (1) offer guidelines and assistance to student‐assessors during individual reviews to provide better feedback, (2) integrate probabilistic and text analysis inference models to improve the accuracy of the assigned grades, (3) develop feedback on reviews strategies that enable peer assessors to review the work of each other, and (4) employ a spot‐checking mechanism to assist instructors in optimally overseeing the peer assessment process. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Engaging students in peer assessment has been demonstrated to have various benefits. However, there are some common concerns associated with employing peer assessment that raise questions about their trustworthiness as an assessment item. What this paper adds Methods and processes on how AI and learning analytics may be incorporated to address some of the common concerns associated with peer assessment systems, which in turn, can increase their trustworthiness and adoption.

W3159948963,Sustainable food drying technologies based on renewable energy sources,"Waste in the food supply chain is estimated to be about 30-40% of the total food production, which aggravates the world hunger and increases waste management burden and environmental impact. Despite the dire food scarcity, majority of this food waste takes place in developing countries because of the lack of appropriate and affordable preservation techniques. Traditional open sun drying is the most popular food-reservation technique to the local farmers due to near-zero capital cost and cheap labor cost. However, this method is highly energy intensive, unhygienic, and time demanding. The high energy consumption resulting from uncontrolled simultaneous heat, mass, and momentum transfer processes in traditional drying systems highlights the necessity of pursuing sustainability in drying process targeting reduced energy consumption, environmental and social impacts. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the sustainable food drying technologies based on renewable energy sources, with emphasis on the developing countries. It was observed that the integration of thermal energy storage with heat pump makes the integrated drying system more efficient, and dries food with better quality. Likewise, advanced integrated drying systems, such as, solar with microwave, and heat pump with microwave make the drying process more cost and quality competent. Finally, impact of resource distribution and governmental incentives for renewable energy use in sustainable drying is discussed.",2021-04-27,2021,Hang Qu; Mahadi Hasan Masud; Majedul Islam; Md.

Thus, the data-sharing privacy exposure issue is increasingly intimidating when IoT devices make malicious requests for filching sensitive information from a cloud storage system through edge nodes. To address the identified issue, we present evolutionary privacy preservation learning strategies for an edge computing-based IoT data sharing scheme. In particular, we introduce evolutionary game theory and construct a payoff matrix to symbolize intercommunication between IoT devices and edge nodes, where IoT devices and edge nodes are two parties of the game. IoT devices may make malicious requests to achieve their goals of stealing privacy. Accordingly, edge nodes should deny malicious IoT device requests to prevent IoT data from being disclosed. They dynamically adjust their own strategies according to the opponent's strategy and finally maximize the payoffs. Built upon a developed application framework to illustrate the concrete data sharing architecture, a novel algorithm is proposed that can derive the optimal evolutionary learning strategy. Furthermore, we numerically simulate evolutionarily stable strategies, and the final results experimentally verify the correctness of the IoT data sharing privacy preservation scheme. Therefore, the proposed model can effectively defeat malicious invasion and protect sensitive information from leaking when IoT data is shared.",2022-05-14,2022,Yizhou Shen; Shigen Shen; Qi Li; Haiping Zhou; Zongda Wu,Deakin University,Digital Communications and Networks,71,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcan.2022.05.004,Advanced_Manufacturing,Computer science; Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution; Correctness; Edge computing; Data sharing,0.283
W3166078487,Cooperative Target Enclosing of Ring-Networked Underactuated Autonomous Surface Vehicles Based on Data-Driven Fuzzy Predictors and Extended State Observers,"This article addresses the cooperative target enclosing problem of ring-networked underactuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). The target velocity is unavailable, and the ASVs are subject to sideslip effects, unknown control gains, and uncertain kinetics. The control objective is to drive a fleet of ASVs to surround a moving target at a desired range and maintain a spaced formation. An integrated distributed guidance and model-free control method is presented based on extended state observers (ESOs) and a data-driven fuzzy predictor. Specifically, by using two ESOs to estimate the unknown relative kinematics induced by the unknown target velocity and unknown sideslip and a distributed target estimator to recover the target position, intermediate range keeping and phase keeping guidance laws are designed to achieve a circular motion and an evenly spaced formation, respectively. Next, a model-free fuzzy control law is developed based on a data-driven fuzzy predictor, which learns the unknown control gains and uncertain kinetics simultaneously. Finally, the closed-loop control system is proven to be input-to-state stable through Lyapunov analysis. The salient feature of the proposed method is that cooperative circumnavigating a maneuvering target with unknown velocity can be achieved without the global target information and knowledge of vehicle kinetics. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed guidance and control method for cooperative target enclosing of ASVs.",2021-06-09,2021,Yue Jiang; Zhouhua Peng; Dan Wang; Yong Yin; Qing‐Long Han,Swinburne University of Technology,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,70,https://doi.org/10.1109/tfuzz.2021.3087920,Advanced_Manufacturing,Underactuation; Control theory (sociology); Kinematics; Fuzzy logic; Computer science,0.583
W3159687793,Designing flow regimes to support entire river ecosystems,"Overcoming challenges of water scarcity necessitates creative flow management approaches that account for multiple, potentially competing water needs of plants and animals in river ecosystems. Mechanistic multispecies models can guide decision making by evaluating trade‐offs associated with flow regimes designed for specific ecosystem outcomes before implementation. We investigated the cross‐ecosystem effects of environmental flow regimes designed to benefit focal groups of riparian vegetation, fishes, and invertebrates. The models revealed trade‐offs among different designer flow regimes with narrow taxonomic targets, which in some cases caused non‐target taxa to become locally extirpated within short (decadal) timespans. By incorporating multiple flow frequencies – from intra‐annual‐scale pulses to large decadal‐scale floods – the simulated natural flow regime enabled balanced, albeit smaller, population sizes across the three ecosystem components: 72% of that achieved by designer flow regimes, on average. Although returning to a natural flow regime may not be possible in highly flow‐modified rivers, novel flow regimes must incorporate diverse flood and drought frequencies to accommodate the occasionally conflicting requirements of different taxa at different times.",2021-05-03,2021,Jonathan D.

W3164999294,Network-Based Line-of-Sight Path Tracking of Underactuated Unmanned Surface Vehicles With Experiment Results,"This article deals with the problem of network-based path-tracking control of an underactuated unmanned surface vehicle subject to model uncertainties and unknown disturbances over a wireless network. A two-level network-based control architecture is proposed, including a local inner loop and a remote outer loop. In the remote outer loop, an event-triggered line-of-sight guidance law is designed to achieve path tracking while reducing the network burden for the remote control at the kinematic level. In the local inner loop, an extended state observer is employed to estimate the unknown disturbances due to the model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. Based on the estimated information from the extended state observer, an event-triggered anti-disturbance control law is developed to reduce the execution rate of actuators at the kinetic level. The stability of the closed-loop path-tracking system is proved based on the input-to-state stability and cascade stability theory. The effectiveness of the proposed network-based method for path tracking of the USV is verified via experiments.",2021-05-25,2021,Wentao Wu; Zhouhua Peng; Dan Wang; Lu Liu; Qing‐Long Han,Swinburne University of Technology,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,69,https://doi.org/10.1109/tcyb.2021.3074396,Advanced_Manufacturing,Underactuation; Control theory (sociology); Kinematics; Computer science; Observer (physics),0.433
W4294549672,Digitalization and the Anthropocene,"Great claims have been made about the benefits of dematerialization in a digital service economy. However, digitalization has historically increased environmental impacts at local and planetary scales, affecting labor markets, resource use, governance, and power relationships. Here we study the past, present, and future of digitalization through the lens of three interdependent elements of the Anthropocene: ( a) planetary boundaries and stability, ( b) equity within and between countries, and ( c) human agency and governance, mediated via ( i) increasing resource efficiency, ( ii) accelerating consumption and scale effects, ( iii) expanding political and economic control, and ( iv) deteriorating social cohesion. While direct environmental impacts matter, the indirect and systemic effects of digitalization are more profoundly reshaping the relationship between humans, technosphere and planet. We develop three scenarios: planetary instability, green but inhumane, and deliberate for the good. We conclude with identifying leverage points that shift human–digital–Earth interactions toward sustainability.",2022-09-03,2022,Felix Creutzig; Daron Acemoğlu; Xuemei Bai; Paul Edwards; Marie Josefine Hintz,Australian National University,Annual Review of Environment and Resources,69,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-environ-120920-100056,Advanced_Manufacturing,Anthropocene; Planetary boundaries; Sustainability; Politics; Natural resource economics,0.3
W4205214004,Generalized Virtual Synchronous Generator Control Design for Renewable Power Systems,"Grid-forming inverters (GFMIs) are recognized as one of the key enablers towards highly renewable energy proliferated grids. One of the pivotal characteristicsof GFMIs is the ability to seamlessly switch between grid-connected (GC) and standalone (SA) modes. In this paper, a novel controller is proposed to accurately follow the power reference commands in the GC mode while providing the required amount of virtual inertia in the SA mode to slow down the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) following a disturbance. The proposed control design, where straightforward equations are given to calculate the controller gains directly, is based on the frequency response of the open-loop system. Furthermore, based on the frequency response of the controller, a condition for the placement of the poles of the controller is derived to guarantee the RoCoF relay limit compliance in the SA mode. The experimental results show that the proposed controller results in lower overshoots and shorter settling times in step responses in the GC mode than the virtual synchronous generator (VSG) controller while providing more virtual inertia than the VSG controller to slow down RoCoF in the SA mode. Furthermore, the experimental results illustrate that the proposed controller can also be designed to support the grid during frequency transients. The performance of the controller is extensively validated experimentally during GC to SA mode transition and vice versa, in a multi-inverter network, and in a wide-area model.",2022-01-18,2022,Dayan B.

W4285091133,Top‐management compensation and environmental innovation strategy,"Abstract The increasing awareness of global climate change puts more pressure on firms to reduce their environmental externalities. Managers long ignored this responsibility, which may erode business profits, going against their traditional goals. In this study, we examine the effect of top management's extrinsic incentives (i.e., reward‐driven motivation) on corporate environmental innovation strategy (i.e., eco‐innovation) using a large dataset of S&amp;P1500 non‐financial firms for 2000–2020. The results indicate that firms with greater levels of top‐management compensation exhibit higher scores of eco‐innovation engagement. The effect holds after we address the endogeneity problem through the quasi‐natural experiment using the difference‐in‐differences analysis on the event of the Paris Agreement 2015. Our further investigations reveal that such a positive impact of managerial incentives on eco‐innovation is less intensified in the more polluting industries but more pronounced in more innovative ones.",2022-07-12,2022,Giang Phung; Hai Hong Trinh; Tam Nguyen; Vu Quang Trinh,Massey University,Business Strategy and the Environment,68,https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.3209,Advanced_Manufacturing,Incentive; Endogeneity; Compensation (psychology); Externality; Business,0.225
W3133704997,High performance work systems and innovation in New Zealand SMEs: testing firm size and competitive environment effects,"While the links between High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) and performance are established, we extend this literature by (1) focusing on new products/services innovation and (2) testing relationships on SMEs (up to 250 employees). Specifically, we test a path model whereby HPWS influences human capital and ultimately innovation. Furthermore, to better understand potential resource differences within SMEs of different size, and the business environment context operated in, we also test (3) firm size and (4) competitive rivalry as moderators. Combining these factors, we test moderated mediation models and use a sample of 253 SMEs with time-lagged data. Findings show HPWS are positively related to a firm's human capital and innovation, and the direct effect of HPWS is partially mediated by human capital. Moderation effects highlight that firm size is most important, with larger SMEs outperforming smaller SMEs only when they have high HPWS. Greater competitive rivalry in conjunction with HPWS (2-way) and for larger SMEs (3-way) produces the highest levels of human capital. Finally, a moderated mediation effect is found for firm size, showing that the indirect effect of HPWS on innovation (through human capital) strengthens as SMEs get larger. The implications for HPWS and SME innovation are discussed.",2021-03-08,2021,Jarrod Haar; Conor O’Kane; Urs Daellenbach,Auckland University of Technology,The International Journal of Human Resource Management,67,https://doi.org/10.1080/09585192.2021.1894213,Advanced_Manufacturing,Moderated mediation; Mediation; Work systems; Business; Human capital,0.3
W3193951062,Investigating the Impact of Economic Uncertainty on Optimal Sizing of Grid-Independent Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems,"One of the many barriers to decarbonization and decentralization of the energy sector in developing countries is the economic uncertainty. As such, this study scrutinizes economics of three grid-independent hybrid renewable-based systems proposed to co-generate electricity and heat for a small-scale load. Accordingly, the under-study systems are simulated and optimized with the aid of HOMER Pro software. Here, a 20-year average value of discount and inflation rates is deemed a benchmark case. The techno-economic-environmental and reliability results suggest a standalone solar/wind/electrolyzer/hydrogen-based fuel cell integrated with a hydrogen-based boiler system is the best alternative. Moreover, to ascertain the impact of economic uncertainty on optimal unit sizing of the nominated model, the fluctuations of the nominal discount rate and inflation, respectively, constitute within the range of 15–20% and 10–26%. The findings of economic uncertainty analysis imply that total net present cost (TNPC) fluctuates around the benchmark value symmetrically between $478,704 and $814,905. Levelized energy cost varies from an amount 69% less than the benchmark value up to two-fold of that. Furthermore, photovoltaic (PV) optimal size starts from a value 23% less than the benchmark case and rises up to 55% more. The corresponding figures for wind turbine (WT) are, respectively, 21% and 29%. Eventually, several practical policies are introduced to cope with economic uncertainty.",2021-08-23,2021,Mostafa Rezaei; Udaya Dampage; Barun K. Das; Omaima Nasif; Piotr F.

W4226160308,"A Review of Cable-Driven Parallel Robots: Typical Configurations, Analysis Techniques, and Control Methods","Cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) have applications in large workspaces and at high operating speeds, which necessitates considering the mass and elasticity of cables for accurate analyses of kinematics, dynamics, workspace, trajectory planning, and control. In this article, first, the typical CDPR configurations along with their application areas are summarized. Then, various approaches, such as optimizing cable and motor configurations or integrating additional elements to the structure of CDPRs that can be used for workspace geometry optimization, are discussed. Afterward, different models for the cables with mass and elasticity, such as Irvine's sagging or spring dampers studied in the literature for integrating into the kinematics and dynamics equations, are reported. Later, along with reviewing different approaches for trajectory planning of planar and spatial CDPRs, advances in configuration optimization for collision-free trajectory planning are addressed. Finally, kinematic and dynamic control algorithms to handle the effect of mass and elasticity of the cables and robust and adaptive control algorithms to tackle structured and unstructured uncertainties, such as in the mass and moment of the moving platform (MP) and external disturbances, are reported.",2022-03-30,2022,Mahmoud Zarebidoki; Jaspreet Singh Dhupia; Wei Xu,University of Auckland,IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine,66,https://doi.org/10.1109/mra.2021.3138387,Advanced_Manufacturing,Workspace; Kinematics; Trajectory; Robot; Control theory (sociology),0.225
W3138224606,The impact of the interaction between an entrepreneurial marketing orientation and coopetition on business performance,"Purpose Certain small businesses do not possess the assets needed to implement a performance-enhancing entrepreneurial marketing orientation (opportunity-driven behaviours focussed on creating value for customers). Although some entrepreneurs cooperate with their competitors (coopetition) to achieve their day-to-day and long-term goals, it is unclear whether these partnerships are advantageous in this capacity. Thus, grounded in the resource-based view, the purpose of this investigation is to examine whether coopetition positively moderates the relationship between an entrepreneurial marketing orientation and financial performance. Design/methodology/approach Survey responses were obtained from 184 small tourism and hospitality organisations in New Zealand. Following a series of robustness checks, covariance-based structural equation modelling was used to test the elements of the conceptual model. Findings Unique insights illustrate an entrepreneurial marketing orientation yielding a negative and significant link with financial performance. Nevertheless, this result was potentially related to the entrepreneurial marketing-oriented opportunities that owner-managers pursued within the context of their sector; in particular, situations when employing an individualistic business model constrained certain decision-makers' ability to pursue “growth-oriented” objectives. However, coopetition produced a positive and significant moderating effect, enabling owner-managers to pursue opportunities via collaborative business models facilitating mutually beneficial performance outcomes. Practical implications Owner-managers of under-resourced small firms should be careful when implementing entrepreneurial marketing strategies utilising an individualistic business model. For example, they might pursue opportunities that are not viable and/or become over-loaded with market intelligence that they cannot handle. By collaborating with competitors, owner-managers can learn improved ways to operate within their industries, alongside being equipped with new resources and capabilities. In doing so, coopetition can help overcome some of the potential performance-limiting issues owner-managers face by being under-resourced, namely, via employing a collaborative business model. Originality/value This current study contributes to the extant literature by evaluating the complexities of entrepreneurial marketing practices. That is, although earlier research has focussed on the performance-driving outcomes of an entrepreneurial marketing orientation, prior studies typically overlook certain moderating factors that could influence this association. By examining the interaction between an entrepreneurial marketing orientation and coopetition on financial performance, new evidence has emerged on how owner-managers of small firms can utilise interfirm collaboration to succeed within their markets, as opposed to struggling to cope with the challenges of an individualistic business model. Specifically, an entrepreneurial marketing orientation is likely to enhance financial performance when under-resourced companies effectively collaborate with their competitors.",2021-03-19,2021,James M.

W3207602870,Cooperative Task Offloading and Block Mining in Blockchain-Based Edge Computing With Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning,"The convergence of mobile edge computing (MEC) and blockchain is transforming the current computing services in mobile networks, by offering task offloading solutions with security enhancement empowered by blockchain mining. Nevertheless, these important enabling technologies have been studied separately in most existing works. This article proposes a novel cooperative task offloading and block mining (TOBM) scheme for a blockchain-based MEC system where each edge device not only handles data tasks but also deals with block mining for improving the system utility. To address the latency issues caused by the blockchain operation in MEC, we develop a new Proof-of-Reputation consensus mechanism based on a lightweight block verification strategy. A multi-objective function is then formulated to maximize the system utility of the blockchain-based MEC system, by jointly optimizing offloading decision, channel selection, transmit power allocation, and computational resource allocation. We propose a novel distributed deep reinforcement learning-based approach by using a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. We then develop a game-theoretic solution to model the offloading and mining competition among edge devices as a potential game, and prove the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate the significant system utility improvements of our proposed scheme over baseline approaches.",2021-10-15,2021,Dinh C. Nguyen; Ming Ding; Pubudu N.

Payment for ecosystem service (PES) schemes provide a viable avenue for funding large-scale wetland restoration. However, schemes around the globe differ substantially in their goals, structure, challenges, and effectiveness in supporting large-scale wetland restoration. Here, we suggest wetland-based PES schemes use common asset trusts (CATs) to build investment portfolios of wetlands across landscapes that sustain and enhance overall provision of multiple ecosystem services. CATs can meet the needs of multiple investors, permit bundled payments, and provide flexibility to invest in the restoration of numerous services/values, all using a coordinated, highly collaborative, prioritized, and transparent process. CATs would support financial viability, facilitate efficiency to reduce administrative burdens, and enable credibility and social licence building to restore wetland values and services globally.",2021-07-01,2021,Adam D.

W4224018334,Corporates’ sustainability disclosures impact on cost of capital and idiosyncratic risk,"Purpose This study aims to investigate not only the association between corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance and the cost of capital (COC) but also its impact on the company’s idiosyncratic risk. Further, it highlights that companies could manage their risk through sustainability initiatives to achieve a cheaper cost of financing. Design/methodology/approach Using an extensive Australian sample for the 2007–2017 period from the Bloomberg database, this study conducts a panel (data) regression analysis to examine the impact of the corporate ESG performance disclosure score on the COC and idiosyncratic risk. The robustness of the findings is tested and confirmed in several ways, including a sensitivity test. Furthermore, the instrumental variable approach is used to address potential endogeneity issues. Findings A favourable association was found between a higher corporate ESG performance disclosure score and cheaper resources financing. The evidence also supports the mitigating impact of corporate ESG performance disclosure score on the company’s idiosyncratic risk as a strong complement for access to a cheaper source of funds. The findings strongly support both hypotheses of this study. Research limitations/implications This study extends the current body of knowledge addressing these associations. Further studies should expand the investigation to non-listed or small and medium-sized companies. Additionally, future studies could contribute to the literature by including other moderating variables, such as a country’s cultural environment and diverse economic situations.

W3215458820,Spatial Correlation Network and Regional Differences for the Development of Digital Economy in China,"The rapid development of the digital economy is a powerful driving force to promote high-quality economic growth all over the world. Although a number of studies have been conducted to investigate the development of the digital economy in China, these studies pay little attention to the spatial linkages between the 30 provinces in China and the developmental differences between northern and southern China. Using Chinese digital economic data from 2004 to 2019, we propose an index system to measure the developmental levels of the digital economy and obtain the annual developmental levels of these provinces by using the factor analysis method. We analyze the regional differences of developmental levels by using the Theil index and kernel density estimation method. More importantly, the network method is used to analyze the correlations between the developmental levels of the digital economy in all provinces of China. By decomposing regional differences, our study shows that polarized and uncoordinated development is prominent. The development level of the digital economy in the southern region is higher than that in the northern region. In terms of regional correlations, the network study suggests that there are beneficial and spillover effects of the digital economy development between provinces. Based on the analysis results, we propose policies for improving the development of the digital economy in China.",2021-11-25,2021,Luyang Tang; Bangke Lu; Tianhai Tian,Monash University,Entropy,62,https://doi.org/10.3390/e23121575,Advanced_Manufacturing,China; Spillover effect; Index (typography); Theil index; Shift-share analysis,0.375
W4214913046,The eye of the storm: a regular Kerr black hole,"Abstract We analyse in some detail a highly tractable non-singular modification of the Kerr geometry, dubbed the “eye of the storm” — a rotating regular black hole with an asymptotically Minkowski core. This is achieved by “exponentially suppressing” the mass parameter in the Kerr spacetime: m → m e - ℓ/r . The single suppression parameter ℓ quantifies the deviation from the usual Kerr spacetime. Some of the classical energy conditions are globally satisfied, whilst certain choices for ℓ force any energy-condition-violating physics into the deep core. The geometry possesses the full “Killing tower” of principal tensor, Killing-Yano tensor, and nontrivial Killing tensor, with associated Carter constant; hence the Hamilton-Jacobi equations are separable, and the geodesics integrable. Both the Klein-Gordon equation and Maxwell's equations are also separable on this candidate spacetime. The tightly controlled deviation from Kerr renders the physics extraordinarily tractable when compared with analogous candidates in the literature. This spacetime will be amenable to straightforward extraction of astrophysical observables falsifiable/ verifiable by the experimental community.",2022-03-01,2022,Alex Simpson; Matt Visser,Victoria University of Wellington,Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics,61,https://doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2022/03/011,Advanced_Manufacturing,Physics; Spacetime; Black hole (networking); Rotating black hole; Geodesic,0.225
W4285393284,Circular Economy in the Construction Industry: A Step towards Sustainable Development,"Construction is a resource-intensive industry where a circular economy (CE) is essential to minimize global impacts and conserve natural resources. A CE achieves long-term sustainability by enabling materials to circulate along the critical supply chains. Accordingly, recent research has proposed a paradigm shift towards CE-based sustainability. However, uncertainties caused by fluctuating raw material prices, scarce materials, increasing demand, consumers’ expectations, lack of proper waste infrastructure, and the use of wrong recycling technologies all lead to complexities in the construction industry (CI). This research paper aims to determine the enablers of a CE for sustainable development in the CI. The system dynamics (SD) approach is utilized for modeling and simulation purposes to address the associated process complexity. First, using content analysis of pertinent literature, ten enablers of a CE for sustainable development in CI were identified. Then, causality among these enablers was identified via interviews and questionnaire surveys, leading to the development of the causal loop diagram (CLD) using systems thinking. The CLD for the 10 shortlisted enablers shows five reinforcing loops and one balancing loop. Furthermore, the CLD was used to develop an SD model with two stocks: “Organizational Incentive Schemes” and “Policy Support.” An additional stock (“Sustainable Development”) was created to determine the combined effect of all stocks. The model was simulated for five years. The findings show that policy support and organizational incentive schemes, among other enablers, are critical in implementing a CE for sustainable development in CI. The outcomes of this study can help CI practitioners to implement a CE in a way that drives innovation, boosts economic growth, and improves competitiveness.",2022-07-13,2022,Maria Ghufran; Khurram Iqbal Ahmad Khan; Fahim Ullah; Abdur Rehman Nasir; Ahmad Aziz Alahmadi,University of Southern Queensland,Buildings,59,https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings12071004,Advanced_Manufacturing,Causal loop diagram; Circular economy; Sustainability; Incentive; Business,0.375

W4206003068,"Participatory Governance of Smart Cities: Insights from e-Participation of Putrajaya and Petaling Jaya, Malaysia","Participatory governance is widely viewed as an essential element of realizing planned smart cities. Nonetheless, the implementation of e-participation platforms, such as the websites and mobile applications of civic authorities, often offer ambiguous information on how public voices may influence e-decision-making. This study aims to examine the status of participatory governance from the angle of e-participation platforms and from the broader scope of linking e-platforms to a smart city blueprint. In order to achieve this aim, the study focuses on shedding light on the e-governance space given to smart city realization in a developing country context—i.e., Malaysia. The Putrajaya and Petaling Jaya smart cities of Malaysia were selected as the testbeds of the study, which used the multiple case study methodology and multiple data collection designs. The analyses were done through the qualitative observations and quantitative descriptive statistics. The results revealed that both of the investigated smart city cases remained limited in their provision of e-decision-making space. The inefficiency of implementing planned initiatives to link the city blueprints to e-platforms was also evidenced. The study evidenced that the political culture of e-decision-making is undersized in Malaysia, which hinders the achievement of e-democracy in the smart cities’ development.

W4295015842,Buffer bots: The role of virtual service agents in mitigating negative effects when service fails,"Abstract In recent years, marketers have placed increased reliance upon artificial intelligence (AI) and, subsequently, the use of virtual agents in customer service contexts is on the rise. Despite such service digitalization, service can still fail. While there is an increasing literature on the effect of virtual agents in service settings, questions remain as to how customers react to service failure that results from interactions with virtual service agents. To this end, we deconstruct the effect of virtual agent service failure across two studies: one involving a process service failure and another involving an outcome service failure. We specifically manipulate the type of service agent that causes the service failure (human vs. virtual agent) and the magnitude of the failure (small vs. large). Results show that firms can leverage virtual service agents to mitigate or buffer the negative effects of service failure. From a managerial perspective, our findings suggest that firms could engage virtual service agents in situations where there may be a risk of outcome service failure—particularly in settings where relatively large magnitude failures may be experienced. In such a setting, we find that virtual service agents can mitigate the negative effects of service failure, more so than when the failure results from an interaction with a human service agent.",2022-09-07,2022,Sean Sands; Colin Campbell; Kirk Plangger; Leyland Pitt,Swinburne University of Technology,Psychology and Marketing,54,https://doi.org/10.1002/mar.21723,Advanced_Manufacturing,Service (business); Service recovery; Leverage (statistics); Service delivery framework; Outcome (game theory),0.15
W4226264323,Cooperative Target Tracking of Multiple Autonomous Surface Vehicles Under Switching Interaction Topologies,"This paper is concerned with the cooperative target tracking of multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) under switching interaction topologies. For the target to be tracked, only its position can be measured/received by some of the ASVs, and its velocity is unavailable to all the ASVs. A distributed extended state observer taking into consideration switching topologies is designed to integrally estimate unknown target dynamics and neighboring ASVs' dynamics. Accordingly, a novel kinematic controller is designed, which takes full advantage of known information and avoids the approximation of some virtual control vectors. Moreover, a disturbance observer is presented to estimate unknown time-varying environmental disturbance. Furthermore, a distributed dynamic controller is designed to regulate the involved ASVs to cooperatively track the target. It enables each ASV to adjust its forces and moments according to the received information from its neighbors. The effectiveness of the derived results is demonstrated through cooperative target tracking performance analysis for a tracking system composed of five interacting ASVs.",2022-04-08,2022,Lang Ma; Yu‐Long Wang; Qing‐Long Han,Swinburne University of Technology,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,53,https://doi.org/10.1109/jas.2022.105509,Advanced_Manufacturing,Network topology; Control theory (sociology); Tracking (education); Kinematics; Controller (irrigation),0.45
W4307285208,Extrinsic and intrinsic motives: panic buying and impulsive buying during a pandemic,"Purpose The present study operationalizes and tests the impact of extrinsic (store environment, promotional activities) and intrinsic (hedonism, materialism) variables on impulsive buying during the COVID-19 period. It also considers the dual-factor approach (panic and impulsive buying tendency) using the “Stimulus-Organism-Response” approach and “Dual-Factor Theory”. Design/methodology/approach Purposive sampling was used to obtain data from 362 responses from retail shoppers and analyzed by path analysis. The moderation of novel constructs (scarcity and COVID-19 pandemic) examines the backdrop of retail impulse shopping. Findings The store environment has a detrimental effect on panic and impulsive buying. Promotional activities have a beneficial effect on impulsive buying tendency. Similarly, hedonism and materialism have a substantial positive effect on panic and impulsive buying tendencies. Between stimulus (intrinsic and extrinsic) and response variables, organism factors (panic and impulsive buying inclinations) influenced positively (impulsive buying); in terms of moderation, scarcity and the COVID-19 pandemic exhibit substantial moderation between organism and response. Originality/value The results contribute substantially to the existing domain of customers’ panic and impulsive purchasing behavior for the scarcity of essential items during the COVID-19 epidemic. Research in this field is limited, varied and inconclusive. New insights were obtained as this research blends the “Stimulus-Organism-Response” and Dual factor theories.",2022-10-24,2022,Rambabu Lavuri; Deepak Jaiswal; Park Thaichon,Griffith University,International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management,53,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijrdm-01-2022-0010,Advanced_Manufacturing,Moderation; Scarcity; Materialism; Psychology; Originality,0.225
W4321483382,Towards nutrient neutrality: A review of agricultural runoff mitigation strategies and the development of a decision-making framework,"Nutrient runoff from agriculture practices poses a significant risk to waterway health and can have long-lasting and complex implications for the environment, ecosystems, and the human population. Consequently, a systematic quantitative literature review (SQLR) was conducted to identify different nutrient runoff mitigation strategies (NRMS) that are currently used globally to prevent or remediate environmental damage from excessive agricultural fertilisation. Empirical data on the outcomes from various NRMS from the reviewed studies were used to evaluate the strategies based on environmental benefit, implementation cost, and practicality perspectives. An overall assessment of the feasibility of NRMS was determined, and a macro-level assessment of the reported barriers preventing the widespread implementation of NRMS was provided. Identified research gaps and issues included a dearth of literature covering nutrient runoff mitigation, scepticism from agricultural landowners to voluntarily adopt policy without substantial incentives, and a general lack of cost/benefit analyses, including an understanding of the uncertainty associated with NRMS that can inform decision-makers about effective and efficient strategies for different site situations. Synthesis of SQLR data facilitated the development of a comprehensive nutrient runoff decision-making framework which addresses present limitations and provides site-specific NRMS recommendations for policymakers to implement.",2023-02-22,2023,Martin Jason Luna Juncal; Pietro Masino; Edoardo Bertone; Rodney A.

W4206554014,"Total reward system, job satisfaction and employee productivity on company financial performance: evidence from Indonesian Generation Z workers","Purpose The study of monetary and non-monetary rewards from the human resource management (HRM) perspective has rarely been analyzed so far. There has been extensive study on HRM, yet only a few studies explicitly discuss the correlation between the adoption of a total reward system (TRS) and employee-related outcomes. This paper aims to analyze this important issue to provide inputs for organizations to design compensation strategies that will impact on company’s financial performance with employee productivity and job satisfaction as mediating variables specifically for Generation Z. Design/methodology/approach A survey was conducted on 40 companies operating in the service sector in Indonesia. The authors captured the overall TRS result on three outcome variables (i.e. job satisfaction, employee productivity and financial performance). Furthermore, the authors examine the impact of TRS (base pay, training and development and positive work environment) on Generation Z workers. Structural equation modeling analysis was conducted on 40 Indonesian, service industry, listed firms with an average of 6 representatives per firm. Findings The results validate that the adoption of a TRS exerts a positive influence on the aforementioned outcomes. However, the interesting fact about the finding is that Generation Z cannot be easily satisfied with only monetary incentives; their preference has shifted from monetary concerns to self-capability. Practical implications The empirical result suggests that TRS serves as a tool in encouraging employees and boosting productivity. Accordingly, firms should incorporate TRS practices to enhance job satisfaction and productivity, as well as sustain the relationship with stakeholders. Subsequently, management should also be concerned with maintaining good employee productivity to improve a company’s financial performance by supervising and monitoring company operations, as well as ensuring the fulfillment of the stakeholder’s interests. Originality/value This paper provides original insights into the complex relationship between TRS and the aforementioned outcomes, such as job satisfaction, employee productivity and financial performance.",2022-01-17,2022,Josua Tarigan; Jordan Cahya; Albert Valentine; Saarce Elsye Hatane; Ferry Jie,Edith Cowan University,Journal of Asia Business Studies,52,https://doi.org/10.1108/jabs-04-2021-0154,Advanced_Manufacturing,Job satisfaction; Productivity; Business; Incentive; Human resource management,0.45
W4224950683,"Incentive Mechanisms for Smart Grid: State of the Art, Challenges, Open Issues, Future Directions","Smart grids (SG) are electricity grids that communicate with each other, provide reliable information, and enable administrators to operate energy supplies across the country, ensuring optimized reliability and efficiency. The smart grid contains sensors that measure and transmit data to adjust the flow of electricity automatically based on supply/demand, and thus, responding to problems becomes quicker and easier. This also plays a crucial role in controlling carbon emissions, by avoiding energy losses during peak load hours and ensuring optimal energy management. The scope of big data analytics in smart grids is huge, as they collect information from raw data and derive intelligent information from the same. However, these benefits of the smart grid are dependent on the active and voluntary participation of the consumers in real-time. Consumers need to be motivated and conscious to avail themselves of the achievable benefits. Incentivizing the appropriate actor is an absolute necessity to encourage prosumers to generate renewable energy sources (RES) and motivate industries to establish plants that support sustainable and green-energy-based processes or products. The current study emphasizes similar aspects and presents a comprehensive survey of the start-of-the-art contributions pertinent to incentive mechanisms in smart grids, which can be used in smart grids to optimize the power distribution during peak times and also reduce carbon emissions. The various technologies, such as game theory, blockchain, and artificial intelligence, used in implementing incentive mechanisms in smart grids are discussed, followed by different incentive projects being implemented across the globe. The lessons learnt, challenges faced in such implementations, and open issues such as data quality, privacy, security, and pricing related to incentive mechanisms in SG are identified to guide the future scope of research in this sector.",2022-04-27,2022,Sweta Bhattacharya; Rajeswari Chengoden; Gautam Srivastava; Mamoun Alazab; Abdul Rehman Javed,Charles Darwin University,Big Data and Cognitive Computing,52,https://doi.org/10.3390/bdcc6020047,Advanced_Manufacturing,Smart grid; Incentive; Environmental economics; Computer science; Renewable energy,0.525
W4206390406,Resilience of Organizations in the Construction Industry in the Face of COVID-19 Disturbances: Dynamic Capabilities Perspective,"The construction industry has been significantly impacted by the economic, financial, and operational consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because the pandemic continues to evolve, this study aimed to better understand its impact and propose a roadmap to support the survival and recovery of construction organizations through a two-stage research design. The first stage of this study built upon the economic contagion literature to empirically examine the magnitude and severity of the impacts of the pandemic on construction organizations globally. A joint contagion model, the crisis severity index, and Student t-tests were used to analyze the longitudinal daily stock prices and indices collected from 80 construction organizations and the Chinese and US stock markets, spanning both the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods (i.e., a total of 840 observations). The results showed the extent of the impact of the pandemic within the construction industry and its varying severity levels over time across regions in a pattern that is consistent with the spread of the pandemic itself. These findings urgently call for construction organizations to plan their response strategies for short-term and long-term performance. Accordingly, a systematic literature review was conducted in the second stage of this study to synthesize the best practices undertaken by construction organizations in the face of historical economic downturns. Specifically, the theoretical lenses of dynamic capabilities and organizational resilience were applied to synthesize the literature to develop an evidence-based roadmap. Construction organizations can use this roadmap to systematically scan their environments for threats or opportunities (i.e., sensing), formulate suitable responsive strategies (i.e., seizing), and build their resilience over time (i.e., reconfiguration). These insights can help them to survive, recover, and even thrive in the face of the pandemic and build resilience in the anticipation of future disturbances.",2022-01-12,2022,Ying‐Yi Chih; Cody Yu‐Ling Hsiao; Ali Zolghadr; Nader Naderpajouh,Australian National University,Journal of Management in Engineering,51,https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)me.1943-5479.0001014,Advanced_Manufacturing,Stock (firearms); Psychological resilience; Resilience (materials science); Pandemic; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),0.3
W4225424643,Effects of the energy transition on environmental impacts of cobalt supply: A prospective life cycle assessment study on future supply of cobalt,"Abstract Cobalt is considered a key metal in the energy transition, and demand is expected to increase substantially by 2050. This demand is for an important part because of cobalt use in (electric vehicle) batteries. This study investigated the environmental impacts of the production of cobalt and how these could change in the future. We modeled possible future developments in the cobalt supply chain using four variables: (v1) ore grade, (v2) primary market shares, (v3) secondary market shares, and (v4) energy transition. These variables are driven by two metal‐demand scenarios, which we derived from scenarios from the shared socioeconomic pathways, a “business as usual” (BAU) and a “sustainable development” (SD) scenario. We estimated future environmental impacts of cobalt supply by 2050 under these two scenarios using prospective life cycle assessment. We found that the environmental impacts of cobalt production could likely increase and are strongly dependent on the recycling market share and the overall energy transition. The results showed that under the BAU scenario, climate change impacts per unit of cobalt production could increase by 9% by 2050 compared to 2010, while they decreased by 28% under the SD scenario. This comes at a trade‐off to other impacts like human toxicity, which could strongly increase in the SD scenario (112% increase) compared to the BAU scenario (71% increase). Furthermore, we found that the energy transition could offset most of the increase of climate change impacts induced by a near doubling in cobalt demand in 2050 between the two scenarios.",2022-04-05,2022,Marc van der Meide; Carina Harpprecht; Stephen Northey; Yongxiang Yang; Bernhard Steubing,University of Technology Sydney,Journal of Industrial Ecology,51,https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.13258,Advanced_Manufacturing,Cobalt; Scenario analysis; Life-cycle assessment; Climate change; Production (economics),0.358
W4296050840,Economic policy uncertainty and firm propensity to invest in corporate social responsibility,"Purpose This study aims to examine the impact of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on firm investment in corporate social responsibility (CSR)’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) dimensions. Additionally, the study examines whether firm size moderates the EPU–CSR relationship. Design/methodology/approach The sample includes 2,017 US. firms from 2002 to 2018. Data on ESG scores are drawn from the Asset-4 database in Thomson Reuters to measure CSR investment. ordinary least square regression, including fixed effects at the year and industry level, is used as the main econometric specification. Moreover, the study employed the two-step system Generalized Method of Moments to address the endogeneity concerns. Findings The findings reveal that firms increase their CSR investment in response to high EPU. The results are consistent in all the three ESG/CSR dimensions: ESG. Moreover, the positive association between EPU and CSR is driven by firm size, indicating that large-sized firms have the resources and incentives to invest more in CSR. Our main findings remain consistent after addressing the endogeneity concerns and controlling for the effect of omitted variable biasness. Originality/value Using a unique sample of US firms, this study empirically contributes to the current literature on the association between EPU and CSR investment. Moreover, firm size plays a vital role in moderating this relationship.",2022-09-16,2022,Muhammad Ilyas; Rehman Uddin Mian; Muhammad Tahir Suleman,University of Otago,Management Decision,50,https://doi.org/10.1108/md-06-2021-0746,Advanced_Manufacturing,Corporate social responsibility; Endogeneity; Investment (military); Incentive; Corporate governance,0.375
W4205551906,Field theory spin and momentum in water waves,"Spin is a fundamental yet nontrivial intrinsic angular momentum property of quantum particles or fields, which appears within relativistic field theory. The spin density in wave fields is described by the theoretical Belinfante-Rosenfeld construction based on the difference between the canonical and kinetic momentum densities. These quantities are usually considered as abstract and non-observable per se. Here, we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that the Belinfante-Rosenfeld construction naturally arises in gravity (water surface) waves. There, the canonical momentum is associated with the generalized Stokes drift phenomenon, while the spin is generated by subwavelength circular motion of water particles. Thus, we directly observe these fundamental field theory properties as microscopic mechanical properties of a classical wave system. Our findings shed light onto the nature of spin and momentum in wave fields, demonstrate the universality of relativistic field theory concepts, and offer a new platform for their studies.",2022-01-21,2022,Konstantin Y.

W4323844334,Assessing Supply Chain Innovations for Building Resilient Food Supply Chains: An Emerging Economy Perspective,"Food waste reduction and security are the main concerns of agri-food supply chains, as more than thirty-three percent of global food production is wasted or lost due to mismanagement. The ongoing challenges, including resource scarcity, climate change, waste generation, etc., need immediate actions from stakeholders to develop resilient food supply chains. Previous studies explored food supply chains and their challenges, barriers, enablers, etc. Still, there needs to be more literature on the innovations in supply chains that can build resilient food chains to last long and compete in the post-pandemic scenario. Thus, studies are also required to explore supply chain innovations for the food sector. The current research employed a stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) to assess the supply chain innovations that can develop resilient food supply chains. This study is a pioneer in using the SWARA application to evaluate supply chain innovation and identify the most preferred alternatives. The results from the SWARA show that ‘Business strategy innovations’ are the most significant innovations that can bring resiliency to the food supply chains, followed by ‘Technological innovations.’ The study provides insights for decision makers to understand the significant supply chain innovations to attain resilience in food chains and help the industry to survive and sustain in the long run.",2023-03-09,2023,S.

W4303045581,Consumers' preference for eco-friendly packaged products: pride vs guilt appeal,"Purpose This paper aims to examine the influence of eco-friendly packaging on consumers' responses. A research framework is examined to identify significant antecedents of eco-friendly packaging behaviour, namely environmental responsibility, knowledge, attitudes, and message framing, to determine their relative importance. Design/methodology/approach A set of hypotheses is tested across two studies. Findings Study 1 ( n = 160) shows that attitude is an important mediator between consumers' environmental responsibility and environmental knowledge and intentions when adopting eco-friendly packaging. Furthermore, study 2 ( n = 132) finds that where eco-friendly packaging is concerned, the advertised message has to be framed with a particular emotional appeal congruent to a specific psychographic trait to stimulate pro-environmental behavioural intention. Practical implications Based on the findings of this research, advertisers and environmental practitioners can utilise the correct type of message appeals to implement pro-environmental campaigns and programs for appropriate consumer segments effectively.

W4306399828,The development trends of existing building energy conservation and emission reduction—A comprehensive review,"The energy conservation of existing buildings plays a significant role in reducing global carbon emissions and building energy consumption. The research on building energy conservation focuses on discussing existing and new buildings. However, the research on energy conservation of existing buildings is relatively single, and there is a lack of systematic and in-depth review. Based on the bibliometric and qualitative analysis methods, this study selects the relevant literature from 2008 to 2022 for network mapping analysis and summarizes the research results. The seven indicators of impact factor, total publications, average publication year, total/average citations, and total/average normative citations were selected to analyze the selected articles by country, institution, journal, keywords, and highly cited literature. Three major research themes of existing building energy efficiency are obtained by analyzing the quantitative results of keywords and highly cited literature: (1) influencing factors and energy-saving obstacles of energy consumption, (2) energy-saving measures, and (3) energy-saving optimization and its evaluation method. Finally, based on the bibliometric results, this research qualitatively analyzes the highly cited literature and the latest research results to obtain the future development trends and possible directions of energy conservation in the existing buildings throughout their life cycle. This study provides innovative ideas for the energy-saving renovation of existing buildings: (1) Technology empowerment (using renewable energy, negative carbon technology, ""artificial intelligence + Internet of Things + 5G"" and cogeneration, etc.) and (2) Formulating regulations and policy incentives for different decision-makers (implementing demand response strategies such as time-of-use pricing to guide and restrict user behavior, considering carbon tax and carbon trading, etc.). on the premise of utilizing renewable energy and increasing the capacity resilience of the distribution grids, the existing buildings will be energy-efficient, economical, intelligent and comfortable in the future.",2022-10-17,2022,He Huang; Honglei Wang; Yujie Hu; Chengjiang Li; Xiaolin Wang,University of Tasmania,Energy Reports,48,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2022.10.023,Advanced_Manufacturing,Environmental economics; Energy conservation; Incentive; Energy consumption; Renewable energy,0.45
W4309194892,The role of incentive mechanisms in promoting forest restoration,"Forest restoration has been proposed as a scalable nature-based solution to achieve global environmental and socio-economic outcomes and is central to many policy initiatives, such as the Bonn Challenge. Restored forests contain appreciable biodiversity, improve habitat connectivity and sequester carbon. Incentive mechanisms (e.g. payments for ecosystem services and allocation of management rights) have been a focus of forest restoration efforts for decades. Yet, there is still little understanding of their role in promoting restoration success. We conducted a systematic literature review to investigate how incentive mechanisms are used to promote forest restoration, outcomes, and the biophysical and socio-economic factors that influence implementation and program success. We found that socio-economic factors, such as governance, monitoring systems and the experience and beliefs of participants, dominate whether or not an incentive mechanism is successful. We found that approximately half of the studies report both positive ecological and socio-economic outcomes. However, reported adverse outcomes were more commonly socio-economic than ecological. Our results reveal that achieving forest restoration at a sufficient scale to meet international commitments will require stronger assessment and management of socio-economic factors that enable or constrain the success of incentive mechanisms.

W4311764991,Direct discovery of the inner exoplanet in the HD 206893 system,"Aims. HD 206893 is a nearby debris disk star that hosts a previously identified brown dwarf companion with an orbital separation of ∼10 au. Long-term precise radial velocity (RV) monitoring, as well as anomalies in the system proper motion, has suggested the presence of an additional, inner companion in the system. Methods. Using information from ongoing precision RV measurements with the HARPS spectrograph, as well as Gaia host star astrometry, we have undertaken a multi-epoch search for the purported additional planet using the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument. Results. We report a high-significance detection over three epochs of the companion HD 206893c, which shows clear evidence for Keplerian orbital motion. Our astrometry with ∼50−100 μarcsec precision afforded by GRAVITY allows us to derive a dynamical mass of 12.7$ ^{+1.2}_{-1.0} $ M Jup and an orbital separation of 3.53$ ^{+0.08}_{-0.06} $ au for HD 206893c. Our fits to the orbits of both companions in the system use both Gaia astrometry and RVs to also provide a precise dynamical estimate of the previously uncertain mass of the B component, and therefore allow us to derive an age of 155 ± 15 Myr for the system. We find that theoretical atmospheric and evolutionary models that incorporate deuterium burning for HD 206893c, parameterized by cloudy atmosphere models as well as a “hybrid sequence” (encompassing a transition from cloudy to cloud-free), provide a good simultaneous fit to the luminosity of both HD 206893B and c. Thus, accounting for both deuterium burning and clouds is crucial to understanding the luminosity evolution of HD 206893c. Conclusions. In addition to using long-term RV information, this effort is an early example of a direct imaging discovery of a bona fide exoplanet that was guided in part by Gaia astrometry. Utilizing Gaia astrometry is expected to be one of the primary techniques going forward for identifying and characterizing additional directly imaged planets. In addition, HD 206893c is an example of an object narrowly straddling the deuterium-burning limit but unambiguously undergoing deuterium burning. Additional discoveries like this may therefore help clarify the discrimination between a brown dwarf and an extrasolar planet. Lastly, this discovery is another example of the power of optical interferometry to directly detect and characterize extrasolar planets where they form, at ice-line orbital separations of 2−4 au.",2022-12-15,2022,Sasha Hinkley; S.

Yet, people with knee osteoarthritis have difficulties with other activities and there are a lack of studies using IMU training data from this population. Our objective was to conduct a proof-of-concept study to determine the feasibility of using IMU training data from people with knee osteoarthritis performing multiple clinically important activities to predict knee joint sagittal plane kinematics using a deep learning approach. We trained a bidirectional long short-term memory model on IMU data from 17 participants with knee osteoarthritis to estimate knee joint flexion kinematics for phases of walking, transitioning to and from a chair, and negotiating stairs. We tested two models, a double-leg model (four IMUs) and a single-leg model (two IMUs). The single-leg model demonstrated less prediction error compared to the double-leg model. Across the different activity phases, RMSE (SD) ranged from 7.04° (2.6) to 11.78° (6.04), MAE (SD) from 5.99° (2.34) to 10.37° (5.44), and Pearson's R from 0.85 to 0.99 using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation.

W4224286299,Pressure–Strain Interaction as the Energy Dissipation Estimate in Collisionless Plasma,"Abstract The dissipative mechanism in weakly collisional plasma is a topic that pervades decades of studies without a consensus solution. We compare several energy dissipation estimates based on energy transfer processes in plasma turbulence and provide justification for the pressure–strain interaction as a direct estimate of the energy dissipation rate. The global and scale-by-scale energy balances are examined in 2.5D and 3D kinetic simulations. We show that the global internal energy increase and the temperature enhancement of each species are directly tracked by the pressure–strain interaction. The incompressive part of the pressure–strain interaction dominates over its compressive part in all simulations considered. The scale-by-scale energy balance is quantified by scale filtered Vlasov–Maxwell equations, a kinetic plasma approach, and the lag dependent von Kármán–Howarth equation, an approach based on fluid models. We find that the energy balance is exactly satisfied across all scales, but the lack of a well-defined inertial range influences the distribution of the energy budget among different terms in the inertial range. Therefore, the widespread use of the Yaglom relation in estimating the dissipation rate is questionable in some cases, especially when the scale separation in the system is not clearly defined. In contrast, the pressure–strain interaction balances exactly the dissipation rate at kinetic scales regardless of the scale separation.",2022-04-01,2022,Yan Yang; W. H. Matthaeus; Sohom Roy; V.

W4220747783,Numerical simulation of a non-linear nanofluidic model to characterise the MHD chemically reactive flow past an inclined stretching surface,"A computational approach is delineated for mass and heat transport enhancement/reduction process to control the drift of nanofluid. The fluid is drifting on the inclined stretched surface. This numerical study demands the resolution of fundamental (conservation momentum, mass transfer, and energy) equations and for which computational proficiency is a challenge. The time-dependent concentration and temperature on the periphery, together with stretched velocity, are the basis of the transient mixed convective laminar nanofluid flow. A similar transformations technique is imposed to adopt a system of time dominated non-linear fundamental equations and transformed it into a differential equation of the ordinary system. It is solved computationally by utilising the scheme of Nactsheim–Swigert shooting along with the iteration process, namely Runge–Kutta of order six. The obtained model depends on diversified natural parameters and is narrated on several profiles. Moreover, an explicit scheme has also been imposed to illustrate the developed visualisation of the fluid flow with the aid of streamlines and isothermal lines. Here, the stretching parameter demonstrates a provoking character on the momentum boundary layer, and the Prandtl number depicts an insignificant minimal impact on the mass transfer flow. The accuracy of this model is found satisfactory by validating with experimental data and comparing it with the previous numerical tests. This investigation has applications in engineering industries in thermal nano-technological materials processing and manufactures.",2022-03-16,2022,Sk. Reza‐E‐Rabbi; Md. Shakhaoath Khan; S. M.

W4281255193,Tuning particle inertial separation in sinusoidal channels by embedding periodic obstacle microstructures,"Inertial microfluidics functions solely based on the fluid dynamics at relatively high flow speed. Thus, channel geometry is the critical design parameter that contributes to the performance of the device. Four basic channel geometries (i.e., straight, expansion-contraction, spiral and serpentine) have been proposed and extensively studied. To further enhance the performance, innovative channel design through combining two or more geometries is promising. This work explores embedding periodic concave and convex obstacle microstructures in sinusoidal channels and investigates their influence on particle inertial focusing and separation. The concave obstacles could significantly enhance the Dean flow and tune the flow range for particle inertial focusing and separation. Based on this finding, we propose a cascaded device by connecting two sinusoidal channels consecutively for rare cell separation.

W4362717752,Examining the environmental aspect of economic complexity outlook and environmental-related technologies in the Nordic states,"Understanding the outlook of countries' economic complexity is vital for assessing the future of industries' product characterization. It provides opportunity and insight on how to mitigate the negative externalities that arises from the increasing pressure on the ecosystem. Based on this account, the effect of economic complexity and the corresponding outlook on environmental degradation vis-a-vis greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions alongside other environmental indicators are examined for the panel of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden for the period 1995 to 2020. After employing Driscoll- Kraay's standard errors for random effect (RE) with individual effects for the examination, the results indicate that the region's level of economic complexity favors environmental sustainability. Contrarily, the economic complexity outlook spurs GHG emissions, thus suggesting that future performance of the region's economic complexity could be detrimental to its ecosystem. Another similar, and undesirable observation is that the increase in urban population hampers environmental quality as it causes a surge in GHG emissions. Meanwhile, the results then conclude that economic growth, economic complexity, and environmental-related technologies are found to be potent drivers of environmental sustainability as the indicators exert negative pressure on GHG emissions in the Nordic region. Important policies that potentially guide immediate, and future sector-wide activities toward enhancing the region's sustainable development programs are posited through the study outcome.",2023-04-08,2023,Andrew Adewale Alola; Ali Çeli̇k; Usama Awan; İbrahim Abdallah; Hephzibah Onyeje Obekpa,Torrens University Australia,Journal of Cleaner Production,44,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.137154,Advanced_Manufacturing,Greenhouse gas; Sustainability; Externality; Natural resource economics; Environmental degradation,0.225
W4385989064,A new framework for electricity price forecasting via multi-head self-attention and CNN-based techniques in the competitive electricity market,"Due to recent technical improvements, the smart grid has become a feasible platform for electricity market participants to successfully regulate their bidding process based on demand-side management (DSM) perspectives. At this level, practical design, implementation, and assessment of numerous demand response mechanisms and robust short-term price forecasting development in day-ahead transactions are all critical. The accuracy and effectiveness of the day-ahead price forecasting process are crucial concerns in a deregulated market. In this market, the reason for low accuracy is the limitation of electricity generation compared to the electricity demand variations. Hence, this study proposes a suitable technique for forecasting electricity prices using a multi-head self-attention and Convolutional Neural networks (CNN) based approach. Further, this study develops a feature selection technique using mutual information (MI) and neural networks (NN) to choose suitable input variable subsets significantly affecting electricity price predictions simultaneously. The combination of MI and NN reduces the number of input features used in the model, thereby decreasing the computational complexity of the NN. The actual data sets from the Ontario electricity market in 2020 are acquired to verify the simulation results. Finally, the simulation results proved the efficiency of the proposed method by demonstrating increased accuracy by attaining the lowest average value for MAPE and RMSE with a value of 1.75% and 0.0085, respectively, and compared to results obtained by recent computational intelligence approaches. By attaining accurate electricity price results, the significance of this study can be summed up as aiding the electricity industry's operators in administering effective energy management, efficient resource allocation, and informed decision-making.",2023-08-18,2023,Alireza Pourdaryaei; Mohammad Mohammadi; Hamza Mubarak; Abdallah Abdellatif; Mazaher Karimi,Griffith University,Expert Systems with Applications,43,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.121207,Advanced_Manufacturing,Electricity price forecasting; Electricity market; Computer science; Bidding; Electricity,0.717
W4387733210,"Two-step deep learning framework with error compensation technique for short-term, half-hourly electricity price forecasting","Prediction of electricity price is crucial for national electricity markets supporting sale prices, bidding strategies, electricity dispatch, control and market volatility management. High volatility, non-stationarity and multi-seasonality of electricity prices make it significantly challenging to estimate its future trend, especially over near real-time forecast horizons. An error compensation strategy that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) algorithm is proposed to predict the half-hourly step electricity prices. A prediction model incorporating VMD and CLSTM is first used to obtain an initial prediction. To improve its predictive accuracy, a novel error compensation framework, which is built using the VMD and a Random Forest Regression (RF) algorithm, is also used. The proposed VMD-CLSTM-VMD-ERCRF model is evaluated using electricity prices from Queensland, Australia. The results reveal highly accurate predictive performance for all datasets considered, including the winter, autumn, spring, summer, and yearly predictions. As compared with a predictive model without error compensation (i.e., the VMD-CLSTM model), the proposed VMD-CLSTM-VMD-ERCRF model outperforms the benchmark models. For winter, autumn, spring, summer, and yearly predictions, the average Legates and McCabe Index is seen to increase by 15.97%, 16.31%, 20.23%, 10.24%, and 14.03%, respectively, relative to the benchmark models. According to the tests performed on independent datasets, the proposed VMD-CLSTM-VMD-ERCRF model can be a practical stratagem useful for short-term, half-hourly electricity price forecasting. Therefore the research outcomes demonstrate that the proposed error compensation framework is an effective decision-support tool for improving the predictive accuracy of electricity price. It could be of practical value to energy companies, energy policymakers and national electricity market operators to develop their insight analysis, electricity distribution and market optimization strategies.",2023-10-18,2023,Sujan Ghimire; Ravinesh C.

W4390453080,"Economics of renewable hydrogen production using wind and solar energy: A case study for Queensland, Australia","This study presents a technoeconomic analysis of renewables-based hydrogen production in Queensland, Australia under Optimistic, Reference and Pessimistic scenarios to address uncertainty in cost predictions. The goal of the work was to ascertain if the target fam-gate cost of AUD 3/kg (approx. USD 2/kg) could be reached. Economies of scale and the learning rate concept were factored into the economic model to account for the effect of scale-up and cost reductions as electrolyser manufacturing capacity grows. The model assumes that small-scale to large-scale wind turbine (WT)-based and photovoltaic (PV)-based power generation plants are directly coupled with an electrolyser array and utilises hourly generation data for the Gladstone hydrogen-hub region. Employing first a commonly used simplified approach, the electrolyser array was sized based on the maximum hourly power available for hydrogen production. The initial results indicated that scale-up is very beneficial: the levelised cost of green hydrogen (LCOH) could decrease by 49% from $6.1/kg to $3.1/kg when scaling PV-based plant from 10 MW to 1 GW, and for WT-based plant by 36% from $5.8/kg to $3.7/kg. Then, impacts on the LCOH of incorporating curtailment of ineffective peak power and electrolyser overload capacity were investigated and shown to be significant. Also significant was the beneficial effect of recognising that electrolyser efficiency depends on input power. The latter two factors have mostly been overlooked in the literature. Incorporating in the model the influence on the LCOH of real-world electrolyser operational characteristics overcomes a shortcoming of the simplified sizing method, namely that a large portion of electrolyser capacity is under-utilised, leading to unnecessarily high values of the LCOH. It was found that AUD 3/kg is achievable if the electrolyser array is properly sized, which should help to incentivise large-scale renewable hydrogen projects in Australia and elsewhere.",2023-12-30,2023,Mostafa Rezaei; Alexandr Akimov; Evan Gray,Griffith University,Journal of Cleaner Production,40,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140476,Advanced_Manufacturing,Renewable energy; Environmental science; Hydrogen production; Wind power; Photovoltaic system,0.583

W4383336737,"Innovation and inter-city knowledge spillovers: Social, geographical, and technological connectedness and psychological openness","Knowledge spillovers across economic agents are central to the process of technological innovation. Yet, the mechanisms by which spillovers travel and manifest as innovation are poorly understood. To fill that gap, we study how knowledge spillovers emanating from other cities (knowledge pools) diffuse and get absorbed. We refine the notion of connectedness by comparing three mechanisms through which knowledge spillovers occur between cities (geographically, technologically, and socially via social media links). We also examine how local psychological openness facilitates this diffusion and absorption process. Using 360 U.S. cities as our empirical context, we find geographically mediated and socially mediated (but not technologically mediated) knowledge spillovers to show positive relationships with the rate of patenting. Moreover, results confirm a positive moderation effect of psychological openness on the relationship between socially mediated knowledge spillovers and the rate of patenting. By providing a more comprehensive test of knowledge spillover mechanisms, our study indicates that the often-quoted physical proximity to knowledge pools remains a robust driver. However, a city's virtual connection to knowledge pools (e.g., via social media links between people) also matter, particularly if that city is psychologically more open. This catalyst of local openness might occur because open populations better absorb inflowing knowledge and utilize it more effectively via key innovators. We discuss implications for research and policy with a particular focus on virtual human (vs. geographically bounded) connectedness and psychological openness as intertwined key areas of a new human geography of innovation.",2023-07-06,2023,Martin Obschonka; Sam Tavassoli; Peter J.

W4321783989,Joining Forces: The Spillover Effects of EPA Enforcement Actions and the Role of Socially Responsible Investors,"Abstract We find that firms reduce toxic emissions at their local plants following EPA enforcement actions against nearby plants operated by peer firms that compete in the same product market. These reductions are more pronounced for plants located near socially responsible mutual funds (SRMFs) that hold these plants’ parent firms’ shares. Close proximity to SRMFs is associated with real investment in abatement measures to mitigate emissions. While plants increase emissions again in the long run, such reversals do not occur in plants located near SRMFs. Taken together, our results suggest that local SRMFs complement EPA enforcement in influencing plants’ emissions.

W4375855696,"Energy justice, democracy and deforestation","This paper contributes to the debate on the determinants of deforestation, a menace that is posing threat to sustainable development particularly in tropical developing regions. Specifically, the paper focuses on the effect of energy justice and democratization. The main contribution to the literature hinges on the emphasis on energy justice - operationalized as rural-urban equality in access to electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking - and its interaction with democracy. Using a panel data of 47 sub-Saharan African countries over the period 2000-2020 and the dynamic two-step generalized method of moment estimator, the results generally indicate that improvement in rural-urban equality in access to electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking is associated with a reduction in deforestation. Democracy is similarly found to be associated with reduction in deforestation. The conditional effect analysis largely depicts an intensified reducing effect of energy justice on deforestation in the presence of improved democratic practices. The results though robust to an alternative estimator, the Driscoll-Kraay estimator, differ when sub-regional analysis is considered. The paper aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goals 7, 13, 15 and 16.",2023-05-05,2023,Alex O.

W4327588269,Effectiveness of H5P in improving student learning outcomes in an online tertiary education setting,"Innovative, pedagogically informed instructional design is instrumental in increasing student engagement and improving learning outcomes in online learning environments. Interactive learning resources provide students with the opportunity to engage with content in a more personalised manner. H5P (HTML 5 Package) is a collaborative platform that allows developers to create interactive content and has been regularly used in education settings. Some evidence suggests using interactive H5P resources in online education courses could lead to greater student engagement. However, to date, there has been little investigation into whether H5P resources can improve student learning outcomes. The current study aimed to assess whether using interactive H5P resources improved assessed learning outcomes in an online undergraduate psychology course. A randomized cross-over design was utilized to test whether students exposed to H5P interactive videos had improved assessment results when compared to a control group. This study found no meaningful differences in assessment scores between students exposed to H5P versus those that were not. There was low overall engagement with the interactive content. However, students who did engage with the resources reported a positive experience and indicated a preference for more interactive elements in future courses. Future research should extend on the instructional design obstacles identified in this study, for example, by examining whether improved accessibility and education on the benefits of interactive resources would increase engagement and grades.",2023-03-16,2023,Tarosh Thomas Jacob; Stephanie Centofanti,University of South Australia,Journal of Computing in Higher Education,34,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12528-023-09361-6,Advanced_Manufacturing,Student engagement; Psychology; Educational technology; Interactive Learning; Instructional design,0.225

To propose identifiable features of such models and support researchers to plan public health modeling projects using these models. A working group of experts in complex systems modeling and economic evaluation was brought together to develop and jointly write guidance for the use of complex systems models for health economic analysis.

A public health complex systems model for economic evaluation is defined as a quantitative, dynamic, non-linear model that incorporates feedback and interactions among model elements, in order to capture emergent outcomes and estimate health, economic and potentially other consequences to inform public policies. The guidance covers: when complex systems modeling is needed; principles for designing a complex systems model; and how to choose an appropriate modeling technique.

W4367016675,Secure Cooperative Path Following of Autonomous Surface Vehicles Under Cyber and Physical Attacks,"This paper is concerned with the networked cooperative path following (CPF) problem for multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) subject to simultaneous cyber and physical attacks. First, to compensate the adverse effects of the physical-attack-induced bias injections, an extended state observer is designed to provide real-time estimates of the unmeasured velocities and unknown nonlinear terms. Next, to identify and handle various cyber attacks, a novel secure data transmission mechanism, featuring a secure transmitter and a secure receiver, is developed for each ASV. Then, a secure CPF control scheme, consisting of a networked cooperative kinematic control law and a networked kinetic control law, is presented. Furthermore, the observer error dynamics and networked CPF error dynamics are derived to account for the simultaneous network-induced delays, packet dropouts, physical attacks, and cyber attacks. The proposed control scheme is capable to preserve satisfactory secure tracking performance of the resulting CPF control system under a desired reference path even in the presence of external environmental disturbances, delays, packet dropouts, and malicious attacks. Finally, several case studies are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the secure CPF control scheme.",2023-04-25,2023,Zhaoqing Liu; Xiaohua Ge; Qing‐Long Han; Yu‐Long Wang; Xian‐Ming Zhang,Swinburne University of Technology,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,32,https://doi.org/10.1109/tiv.2023.3270266,Advanced_Manufacturing,Cyber-physical system; Network packet; Computer science; Path (computing); Kinematics,0.867
W4315641269,Testing parity symmetry of gravity with gravitational waves,"The examination of parity symmetry in gravitational interactions has drawn increasing attention. Although Einstein’s General Relativity is parity-conserved, numerous theories of parity-violating (PV) gravity in different frameworks have recently been proposed for different motivations. In this review, we briefly summarize the recent progress of these theories, and focus on the observable effects of PV terms in the gravitational waves (GWs), which are mainly reflected in the difference between the left-hand and right-hand polarization modes. We are primarily concerned with the implications of these theories for GWs generated by the compact binary coalescences and the primordial GWs generated in the early Universe. The deviation of GW waveforms and/or primordial power spectrum can always be quantified by the energy scale of parity violation of the theory. Applying the current and future GW observation from laser interferometers and cosmic microwave background radiation, the current and potential constraints on the PV energy scales are presented, which indicates that the parity symmetry of gravity can be tested in high energy scale in this new era of gravitational waves.",2023-01-12,2023,Jin Qiao; Zhao Li; Tao Zhu; Ran Ji; Guoliang Li,Australian National University,Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences,31,https://doi.org/10.3389/fspas.2022.1109086,Advanced_Manufacturing,Physics; Gravitational wave; Parity (physics); Cosmic microwave background; Theoretical physics,0.15

In this context, the role of for‐profit organizations has become vital in addressing such challenges. Drawing on the strategy tripod perspective, this study investigated the influence of reverse engineering on frugal product‐innovation performance (PIP) through the mediating effect of frugal innovation (i.e., cost innovation, and affordable value innovation). In addition, we examined the moderating impact of the industry environment (i.e., technological turbulence) and institutional context (i.e., legal inefficiency) on this relationship.

W4391006085,Inertia emulation control of PMSG-based wind turbines for enhanced grid stability in low inertia power systems,"With increased penetration of the converter dominated renewables, the overall inertial response and frequency stability of the power grid has been reduced. Low inertia contributes to maximum frequency deviations with higher rate of change of frequency that undermines the reliability of the power system. In the case of type-4 grid connected wind turbines, the kinetic energy of the rotor cannot be directly used to mitigate frequency excursions in the AC grid since fully-rated converters decouple the grid from the turbine rotor. Nonetheless, by designing an adequate control system for full converters, emulated inertia of the rotor can be propagated to the grid. In this paper, we present inertia emulation control strategy based on second order differential equation analogous to the swing equation of classical synchronous machines employed in machine side converter of the permanent magnet synchronous generator wind turbines. The proposed control allows the management of virtual inertia, damping and reactance. The performance of the proposed controller is verified through time-domain simulations and eigenvalue analysis performed in MATLAB Simulink.",2024-01-19,2024,Asif Khan; D.A.

W4391321410,Scarcity and quality risks for future global urban water supply,"Abstract Context Supply of freshwater to the world’s cities is increasingly affected by human pressures and climate change. Understanding the effects of human pressures and climate change on global urban water scarcity and quality risks in an integrated way is important. Objectives The objective of this study is to assess the scarcity and quality risks to water security for 304 large cities (population &gt; 1 million) across the world for 2015 and 2050. Methods We assessed the water scarcity according to water demand and availability, and evaluated the quality of water supply in terms of the population density, cropland fertilization, and landscape patterns in source watersheds. In addition, the impacts of human pressures and climate change on urban water risks were quantified using contribution analysis. Results We found that about 90% of these cities faced water risks in 2015. The number of cities facing quality risk was about three times the number of cities facing scarcity risk, and nearly a quarter faced dual risks. From 2015 to 2050, 88.8–99.7% of cities were projected to face rising water risks with about one-third facing dual risks by 2050. Increase in water demand was the main cause of rising scarcity risk; growth in population and crop fertilization in source watersheds were the main reasons for rising quality risk. Conclusions There is an urgent need to promote landscape conservation of urban water source areas, implement sustainable urban water planning and governance, improve water supply infrastructure, and refine ecological compensation regimes to achieve global urban water security.",2024-01-29,2024,Zhifeng Liu; Jiahe Ying; Chunyang He; Dongjie Guan; Xinhao Pan,Deakin University,Landscape Ecology,24,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-024-01832-0,Advanced_Manufacturing,Scarcity; Landscape ecology; Nature Conservation; Environmental planning; Sustainable development,0.225
W4400900844,How much growth is required to achieve good lives for all? Insights from needs-based analysis,"Some narratives in international development hold that ending poverty and achieving good lives for all will require every country to reach the levels of GDP per capita that currently characterise high-income countries. However, this would require increasing total global output and resource use several times over, dramatically exacerbating ecological breakdown. Furthermore, universal convergence along these lines is unlikely within the imperialist structure of the existing world economy. Here we demonstrate that this dilemma can be resolved with a different approach, rooted in recent needs-based analyses of poverty and development. Strategies for development should not pursue capitalist growth and increased aggregate production as such, but should rather increase the specific forms of production that are necessary to improve capabilities and meet human needs at a high standard, while ensuring universal access to key goods and services through public provisioning and decommodification. At the same time, in high-income countries, less-necessary production should be scaled down to enable faster decarbonization and to help bring resource use back within planetary boundaries. With this approach, good lives can be achieved for all without requiring large increases in total global throughput and output. Provisioning decent living standards (DLS) for 8.5 billion people would require only 30% of current global resource and energy use, leaving a substantial surplus for additional consumption, public luxury, scientific advancement, and other social investments. Such a future requires planning to provision public services, to deploy efficient technology, and to build sovereign industrial capacity in the global South.",2024-07-23,2024,Jason Hickel; Dylan Sullivan,Macquarie University,World Development Perspectives,24,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wdp.2024.100612,Advanced_Manufacturing,Poverty; Production (economics); Consumption (sociology); Provisioning; Business,0.508

W4401209228,Techno-economics of offshore wind-based dynamic hydrogen production,"Given the urgent need to accelerate all renewable energy capacities for hydrogen production, this study undertakes a techno-economic analysis of dynamic hydrogen production using offshore wind energy under ""slow progress"" and ""fast progress"" scenarios. To ensure a reliable wind power generation profile and to avoid overestimating output power, the study takes into account significant impacts of air density and wind plant-level losses, including wake effect and turbine performance losses. The economic modelling incorporates costs associated with wind turbines, foundations, submarine connections, offshore substations, and installations. For modelling the system of electrolysis, a dynamic power-dependent efficiency representing PEM technology is employed. To reflect the influences of a realistic project on the estimation of the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH), economies of scale and learning rate models are incorporated. Australian offshore wind locations are selected as a case study for implementing the model because of the enormous available wind resource. The findings indicate that the variable nature of input power has a meaningful impact on the yearly average energy consumption of the electrolysis system. Comparing the scenarios, it becomes evident that rapid scaling up is required to achieve a cost-competitive LCOH in the coming decades. Should interest rates and thus costs of capital return to the levels closer to pre-pandemic levels, the LCOH level of below AUD3/kg (USD2/kg) can be achieved under the ""fast progress"" scenario in two Australian offshore wind locations by around 2040.",2024-08-01,2024,Mostafa Rezaei; Alexandr Akimov; Evan Gray,Griffith University,Applied Energy,23,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124030,Advanced_Manufacturing,Offshore wind power; Wind power; Renewable energy; Environmental science; Capital cost,0.867
W4400487169,Acceleration of phosphorus weathering under warm climates,"The release of phosphorous (P) via chemical weathering is a vital process that regulates the global cycling of numerous key elements and shapes the size of the Earth's biosphere. It has long been postulated that global climate should theoretically play a prominent role in governing P weathering rates. Yet, there is currently a lack of direct evidence for this relationship based on empirical data at the global scale. Here, using a compilation of temperature and P content data of global surface soils (0 to 30 cm), we demonstrate that P release does enhance at high mean annual surface temperatures. We propose that this amplification of nutrient supply with warming is a critical component of Earth's natural thermostat, and that this relationship likely caused expanded oceanic anoxia during past climate warming events. The potential acceleration of phosphorus loss from soils due to anthropogenic climate warming may pose threats to agricultural production, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and alter marine redox landscapes.",2024-07-10,2024,Licheng Guo; Shangfa Xiong; Benjamin Mills; Terry T.

This study aims to address the knowledge gap resulting from the limited uptake of MC in residential projects, mainly attributed to existing barriers. To accomplish this goal, a questionnaire survey was conducted to assess the significance of thirty adoption barriers. Subsequently, an exploratory factor analysis method was applied to categorize these barriers, followed by their assessment and ranking using fuzzy synthetic evaluation. A novel aggregation and ranking method that integrates the WASPAS and TOPSIS techniques for order preference, by similarity to an ideal solution approach, was employed. The rankings derived from different decision-making methods were combined using an ensemble approach based on half-quadratic theory. Our findings reveal that the adoption barriers can be grouped into five main categories, with cost, coordination, and standards emerging as the most prominent barriers. They are followed by technical and practical barriers, inflexibility and supply chain barriers, abilities and awareness barriers, and societal and desire-related barriers. The study results offer significant insights into the barriers impeding MC adoption in developing countries' construction sectors, providing recommendations to improve its uptake.",2024-01-04,2024,Ali Hassan Ali; Ahmed Farouk Kineber; Nehal Elshaboury; Mehrdad Arashpour; Ahmed Osama Daoud,Monash University,International Journal of Construction Management,20,https://doi.org/10.1080/15623599.2023.2299557,Advanced_Manufacturing,Ranking (information retrieval); TOPSIS; Categorization; Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Preference,0.225
W4392560385,Does digitalization enhance the effects of lean production on social performance?,"Purpose This study aims to investigate whether Industry 4.0 digital technologies can enhance the effects of lean production on social performance. Design/methodology/approach Survey data collected from China’s manufacturing industry are used to test research hypotheses. Findings The results reveal that the three dimensions of lean production (internal, customer and supplier) have a significant positive effect on social performance and that digital technology advancement (DTA) positively moderates these relationships. DTA adds only a marginal contribution to social performance. Practical implications This study addresses a new challenging question from manufacturing firms: how to integrate lean, technology and people? The empirical findings provide timely and insightful practical guidance for managers to better understand the role of digital transformation in the traditional lean context. Originality/value While digitalization is known to complement lean production, this study shows digitalization also complements the effects of lean production on social performance.",2024-03-07,2024,Roberto Chávez; Wantao Yu; Mark Jacobs; Chee Yew Wong,Swinburne University of Technology,International Journal of Operations & Production Management,19,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijopm-05-2023-0332,Advanced_Manufacturing,Lean manufacturing; Production (economics); Business; Operations management; Process management,0.658
W4405431371,"A systematic literature review of attitudes, intentions and behaviours of teaching academics pertaining to AI and generative AI (GenAI) in higher education: An analysis of GenAI adoption using the UTAUT framework","The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has outpaced existing research and regulatory frameworks in higher education, leading to varied institutional responses. Although some educators and institutions have embraced AI and generative AI (GenAI), other individuals remain cautious. This systematic literature review explored teaching academics' attitudes, perceptions and intentions towards AI and GenAI, identifying perceived benefits and obstacles. Utilising the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology framework, this study reveals positive attitudes towards AI's efficiency and teaching enhancement, but also significant concerns about academic integrity, accuracy, reliability, skill development and the need for comprehensive training and policies. These findings underscore the necessity for institutional support to navigate the integration of AI and GenAI in tertiary education. Implications for practice or policy: Attitudes towards AI and GenAI integration are diverse with educators recognising benefits but raising ethical and practical concerns. These concerns indicate a need for a more comprehensive understanding and dialogue within academic communities. Academics' intentions to use these technologies are contingent upon the development of robust ethical guidelines and supportive institutional policies. Institutional support and training shape behaviours.

W4390704975,Fundamental and Second-Order Superregular Breathers in Vector Fields,"We developed an exact theory of the superregular breathers (SRBs) of Manakov equations. We have shown that the vector SRBs do exist both in the cases of focusing and defocusing Manakov systems. The theory is based on the eigenvalue analysis and on finding the exact links between the SRBs and modulation instability. We have shown that in the focusing case the localized periodic initial modulation of the plane wave may excite both a single SRB and the second-order SRBs involving four fundamental breathers.Received 9 June 2023Revised 12 October 2023Accepted 27 November 2023DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.027201© 2024 American Physical SocietyPhysics Subject Headings (PhySH)Research AreasOptical solitonsPattern formationPhysical SystemsBreathersSolitonsNonlinear DynamicsAtomic, Molecular & Optical",2024-01-10,2024,Chong Liu; Shaochun Chen; Nail Akhmediev,Australian National University,Physical Review Letters,17,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.132.027201,Advanced_Manufacturing,Breather; Order (exchange); Physics; Classical mechanics; Quantum mechanics,0.15
W4392194220,"Visualising a framework for enhancing material circularity in building construction projects: Drivers, barriers, and strategies","Material circularity offers a novel perspective for industrial ecosystems, emphasising the reintegration of materials and products into the supply chain as valuable resources. This approach leads to a reduction in primary resource consumption and waste generation. Nevertheless, the incorporation of material circularity within the construction sector is hindered by barriers, necessitating careful analysis and practical solutions. Therefore, a clear roadmap with practical strategies that promote material circularity is needed. This study aims to identify the drivers, barriers, and strategies, concurrently formulating a framework to enhance material circularity in building construction projects. A sequential qualitative-quantitative mixed methods approach was employed to achieve this aim, which involved a literature review, 19 expert interviews, and two questionnaire surveys, which collectively yielded 230 responses. A literature review and expert interviews identified drivers, barriers, and strategies for implementing material circularity practices. Subsequently, using a five-point Likert scale, the first survey measured the importance of drivers and barriers. Then, the second survey was conducted to align strategies with corresponding barriers to enhance material circularity practices effectively. The results of the study indicated that cost savings primarily drive the adoption of material circularity. The most significant barrier was the underdeveloped marketplace for secondary products. The government plays a crucial role in addressing various barriers by implementing key strategies, including the introduction of regulations, policies, and economic incentives to promote material circularity. Finally, an evidence-based framework is proposed to assist practitioners and policymakers in creating a roadmap for implementing circular economy practices.",2024-02-26,2024,Isuri Amarasinghe; Ying Hong; Rodney A.

W4396656821,Systematic challenges and opportunities in insect monitoring: a Global South perspective,"Insect monitoring is pivotal for assessing biodiversity and informing conservation strategies. This study delves into the complex realm of insect monitoring in the Global South-world developing and least-developed countries as identified by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development-highlighting challenges and proposing strategic solutions. An analysis of publications from 1990 to 2024 reveals an imbalance in research contributions between the Global North and South, highlighting disparities in entomological research and the scarcity of taxonomic expertise in the Global South. We discuss the socio-economic factors that exacerbate the issues, including funding disparities, challenges in collaboration, infrastructure deficits, information technology obstacles and the impact of local currency devaluation. In addition, we emphasize the crucial role of environmental factors in shaping insect diversity, particularly in tropical regions facing multiple challenges including climate change, urbanization, pollution and various anthropogenic activities. We also stress the need for entomologists to advocate for ecosystem services provided by insects in addressing environmental issues. To enhance monitoring capacity, we propose strategies such as community engagement, outreach programmes and cultural activities to instill biodiversity appreciation. Further, language inclusivity and social media use are emphasized for effective communication. More collaborations with Global North counterparts, particularly in areas of molecular biology and remote sensing, are suggested for technological advancements. In conclusion, advocating for these strategies-global collaborations, a diverse entomological community and the integration of transverse disciplines-aims to address challenges and foster inclusive, sustainable insect monitoring in the Global South, contributing significantly to biodiversity conservation and overall ecosystem health.

W4399492837,Localized wave structures: Solitons and beyond,"The review is concerned with solitary waves and other localized structures in the systems described by a variety of generalizations of the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation. Among the topics we focus upon are “radiating solitons,” the generic structures made of soliton-like pulses, and oscillating tails. We also review the properties of solitary waves in the generalized KdV equations with the modular and “sublinear” nonlinearities. Such equations have an interesting class of solutions, called compactons, solitary waves defined on a finite spatial interval. Both the properties of single solitons and the interactions between them are discussed. We show that even minor non-elastic effects in the soliton–soliton collisions can accumulate and result in a qualitatively different asymptotic behavior. A statistical description of soliton ensembles (“soliton gas”), which emerges as a major theme, has been discussed for several models. We briefly outline the recent progress in studies of ring solitons and lumps within the framework of the cylindrical KdV equation and its two-dimensional extension. Ring solitons and lumps (2D solitons) are of particular interest since they have many features in common with classical solitons and yet are qualitatively different. Particular attention is paid to interactions between the objects of different geometries, such as the interaction of ring solitons and shear flows, ring solitons and lumps, and lumps and line solitons. We conclude our review with views of the future developments of the selected lines of studies of localized wave structures in the theory of weakly nonlinear, weakly dispersive waves.",2024-06-01,2024,Lev A.

W4366495289,Nonlinear topological symmetry protection in a dissipative system,"Abstract We investigate experimentally and theoretically a system ruled by an intricate interplay between topology, nonlinearity, and spontaneous symmetry breaking. The experiment is based on a two-mode coherently-driven optical resonator where photons interact through the Kerr nonlinearity. In presence of a phase defect, the modal structure acquires a synthetic Möbius topology enabling the realization of spontaneous symmetry breaking in inherently bias-free conditions without fine tuning of parameters. Rigorous statistical tests confirm the robustness of the underlying symmetry protection, which manifests itself by a periodic alternation of the modes reminiscent of period-doubling. This dynamic also confers long term stability to various localized structures including domain walls, solitons, and breathers. Our findings are supported by an effective Hamiltonian model and have relevance to other systems of interacting bosons and to the Floquet engineering of quantum matter. They could also be beneficial to the implementation of coherent Ising machines.",2024-02-15,2024,Stéphane Coen; Bruno Garbin; Gang Xu; Liam Quinn; Nathan Goldman,University of Auckland,Nature Communications,16,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-44640-x,Advanced_Manufacturing,Physics; Symmetry breaking; Topology (electrical circuits); Spontaneous symmetry breaking; Dissipative system,0.225
W4391050280,Numerical study on perforation damage and fragmentation of reinforced concrete slab under close-in explosion,"Reinforced concrete (RC) structure is prone to suffer localized damage when exposed to close-in explosions. Spalling damage might occur due to the reflected tensile stress wave exceeding the concrete dynamic tensile strength. When the blast wave is intensive enough, it can also cause significant crushing damage on the contact surface, potentially leading to perforation when the crushing depth aligns with the spalling depth. This perforation/spalling damage can generate a large number of secondary fragments with high ejecting velocities. Additionally, the blast wave might pass through the perforation hole and cause further acceleration of the secondary fragments. In the author's previous study, an ALE-FEM-SPH numerical model was established and validated with the existing testing data for the prediction of spalling damage as well as fragment sizes and velocities. As a continuous work, this study conducts numerical simulations to predict the perforation damage and fragmentation under higher-intensity blast loading. The results including centre perforation hole, spalling area on back surface, fragment ejecting velocities, fragment landing distance and fragment characteristics distributions are reported and studied. The acceleration effect on the secondary fragments by the traversed blast wave that further carries the fragments flying is also investigated. The numerical results show that using the scaled distance Z might not reliably quantify the perforation/spalling damage under close-in cylindrical TNT explosion. Given the identical scaled distance, the scenarios with different combinations of charge weight and standoff distance can result in large variations up to 300% in the predictions of damaged area and 50% for the maximum fragment ejecting velocities, respectively. A scaled blast parameter Z* is suggested and the empirical formulae are proposed for better quantification of the damaged area of RC slab as well as the fragment velocity and kinetic energy under close-in cylindrical TNT explosions.",2024-01-20,2024,Zitong Wang; Wensu Chen; Zhijie Huang; Hong Hao,Curtin University,Engineering Failure Analysis,16,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engfailanal.2024.107985,Advanced_Manufacturing,Spall; Perforation; Ultimate tensile strength; Fragmentation (computing); Structural engineering,0.15
W4392343685,Dynamic pricing in consumer-centric electricity markets: A systematic review and thematic analysis,"Tariff reforms in electricity markets is becoming an area of active evaluation as efforts intensify to decarbonize electricity generation, stabilize the power grid, and maximize the welfare of electricity producers and consumers. Peaks in load profiles occur when demand is not regulated, requiring huge capacity additions, which are not utilized during off-peak periods thus undermining system efficiency. With dynamic pricing of electricity, opportunities can arise to shift demand from peak to off-peak periods and this can help to reduce the need for huge capacity additions. This paper conducts a systematic review of dynamic electricity pricing literature in order to understand the evolution of research in this growing field. 218 relevant journal papers published between 1949 and 2020 are identified from which thematic maps and ontological tables are drawn to understand key subject areas that have emerged over the years and their interlinkages. Six major thematic areas of dynamic electricity pricing research are reported including 1) pricing scheme and modeling, 2) pricing impacts, 3) user demand response, 4) consumption scheduling, 5) load scheduling technologies, and 6) cybersecurity threats and fairness issues. These six major thematic areas are then broken down into twenty second-order themes and fifty eight first-order themes. The review provides an overview of the development of the field while providing insights on its future development. It concludes that, despite coherent themes, the research on dynamic electricity pricing has enormous potential for follow-up work and theory development.",2024-03-01,2024,Chin Hui Hao; Presley K.

W4390545889,Taking steps toward healthy &amp; sustainable transport investment: A systematic review of economic evaluations in the academic literature on large-scale active transport infrastructure,"For cities seeking to promote active transport, overcoming the institutional practices of car-centric planning and investment is critical to redistributing funds toward dedicated walking and cycling infrastructure. Slowly, urban policy and research are expanding traditional mobility-centric economic evaluations beyond major road and rail projects. This review paper of the academic literature employs a systematic quantitative literature review (SQLR) methodology and contributes an up-to-date examination of academic economic evaluations undertaken on large-scale active transport infrastructure implementations (i.e. capital costs greater than USD$3 million as of 2022). Seventeen (17) peer-reviewed academic papers were included in the final analysis. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA), followed by cost-effective analysis (CEA) and health impact assessment (HIA), were the most common pre-implementation (ex ante) and post-implementation (ex post) assessment methods. Between implementation-types, contexts, and methodologies, the parameters factored in econometric evaluations present a large degree of variance. Despite this, all studies demonstrated the positive return on investment in large-scale active transport infrastructure, where all CBAs produced benefit-cost ratios greater than the breakeven threshold (i.e. >1). Results show health parameters contribute the greatest benefit to positive evaluations, accounting for 77% of total benefits (and 67% in the CBA papers). However, evaluations inconsistently factor or omit long-term, intergenerational, and non-mobility benefits that highlight a partiality in their approach and can be co-opted to support predetermined outcomes. Further research must seek to establish if more expansive, sustainability-orientated methods are needed, or whether to adopt policy positions acknowledging the positive returns walking and cycling infrastructure deliver.",2024-01-03,2024,Madison Bland; Matthew Burke; Kelly Bertolaccini,Griffith University,International Journal of Sustainable Transportation,15,https://doi.org/10.1080/15568318.2023.2296952,Advanced_Manufacturing,Sustainable transport; Investment (military); Scale (ratio); Return on investment; Sustainability,0.508

This review aims to systematically assess the state of the art in ABM-based evacuation modelling with respect to methodologies, validation practices, and the associated challenges over the past decade. The review critically examines 134 studies from 2013 to 2023 that have applied ABMs for pedestrian evacuation simulation to synthesise current capabilities, limitations, and advancement pathways. Findings identify persistent challenges related to modeller bias, computational complexity, data scarcity for calibration and validation, and the predominance of simplistic rule-based decision-making models, while promise exists with the adoption of flexible behavioural frameworks, high-performance computing architectures, machine learning techniques for adaptive agent behaviours and surrogate modelling, and evolutionary computation methods for transparent rule generation. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration among behavioural scientists, modellers, and emergency planners to enhance the realism and reliability of ABMs. By providing a critical synthesis of the state-of-the-art and proposing future research directions, this review aims to accelerate the development and application of ABMs that can meaningfully enhance the safety and resilience of communities facing emergencies.",2024-08-02,2024,G.

W2972236099,An Isolated Complex V Inefficiency and Dysregulated Mitochondrial Function in Immortalized Lymphocytes from ME/CFS Patients,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is an enigmatic condition characterized by exacerbation of symptoms after exertion (post-exertional malaise or ""PEM""), and by fatigue whose severity and associated requirement for rest are excessive and disproportionate to the fatigue-inducing activity. There is no definitive molecular marker or known underlying pathological mechanism for the condition. Increasing evidence for aberrant energy metabolism suggests a role for mitochondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS. Our objective was therefore to measure mitochondrial function and cellular stress sensing in actively metabolizing patient blood cells. We immortalized lymphoblasts isolated from 51 ME/CFS patients diagnosed according to the Canadian Consensus Criteria and an age- and gender-matched control group. Parameters of mitochondrial function and energy stress sensing were assessed by Seahorse extracellular flux analysis, proteomics, and an array of additional biochemical assays. As a proportion of the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), the rate of ATP synthesis by Complex V was significantly reduced in ME/CFS lymphoblasts, while significant elevations were observed in Complex I OCR, maximum OCR, spare respiratory capacity, nonmitochondrial OCR and ""proton leak"" as a proportion of the basal OCR. This was accompanied by a reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, chronically hyperactivated TOR Complex I stress signaling and upregulated expression of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, fatty acid transporters, and enzymes of the β-oxidation and TCA cycles. By contrast, mitochondrial mass and genome copy number, as well as glycolytic rates and steady state ATP levels were unchanged. Our results suggest a model in which ME/CFS lymphoblasts have a Complex V defect accompanied by compensatory upregulation of their respiratory capacity that includes the mitochondrial respiratory complexes, membrane transporters and enzymes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation. This homeostatically returns ATP synthesis and steady state levels to ""normal"" in the resting cells, but may leave them unable to adequately respond to acute increases in energy demand as the relevant homeostatic pathways are already activated.",2020-02-06,2020,Daniel Missailidis; Sarah J.

W3088286182,Multiagent Actor-Critic Network-Based Incentive Mechanism for Mobile Crowdsensing in Industrial Systems,"Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is an appealing sensing paradigm that leverages the sensing capabilities of smart devices and the inherent mobility of device owners to accomplish sensing tasks with the aim of constructing powerful industrial systems. Incentivizing mobile users (MUs) to participate in sensing activities and contribute high-quality data is of paramount importance to the success of MCS services. In this article, we formulate the competitive interactions between a sensing platform (SP) and MUs as a multistage Stackelberg game with the SP as the leader player and the MUs as the followers. Given the unit prices announced by MUs, the SP calculates the quantity of sensing time to purchase from each MU by solving a convex optimization problem. Then, each follower observes the trading records and iteratively adjusts their pricing strategy in a trial-and-error manner based on a multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.",2020-09-21,2020,Bo Gu; Xinxin Yang; Ziqi Lin; Weiwei Hu; Mamoun Alazab,Charles Darwin University,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,73,https://doi.org/10.1109/tii.2020.3024611,Advanced_Manufacturing,Crowdsensing; Stackelberg competition; Computer science; Incentive; Mobile device,0.15

We examine Chile, which represents a vibrant economy and one of the world's most productive entrepreneurship ecosystems but with a history of socio‐economic inequalities and strong profit‐driven pressures to overextract natural resources. The study is based on a questionnaire related to manufacturing sent to 112 companies in Chile. The proposed relationships are analysed through structural equation modelling.

W3044658422,Farm machinery use and maize yields in China: an analysis accounting for selection bias and heterogeneity,"Crop production in developing and emerging countries is increasingly dependent on the usage of farm machinery. However, it remains unclear whether low‐productive and high‐productive farmers benefit equally from farm machinery use. To address the research gap, this study examines the potential heterogeneous effects of farm machinery use on maize yields, using an unconditional quantile regression model and survey data from China. We employ a control function approach to address the selection bias issue associated with farm machinery use. The empirical results show that the use of farm machinery significant increases maize yields for all the selected quantiles (except for the 80th quantile); the low‐productive farmers tend to benefit more from farm machinery use relative to their high‐productive counterparts; and farm machinery use reduces the inequality and variability of maize yields.",2020-07-24,2020,Xiaoshi Zhou; Wanglin Ma; Gucheng Li; Huanguang Qiu,Lincoln University,Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics,71,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.12395,Advanced_Manufacturing,Production (economics); Quantile regression; Quantile; Selection (genetic algorithm); Selection bias,0.283
W3113346630,An Adaptive PV Frequency Control Strategy Based on Real-Time Inertia Estimation,"The declining cost of solar Photovoltaics (PV) generation is driving its worldwide deployment. As conventional generation with large rotating masses is being replaced by renewable energy such as PV, the power system's inertia will be affected. As a result, the system's frequency may vary more dramatically in the case of a disturbance, and the frequency nadir may be low enough to trigger protection relays such as under-frequency load shedding. The existing frequency-watt function mandated in power inverters cannot provide grid frequency support in a loss-of-generation event, as PV plants usually do not have power reserves. In this article, a novel adaptive PV frequency control strategy is proposed to reserve the minimum power required for grid frequency support. A machine learning model is trained to predict system frequency response under varying system conditions, and an adaptive allocation of PV headroom reserves is made based on the machine learning model as well as real-time system conditions including inertia. Case studies show the proposed control method meets the frequency nadir requirements using minimal power reserves compared to a fixed headroom control approach.",2020-12-17,2020,Yu Su; Hongyu Li; Yi Cui; Shutang You; Yiwei Ma,Queensland University of Technology,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,69,https://doi.org/10.1109/tsg.2020.3045626,Advanced_Manufacturing,Automatic frequency control; Photovoltaic system; Electric power system; Control theory (sociology); Automatic Generation Control,0.3

We define such systems collaborative, creative AI systems, and in this article, consider the theoretical and practical considerations needed for their design so as to support improvisation, performance and co-creation through real-time, sustained, moment-to-moment interaction. We begin by providing an overview of creative AI systems, examining strengths, opportunities and criticisms in order to draw out the key considerations when designing AI for human creative collaboration. We argue that the artistic goals and creative process should be first and foremost in any design. We then draw from a range of research that looks at human collaboration and teamwork, to examine features that support trust, cooperation, shared awareness and a shared information space. We highlight the importance of understanding the scope and perception of two-way communication between human and machine agents in order to support reflection on conflict, error, evaluation and flow. We conclude with a summary of the range of design challenges for building such systems in provoking, challenging and enhancing human creative activity through their creative agency.",2020-03-04,2020,Jon McCormack; Patrick Hutchings; Toby Gifford; Matthew Yee-King; Maria Teresa Llano,Monash University,Organised Sound,66,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1355771819000451,Advanced_Manufacturing,Improvisation; Computer science; Teamwork; Process (computing); Scope (computer science),0.358
W3037789473,Global Macroeconomic Scenarios of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 global pandemic has caused significant global economic and social disruption. In McKibbin and Fernando (2020), we used data from historical pandemics to explore seven plausible scenarios of the economic consequences if COVID-19 were to become a global pandemic. In this paper, we use currently observed epidemiological outcomes across countries and recent data on sectoral shutdowns and economic shocks to estimate the likely impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy in coming years under six new scenarios. The first scenario explores the outcomes if the current course of COVID-19 is successfully controlled, and there is only a mild recurrence in 2021. We then explore scenarios where the opening of economies results in recurrent outbreaks of various magnitudes and countries respond with and without economic shutdowns. We also explore the impact if no vaccine becomes available and the world must adapt to living with COVID-19 in coming decades. The final scenario is the case where a given country is in the most optimistic scenario (scenario 1), but the rest of the world is in the most pessimistic scenario.The scenarios in this paper demonstrate that even a contained outbreak (which is optimistic), will significantly impact the global economy in the coming years.

W3040329870,GRVMP: A Greedy Randomized Algorithm for Virtual Machine Placement in Cloud Data Centers,"Cloud computing efficiency greatly depends on the efficiency of the virtual machines (VMs) placement strategy used. However, VM placement has remained one of the major challenging issues in cloud computing mainly because of the heterogeneity in both virtual and physical machines (PMs), the multidimensionality of the resources, and the increasing scale of the cloud data centers (CDCs). An inefficiency in VM placement strategy has a significant influence on the quality of service provided, the amount of energy consumed, and the running costs of the CDCs. To address these issues, in this article, we propose a greedy randomized VM placement (GRVMP) algorithm in a large-scale CDC with heterogeneous and multidimensional resources. GRVMP inspires the ""power of two choices"" model and places VMs on the more power-efficient PMs to jointly optimize CDC energy usage and resource utilization. The performance of GRVMP is evaluated using synthetic and real-world production scenarios (Amazon EC2) with several performance matrices. The results of the experiment confirm that GRVMP jointly optimizes power usage and the overall wastage of resource utilization. The results also show that GRVMP significantly outperforms the baseline schemes in terms of the performance metrics used.",2020-06-30,2020,Sadoon Azizi; Mohammad Shojafar; Jemal Abawajy; Rajkumar Buyya,Deakin University,IEEE Systems Journal,66,https://doi.org/10.1109/jsyst.2020.3002721,Advanced_Manufacturing,Cloud computing; Computer science; Virtual machine; Inefficiency; Distributed computing,0.358

W3043022390,An Online Reinforcement Learning Approach for Dynamic Pricing of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations,"The global market share of electric vehicles (EVs) is on the rise, resulting in a rapid increase in their charging demand in both spatial and temporal domains. A remedy to shift the extra charging loads at peak hours to off-peak hours, caused by charging EVs at public charging stations, is an online pricing strategy. This paper presents a novel combinatorial online pricing strategy that has been established upon a reward-based model to prevent network instability and power outages. In the proposed solution, the utility provides incentives to the charging stations for their contributions in the EVs charging load shifting. Then, a constraint optimization problem is developed to minimize the total charging demand of the EVs during peak hours. To control the EVs charging demands in supporting utility's stability and increasing the total revenue of the charging stations, treated as a multi-agent framework, an online reinforcement learning model is developed which is based on the combination of an adaptive heuristic critic and recursive least square algorithm. The effective performance of the proposed model is validated through extensive simulation studies such as qualitative, numerical, and robustness performance assessment tests. The simulation results indicate significant improvement in the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of utility's power saving and charging stations' profit.",2020-01-01,2020,Valeh Moghaddam; Amirmehdi Yazdani; Hai Wang; David Parlevliet; Farhad Shahnia,Deakin University,IEEE Access,62,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.3009419,Advanced_Manufacturing,Reinforcement learning; Dynamic pricing; Computer science; Robustness (evolution); Revenue,0.15
W3215126457,Impacts of cooperative membership on banana yield and risk exposure: Insights from China,"Abstract The yield‐increasing effects of agricultural cooperative membership have been widely examined in the literature. However, so far, little is known about whether cooperative membership has the potential to reduce farmers’ exposure to production risk. We address this gap by estimating the impacts of cooperative membership on expected yield, yield variance (variability), and yield skewness (exposure to downside risk), using data collected from a survey of 626 banana farmers in China. We employ an endogenous switching regression model to address the selectivity bias issue. The empirical results show that cooperative membership increases banana yield by 3% and reduces the variance and downside risk exposure by 60% and 114%, respectively. The results are supported by robustness check estimates, using propensity score matching and inverse probability weighted regression adjustment models. Additional analysis reveals that the treatment effects of cooperative membership vary among members with different household and farm characteristics. Our findings suggest that agricultural cooperatives can be an effective institutional arrangement for reducing production risk and crop failure and point to the need for policies and programmes in developing cooperatives and increasing membership involvements of smallholder farmers.",2021-11-24,2021,Wanglin Ma; Hongyun Zheng; Peng Yuan,Lincoln University,Journal of Agricultural Economics,60,https://doi.org/10.1111/1477-9552.12465,Advanced_Manufacturing,Downside risk; Propensity score matching; Econometrics; Yield (engineering); Agriculture,0.208
W3004304303,A Short Survey of Pre-trained Language Models for Conversational AI-A New Age in NLP,"Building a dialogue system that can communicate naturally with humans is a challenging yet interesting problem of agent-based computing. The rapid growth in this area is usually hindered by the long-standing problem of data scarcity as these systems are expected to learn syntax, grammar, decision making, and reasoning from insufficient amounts of task-specific dataset. The recently introduced pre-trained language models have the potential to address the issue of data scarcity and bring considerable advantages by generating contextualized word embeddings. These models are considered counterpart of ImageNet in NLP and have demonstrated to capture different facets of language such as hierarchical relations, long-term dependency, and sentiment. In this short survey paper, we discuss the recent progress made in the field of pre-trained language models. We also deliberate that how the strengths of these language models can be leveraged in designing more engaging and more eloquent conversational agents. This paper, therefore, intends to establish whether these pre-trained models can overcome the challenges pertinent to dialogue systems, and how their architecture could be exploited in order to overcome these challenges. Open challenges in the field of dialogue systems have also been deliberated.",2020-01-30,2020,Munazza Zaib; Quan Z.

Governments around the globe are not in a consensus position on the most appropriate response to the pandemic. This study utilizes an economic model to assess choices and compare outcome of public health policies using China as a case study. A lax policy could have costed the country up to 97% of inbound tourism revenue; reduced real gross domestic product by 11% and decreased employment by 15%. Analysis shows that the appropriate prevention and control policy of the Chinese Government have mitigated the impact of COVID-19 significantly for both tourism and non-tourism sectors. Importantly, the article highlights that the substantial negative impact on investment in tourism will slow down the sector’s recovery.

W3083240677,Development and Validation of Artificial Neural Network-Based Tools for Forecasting of Power System Inertia With Wind Farms Penetration,"Increased penetration of power electronics interfaced renewable energy sources-based generation, for instance, wind farms, that displaces much of the conventional synchronous generation, has a profound effect on the inertia of modern/future power system networks. This article presents the development and validation of artificial neural network (ANN)-based tools, utilizing the power system variables measured by phasor measurement units through wide-area measurements systems, for estimation/forecasting of power system inertia with high penetration of wind farms. The development stage involves the correlation analysis to identify the best power system variables that can be nominated as inputs, and the training of the proposed inertia forecasting tools with the best-nominated inputs that are highly correlated with the power system inertia. Whereas, in the validation stage, the functionality of the trained ANN-based inertia forecasting tools have been validated using the hardware-in-the-loop testing facility developed at the University of Manchester. The development and validation procedures of the proposed inertia forecasting tools have been demonstrated on the IEEE 9-bus modified test system. The validation results revealed the effectiveness of the proposed inertia forecasting tools in estimating the inertia of modern/future power system networks with high penetration of wind farms.",2020-09-02,2020,E.S.N.

We employ an innovative two‐stage predictor substitution model combined with an unconditional quantile regression model to address the endogeneity of the cooperative membership variable and analyze data collected from 626 banana farmers in China. Results, in general, show that cooperative membership improves banana farm financial performance. Particularly, we show that cooperative membership affects net returns and ROI positively and significantly across the selected unconditional quantiles, with the highest impact occurring at the highest 80th quantile. Cooperative membership also has a positive and significant impact on the profit margin for all quantiles (except for the 20th quantile), but the larger impacts occurring at the lower quantiles.",2021-04-21,2021,Wanglin Ma; Hongyun Zheng; Yueji Zhu; Jianling Qi,Lincoln University,Annals of public and co-operative economy,58,https://doi.org/10.1111/apce.12326,Advanced_Manufacturing,Quantile; Endogeneity; Quantile regression; Econometrics; Economics,0.15
W3007899872,Workplace digitalisation and work-nonwork satisfaction: the role of spillover social media,"Prior research has shown that the use of Information Communication Technology (ICT) outside work hours blurs work and nonwork boundaries, exacerbates work-life conflict, and negatively impacts employees' satisfaction. Conversely, personal ICT-use at work, or cyberloafing, has become an increasing concern among employers given its putative impact on individual and organisational performance. We use the 'dual-lens' of Boundary theory and Set theory to conceptualise employees' work-related ICT-use outside work hours and cyberloafing as a set-theoretic phenomenon reflecting 'spillover social media'. Drawing on a survey of 403 Australian white-collar employees and using a set-theoretic approach (fsQCA), we discuss the following findings. First, spillover social media positively impacts work satisfaction among people who are single and do not have children. Second, spillover social media positively contributes to nonwork satisfaction among married male participants who do not have children. Third, that parents only reported nonwork satisfaction if they did not engage in spillover social media.",2020-02-17,2020,Farveh Farivar; Julia Richardson,University of Tasmania,Behaviour and Information Technology,57,https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929x.2020.1723702,Advanced_Manufacturing,Spillover effect; Social media; Information and Communications Technology; Social psychology; Psychology,0.45
W3114244868,Federated Learning Meets Contract Theory: Economic-Efficiency Framework for Electric Vehicle Networks,"In this paper, we propose a novel economic-efficiency framework for an electric vehicle (EV) network to maximize the profits (i.e., the amount of money that can be earned) for charging stations (CSs). To that end, we first introduce an energy demand prediction method for CSs leveraging federated learning approaches, in which each CS can train its own energy transactions locally and exchange its learned model with other CSs to improve the learning quality while protecting the CS's information privacy. Based on the predicted energy demands, each CS can reserve energy from the smart grid provider (SGP) in advance to optimize its profit. Nonetheless, due to the competition among the CSs as well as unknown information from the SGP, i.e., the willingness to transfer energy, we develop a multi-principal one-agent (MPOA) contract-based method to address these issues. In particular, we formulate the CSs' profit maximization as a non-collaborative energy contract problem under the SGP's unknown information and common constraints as well as other CSs' contracts. To solve this problem, we transform it into an equivalent low-complexity optimization problem and develop an iterative algorithm to find the optimal contracts for the CSs. Through simulation results using a real CS dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed framework can enhance energy demand prediction accuracy up to 24.63 percent compared with other machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, our proposed framework can outperform other economic models by 48 and 36 percent in terms of the CSs' utilities and social welfare (i.e., the total profits of all participating entities) of the network, respectively.",2020-12-21,2020,Yuris Mulya Saputra; Diep N.

W3000548357,Climate Change Adaptation Options for Coastal Communities and Local Governments,"Extreme weather events and failure to adapt to the likely impacts of climate change are two of the most significant threats to humanity. Therefore, many local communities are preparing adaptation plans. Even so, much of what was done has not been published in the peer-reviewed literature. This means that consideration of adaptation options for local communities is limited. With the objective of assisting in the development of adaptation plans, we present 80 adaptation options suitable for coastal communities that can be applied by local governments. They are a catena of options from defend to co-exist and finally, retreat that progresses as impacts become less manageable. Options are organized according to their capacity to protect local properties and infrastructure, natural systems, food production, availability of fresh and drinking water and well-being of the local population, as these are likely to be affected by climate change. To respond to multiple threats, ‘soft’ options, such as awareness raising, planning, political articulation and financial incentives, insurance and professional skills enhancement, can be encouraged immediately at relatively low cost and are reversible. For specific threats, options emphasize change in management practices as pre-emptive measures. Key audiences for this work are communities and local governments starting to consider priority actions to respond to climate change impacts.",2020-01-07,2020,Laura Sinay; Bill Carter,University of the Sunshine Coast,Climate,56,https://doi.org/10.3390/cli8010007,Advanced_Manufacturing,Climate change; Environmental resource management; Business; Work (physics); Environmental planning,0.283
W3119642420,Waves that Appear From Nowhere: Complex Rogue Wave Structures and Their Elementary Particles,"The nonlinear Schrödinger equation has wide range of applications in physics with spatial scales that vary from microns to kilometres. Consequently, its solutions are also universal and can be applied to water waves, optics, plasma and Bose-Einstein condensate. The most remarkable solution presently known as the Peregrine solution describes waves that appear from nowhere. This solution describes unique events localized both in time and in space. Following the language of mariners they are called “rogue waves”. As thorough mathematical analysis shows, these waves have properties that differ them from any other nonlinear waves known before. Peregrine waves can serve as ‘elementary particles’ in more complex structures that are also exact solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. These structures lead to specific patterns with various degrees of symmetry. Some of them resemble “atomic like structures”. The number of particles in these structures is not arbitrary but satisfies strict rules. Similar structures may be observed in systems described by other equations of mathematical physics: Hirota equation, Davey-Stewartson equations, Sasa-Satsuma equation, generalized Landau-Lifshitz equation, complex KdV equation and even the coupled Higgs field equations describing nucleons interacting with neutral scalar mesons. This means that the ideas of rogue waves enter nearly all areas of physics including the field of elementary particles.",2021-01-15,2021,Nail Akhmediev,Australian National University,Frontiers in Physics,56,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2020.612318,Advanced_Manufacturing,Rogue wave; Physics; Scalar field; Korteweg–de Vries equation; Nonlinear Schrödinger equation,0.3
W3035111702,GAN-Driven Personalized Spatial-Temporal Private Data Sharing in Cyber-Physical Social Systems,"The cyber-physical social system (CPSS) enables human social interaction from cyberspace to the physical world by sharing an increasing volume of spatial-temporal data. The sensitive information in the shared data is appealing to the adversaries and various attacks. However, most existing research assumes that the privacy protection level is identical regardless of various requirements, which is not practical. Subsequently, this results in either over-protection or failing to resist the leading attacks like collusion attacks. Motivated by this, a personalized model is proposed by using generative adversarial nets (GAN) to achieve differential privacy and thereby enhancing spatial-temporal private data sharing. A Differential Privacy Identifier is added to the classic GAN with a Generator and a Discriminator. The deployment of the differentially Private GAN (P-GAN) enables the generation of the sanitized data that can perfectly approximate the spatial-temporal trajectory while providing high-level privacy protection. P-GAN optimizes the trade-off between personalized privacy protection and improved data utility while maintaining fast convergence. Simultaneously, the random noise generation guaranteed by GAN breaks the correlation of injected noises and make P-GAN attack-proof against the collusion attacks. Extensive evaluation results on real-world datasets show the superiority of P-GAN from the aspects of optimized trade-off and efficiency.",2020-06-09,2020,Youyang Qu; Shui Yu; Wanlei Zhou; Yonghong Tian,Deakin University,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,55,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnse.2020.3001061,Advanced_Manufacturing,Differential privacy; Computer science; Collusion; Information privacy; Data sharing,0.225
W3088276292,A Framework for Joint Scheduling and Power Trading of Prosumers in Transactive Markets,"The emergence of prosumers, as new players in the distribution networks, provides the opportunity to manage distributed energy resources (DERs) at a local level. However, designing an appropriate framework that empowers prosumers to manage their resources and trade energy with each other is a challenging task. This paper proposes a framework for joint scheduling and power trading of a community of prosumers in a transactive energy market (TEM). Prosumers perform day-ahead energy management to schedule their flexible energy resources to reduce their energy expenses. In the scheduling step, each prosumer indicates the expected surplus/deficit energy, which needs to be traded in different markets as well as the flexibility which can be provided in response to grid operator's requests. Then, in intra-day markets, prosumers can trade energy with either their neighbors in a peer-to-peer (P2P) market or the grid. Also, prosumers can participate in an event-driven flexibility market to respond to the requested flexibility by the grid operator. A distributed price-directed market clearing mechanism is presented, which ensures the privacy of prosumers and the market scalability. Simulation results show that energy trading in the community reduces prosumers energy costs, while the grid operator can utilize prosumers' flexibility for managing grid constraints.",2020-09-24,2020,Mohsen Khorasany; Afshin Najafi-Ghalelou; Reza Razzaghi,Monash University,IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy,55,https://doi.org/10.1109/tste.2020.3026611,Advanced_Manufacturing,Prosumer; Computer science; Distributed generation; Energy market; Demand response,0.225
W3118104792,Adoption of organic soil amendments and its impact on farm performance: evidence from wheat farmers in China*,"This study examines the determinants of adoption of organic soil amendments (OSAs) such as organic fertiliser and farmyard manure and its impact on crop yields and net returns, using household survey data of 558 wheat farmers in China. We employ an endogenous switching regression model to account for selection bias stemming from both observable and unobservable factors. The empirical results show that household size, dependency ratio, machine ownership and non‐paid labour are main factors that determine farmers’ decision to adopt OSA, and the OSA adoption has a positive and statistically significant impact on wheat yields and net returns. In particular, the treatment effects of OSA adoption are to increase wheat yields and net returns by appropriately 22 and 24 per cent, respectively. Moreover, disaggregated analysis by farm size reveals that large‐scale households tend to obtain higher wheat yields and net returns than their small‐scale counterparts.",2020-12-27,2020,Hongyun Zheng; Wanglin Ma; Gucheng Li,Lincoln University,Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics,55,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.12406,Advanced_Manufacturing,Unobservable; China; Scale (ratio); Agricultural economics; Economics,0.15
W3163667991,Evaluating cost function criteria in predicting healthy gait,"Accurate predictive simulations of human gait rely on optimisation criteria to solve the system’s redundancy. Defining such criteria is challenging, as the objectives driving the optimization of human gait are unclear. This study evaluated how minimising various physiologically-based criteria (i.e., cost of transport, muscle activity, head stability, foot–ground impact, and knee ligament use) affects the predicted gait, and developed and evaluated a combined, weighted cost function tuned to predict healthy gait. A generic planar musculoskeletal model with 18 Hill-type muscles was actuated using a reflex-based, parameterized controller. First, the criteria were applied into the base simulation framework separately. The gait pattern predicted by minimising each criterion was compared to experimental data of healthy gait using coefficients of determination (R2) and root mean square errors (RMSE) averaged over all biomechanical variables. Second, the optimal weighted combined cost function was created through stepwise addition of the criteria. Third, performance of the resulting combined cost function was evaluated by comparing the predicted gait to a simulation that was optimised solely to track experimental data. Optimising for each of the criteria separately showed their individual contribution to distinct aspects of gait (overall R2: 0.37–0.56; RMSE: 3.47–4.63 SD). An optimally weighted combined cost function provided improved overall agreement with experimental data (overall R2: 0.72; RMSE: 2.10 SD), and its performance was close to what is maximally achievable for the underlying simulation framework. This study showed how various optimisation criteria contribute to synthesising gait and that careful weighting of them is essential in predicting healthy gait.",2021-05-18,2021,Kirsten Veerkamp; Niels Waterval; Thomas Geijtenbeek; Christopher P.

W3160260334,Blockchain-Enabled Asynchronous Federated Learning in Edge Computing,"The fast proliferation of edge computing devices brings an increasing growth of data, which directly promotes machine learning (ML) technology development. However, privacy issues during data collection for ML tasks raise extensive concerns. To solve this issue, synchronous federated learning (FL) is proposed, which enables the central servers and end devices to maintain the same ML models by only exchanging model parameters. However, the diversity of computing power and data sizes leads to a significant difference in local training data consumption, and thereby causes the inefficiency of FL. Besides, the centralized processing of FL is vulnerable to single-point failure and poisoning attacks. Motivated by this, we propose an innovative method, federated learning with asynchronous convergence (FedAC) considering a staleness coefficient, while using a blockchain network instead of the classic central server to aggregate the global model. It avoids real-world issues such as interruption by abnormal local device training failure, dedicated attacks, etc. By comparing with the baseline models, we implement the proposed method on a real-world dataset, MNIST, and achieve accuracy rates of 98.96% and 95.84% in both horizontal and vertical FL modes, respectively. Extensive evaluation results show that FedAC outperforms most existing models.",2021-05-11,2021,Yinghui Liu; Youyang Qu; Chenhao Xu; Zhicheng Hao; Bruce Gu,Deakin University,Sensors,53,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21103335,Advanced_Manufacturing,Computer science; MNIST database; Asynchronous communication; Server; Inefficiency,0.15
W3201331455,A recovery planning model for online business operations under the COVID-19 outbreak,"This study analytically develops a new recovery planning optimisation model for managing the impacts of the recent COVID-19 outbreak for online business operations. Firstly, a mathematical model for the ideal plan is designed and then extended to generate a recovery plan in a finite planning horizon that maximises total profit. Recovery plans are generated considering two scenarios, namely the dynamic and uncertain situations. For the dynamic situation, a realistic system with time-dependent and dynamic demand, supply, and warehouse capacity for investigating the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak is developed using several measures, such as collaborating with emergency suppliers, increasing warehouse capacity, and considering back-orders and lost sales to form recovery strategies. For the uncertain situation, demand, supply, and warehouse capacities are considered as uncertain variables. Further, an innovative solution approach using an adapted differential evolution technique, which is capable of (i) generating long-term recovery plans and (ii) solving both small- and large-scale problems, is developed. The results are illustrated using numerical analyses and simulation experiments. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted. In practice, the proposed optimisation model will assist the decision-makers of online business operations facing the COVID-19 outbreak to decide the optimal recovery plans.",2021-09-17,2021,Sanjoy Kumar Paul; Md.

W3195882766,DfMA: Towards an Integrated Strategy for a More Productive and Sustainable Construction Industry in Australia,"Design for manufacture and assembly (DfMA) is an important part of the future of the construction industry due to the promise of speed of project delivery, quality control, worker safety, and waste minimization onsite via the purposeful design for manufacture and assembly offsite. However, the adoption of DfMA in Australia has been slow. This paper investigates the barriers prohibiting widespread uptake and how digital construction will be a catalyst for improving use on commercial-scale projects. A total of six leading experts were interviewed to elicit their opinions, and seven recent case studies of high-rise modular apartment and hotel buildings constructed by Hickory were cross-referenced as evidence of DfMA capability. The experts suggested that the reasons for slow adoption in Australia were community mindset, government regulations and incentives, planning and building codes, unionization and business politics, finance, and supply chain management. The case studies suggest that compatible building type and transportation distance are also factors. These barriers can be addressed by the clever integration of building information modelling tools with lean construction processes as part of a proposed strategy leading to smarter (more productive) and better (more sustainable) outcomes predicated on growth in digital construction practices. The paper concludes with a proposed framework for change that conceptualizes the ‘ecosystem’ needed to support widespread DfMA in the Australian context, including the paradigm shift from building to manufacturing/assembly, the displacement of workers from onsite to offsite activity, and the expansion of interdisciplinary design and construct collaboration.",2021-08-17,2021,Craig Langston; Weiwei Zhang,Bond University,Sustainability,51,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169219,Advanced_Manufacturing,Building information modeling; Context (archaeology); Engineering; Integrated project delivery; Mindset,0.792

W3118978610,Effective regulations of FinTech innovations: the case of China,"In recent years, China has witnessed the rapid development of FinTech and become a leading country in the world. However, the regulatory mode under the traditional regulatory framework in China is difficult to effectively deal with the potential risks of FinTech innovations, which leads to frequent risk events. Firstly, based on the in-depth analysis of some research reports and regulatory policies, we clearly define the development status and essential characteristics of FinTech companies and regulatory authorities. Secondly, we construct a two-player evolutionary game model to depict the evolutionary game behavior between FinTech companies and regulatory authorities and analyze influencing factors of their strategic choices. We find that strategic choices of FinTech companies are mainly affected by extra benefits from non-compliance innovation, rewards from compliance innovation and penalty intensity from regulatory authorities, and strategic choices of regulatory authorities are mainly affected by regulatory costs, social evaluation and negative externalities.

Non-synchronous inertia includes inertial support from various inverter-interfaced renewable energy sources and energy storage devices in the form of virtual or emulated inertia. In the proposed method, a multi-step approach is used to identify a matrix of parameters that estimates the overall non-synchronous inertial response. Firstly, motivations are drawn from the fundamental system requirements of adequacy in RoCoF and maximum deviation in frequency, for any credible contingency. A systematic classification of various contributors to the non-synchronous inertial response is also carried out. System-identification studies are then performed to identify various component-models that contribute to the non-synchronous inertia. The component models include a faster RoCoF-based response model, a relatively slower frequency deviation based model, and in some cases, a slow, integral-of-frequency based model. Lastly, the concept of releasable kinetic energy and non-linear estimation is used to identify the capability of the virtual inertia sources and improve the accuracy of the overall estimate. The developed methodology is tested in a microgrid network hosting a mix of renewable energy generations and battery energy storage systems. The estimate of non-synchronous inertia will help system operators to accurately estimate the maximum frequency deviation and the time to reach the maximum deviation for any credible contingency. The estimate can also help in deciding the type of virtual inertia that will best maintain frequency stability in the microgrid system.",2021-04-02,2021,Chitaranjan Phurailatpam; Zakir Hussain Rather; Behrooz Bahrani; Suryanarayana Doolla,Monash University,IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy,49,https://doi.org/10.1109/tste.2021.3070678,Advanced_Manufacturing,Microgrid; Frequency deviation; Inertia; Control theory (sociology); Phasor,0.375
W3206690214,A review of systems modelling for local sustainability,"Abstract The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a holistic and ambitious agenda for transforming the world towards societal well-being, economic prosperity, and environmental protection. Achieving the SDGs is, however, challenged by the performance of interconnected sectors and the complexity of their interactions which drive non-linear system responses, tipping points, and spillover effects. Systems modelling, as an integrated way of thinking about and modelling multisectoral dynamics, can help explain how feedback interactions within and among different sectors can lead to broader system transformation and progress towards the SDGs. Here, we review how system dynamics, as a prominent systems modelling approach, can inform and contribute to sustainability research and implementation, framed by the SDGs. We systematically analyse 357 system dynamics studies undertaken at the local scale where the most important SDG impacts and their initiators are often located, published between 2015 (i.e. SDGs’ inception) and 2020. We analyse the studies to illuminate strengths and limitations in four key areas: diversity of scope; interdisciplinarity of the approaches; the role of stakeholder participation; and the analysis of SDG interactions. Our review highlights opportunities for a better consideration of societal aspects of sustainable development (e.g. poverty, inequality) in modelling efforts; integrating with new interdisciplinary methods to leverage system dynamics modelling capabilities; improving genuine stakeholder engagement for credibility and impacts on the ground; and a more in-depth analysis of SDG interactions (i.e. synergies and trade-offs) with the feedback-rich structure of system dynamics models.",2021-10-13,2021,Enayat A.

W4288057914,"Examining supply and demand of cooling effect of blue and green spaces in mitigating urban heat island effects: A case study of the Fujian Delta urban agglomeration (FDUA), China","Blue and green spaces (BGSs) are used as the important resource to mitigate urban heat island (UHI) effect through their cooling effect. However, research on the supply and demand of cooling effect of BGSs is limited. This study used the Fujian Delta urban agglomeration of China as the study area. Based on multi-source data, we constructed the evaluation indicator system to quantify the supply capacity of cooling effect (CESC) and the demand level of cooling effect (CEDL), and revealed the law of spatial distribution and changes in the CESC and the CEDL. Moreover, we further analyzed the correlation, matching state and coupling coordination degree (CCD) between the CESC and the CEDL. The results showed that (1) in the study area, the CESC has a spatial distribution with a decreasing gradient from the inland BGSs with high elevations to the coastal urban areas, while the CEDL exists the opposite trend. The CESC is negatively correlated with the CEDL, and there is a clear spatial spillover effect. (2) The matching state between the CESC and the CEDL exhibits obvious polarization. An increasing number of areas might face shortage of cooling effect supply. (3) The CCD between the CESC and the CEDL is in a state of low coordination level. In eastern coastal urban areas, the incoordination of the CESC and the CEDL become serious increasingly. (4) In areas with ‘low supply-high demand’ and incoordination, the intensity of urban construction and the size of population should be controlled, and the BGSs should be improved to enhance the CESC. Meanwhile, in areas with ‘high supply-low demand’ and incoordination, spatial structure of land-use/land-cover should be optimized to improve the efficiency of cooling effect utilization. This research can provide a new perspective and scientific basis for the BGSs layout in order to achieve the mitigation of UHI effect.",2022-07-27,2022,Zhong-Jian Shen; Binghua Zhang; Ruhong Xin; Junyang Liu,University of Auckland,Ecological Indicators,44,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109187,Advanced_Manufacturing,Urban heat island; Urban agglomeration; Economies of agglomeration; Spillover effect; China,0.15
W4296129864,The economics of COVID-19: a systematic literature review,"Purpose A systematic, PRISMA-guided literature review was conducted using four databases (ProQuest, PubMed, EconLit and Scopus) to analyze research published between February 2020 and August 2021. This review included 31 studies out of 1,248 that were identified. Design/methodology/approach In addition to the serious health issues it causes, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) has a destructive impact on the global economy. The objectives of this study are (1) to examine the growing literature on variations of economic factors due to COVID-19 (2) to review the literature on the governmental response to the pandemic and (3) to discover the perspective and the gaps and outline the future avenues for further research. Findings All selected studies (31) have used the macroeconomic, household and health economic factors to analyze the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among these studies, 22 articles examined the economic consequences and macroeconomic activities, 7 analyzed microeconomic costs and healthcare trade-offs and 2 studies reviewed economic uncertainty and macroeconomic expectations. Research limitations/implications This study comprises the most relevant research articles to measure the economic consequences of COVID-19. As a result of the lockdown and other containment initiatives, price levels, employment and consumption patterns have all suffered. Practical implications Therefore, the government's requirement to develop policy tools and approaches to ensure a full recovery from the pandemic should lead to greater long-term economic resilience. Originality/value This study examines the economic implications of COVID-19, with the aim of not only analysing COVID-19's negative economic effects but also, those measures that provide new directions in the form of short-run economic impacts and policy decisions.",2022-09-15,2022,I.

W4283012881,A Narrative Review on the Collection and Use of Electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes in Cancer Survivorship Care with Emphasis on Symptom Monitoring,"Electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) applications promise great added value for improving symptom management and health-related quality of life. The aim of this narrative review is to describe the collection and use of ePROs for cancer survivorship care, with an emphasis on ePRO-symptom monitoring. It offers many different perspectives from research settings, while current implementation in routine care is ongoing. ePRO collection optimizes survivorship care by providing insight into the patients' well-being and prioritizing their unmet needs during the whole trajectory from diagnosis to end-of-life. ePRO-symptom monitoring can contribute to timely health risk detection and subsequently allow earlier intervention. Detection is optimized by automatically generated alerts that vary from simple to complex and multilayered. Using ePRO-symptoms during in-hospital consultation enhances the patients' conversation with the health care provider before making informed decisions about treatments, other interventions, or self-management. ePRO(-symptoms) entail specific implementation issues and complementary ethics considerations. The latter is due to privacy concerns, digital divide, and scarcity of adequately representative data for particular groups of patients.",2022-06-17,2022,Corina van den Hurk; Floortje Mols; Manuela Eicher; Raymond J.

W4308512599,Anti‐consumption behavior: A meta‐analytic integration of attitude behavior context theory and well‐being theory,"Abstract Researchers have given considerable attention to investigate anti‐consumption behavior. However, empirical research tends to report somewhat erratic and inconsistent findings. Accordingly, the relationships between the antecedents, and the outcome variables of anti‐consumption behavior, such as consumer well‐being, remain unclear. Thus, to fill this void in the literature, this study integrates Attitude Behavior Context (ABC) theory and Well‐being theory into a meta‐analytic framework and synthesizes the extant literature on anti‐consumption to examine concrete relationships between the contextual and attitudinal variables, anti‐consumption behavior and consumer well‐being. The findings show that ecological concern, religiosity, mortality salience, and perceived behavioral control influence anti‐consumption attitudes and intention, whereas consumer well‐being is the outcome variable of anti‐consumption behavior. To investigate the possible reasons for the inconsistent findings, we performed a moderation analysis which suggests that country of study, product type, data collection period, research methods and sample type may cause inconsistencies in the findings. This meta‐analytic study contributes to the anti‐consumption literature. Practically, the findings provide guidelines to policymakers and societal organizations interested in promoting anti‐consumption.",2022-11-08,2022,Haroon Iqbal Maseeh; Deepak Sangroya; Charles Jebarajakirthy; Mohd Adil; Jaspreet Kaur,Griffith University,Psychology and Marketing,43,https://doi.org/10.1002/mar.21748,Advanced_Manufacturing,Moderation; Consumption (sociology); Psychology; Consumer behaviour; Theory of planned behavior,0.15
W4309116698,Mixed Game-Based AoI Optimization for Combating COVID-19 With AI Bots,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a dramatic loss of human life has occurred and this trend presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, economic systems and social operations. Hence, it is urgent for us to take some countermeasures to restrain and dispel epidemic diffusion to the uttermost. Data freshness plays an inevitable role in timely infestor determination during this process. However, existing works pay little attention to optimizing this indicator in health monitoring. To make up this research gap, in this paper, we propose a mixed game-based Age of Information (AoI) optimization scheme, where the edge-based wireless technologies and AI-empowered diagnostic bots are adopted. Firstly, we establish the system model for Epidemic Prevention and Control Center (EPCC)-based health state monitoring network, where ultimate biosensing data is transmitted from AI bots via edge servers. Then, upon deriving AoI expression with a closed form, the minimization goal between edge servers and bots is specified. Simultaneously, we reformulate the AoI optimization problem from the mixed game viewpoint (i.e., coalition formation game and ordinary potential game), and then propose two algorithms for cooperative order-based bot deployment and stochastic learning-based channel selection. Finally, compared with the typical baselines, the experiment result shows our scheme can reach the lower AoI value for biosensing data transmission under different parameter settings.",2022-11-01,2022,Yaoqi Yang; Weizheng Wang; Zhimeng Yin; Renhui Xu; Xiaokang Zhou,Charles Darwin University,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,43,https://doi.org/10.1109/jsac.2022.3215508,Advanced_Manufacturing,Server; Computer science; Software deployment; Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution; Minification,0.15
W4281554663,Older Adults' Satisfaction with Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review,"Aims: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the satisfaction of older adults with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, assess preferences to telemedicine or in-person visits, and identify factors of influence on the satisfaction with telemedicine. Methods: The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Statement. A search through key electronic databases identified 228 citations. After duplicate record removal, and title and abstract screening, 43 articles were eligible for full-text review. Of these, 10 studies meeting the inclusion criteria of the review were finally included. Results: Older adults were satisfied with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients were in favor of telemedicine compared to in-person visits, but the evidence support for this preference was limited. Factors influencing satisfaction were identified and categorized under four main categories: system-related factors, patient-related factors, socioeconomic factors, and factors related to the nature of the medical intervention. Conclusions: Older adults were satisfied with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. A positive trend of preference toward telemedicine was observed, but not well established due to the lack of an objective measure of assessment. Technical issues related to the telemedicine delivery system were the main challenges. The socioeconomic status and level of education of older adults can relatively influence the level of satisfaction with telemedicine. The experience of older adults with telemedicine is still evolving and advanced technologies specifically designed to address their needs must be explored to increase the telemedicine uptake among the older adult population during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.",2022-05-25,2022,Nabeel H.

W4309862429,Do capital markets reward corporate climate change actions? Evidence from the cost of debt,"Abstract As a result of recurring natural disasters caused by climate change, firms are under enormous pressure to reconsider their environmental footprints. However, whether or not investors reward firms' climate change actions remains a topic of considerable debate. Using a sample of S&amp;P 500 companies over the period 2005–2020, we hypothesise and find a significant negative relationship between climate change actions and the cost of debt, indicating that investors indeed reward corporate climate efforts in the form of lower cost funds. This relationship exists in both environmentally sensitive and non‐sensitive industries and remains negative and statistically significant even after controlling for the impact of the ongoing pandemic (COVID‐19). The findings are robust to the use of alternative measures for our variables, alternative estimation methods and after controlling for endogeneity issues. We interpret our findings within the decision‐usefulness and stakeholder‐agency theories that suggest that non‐financial information on firms' environmental performance is becoming increasingly important when borrowers' creditworthiness is assessed. Our study offers important regulatory and academic policy implications.",2022-11-23,2022,Khurshid Ali; Muhammad Nadeem; Rakesh K. Pandey; Gurmeet S.

W4281385358,Understanding travel behavior adjustment under COVID-19,"The outbreak and spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic have had a significant impact on transportation system. By analyzing the impact of the pandemic on the transportation system, the impact of the pandemic on the social economy can be reflected to a certain extent, and the effect of anti-pandemic policy implementation can also be evaluated. In addition, the analysis results are expected to provide support for policy optimization. Currently, most of the relevant studies analyze the impact of the pandemic on the overall transportation system from the macro perspective, while few studies quantitatively analyze the impact of the pandemic on individual spatiotemporal travel behavior. Based on the license plate recognition (LPR) data, this paper analyzes the spatiotemporal travel patterns of travelers in each stage of the pandemic progress, quantifies the change of travelers' spatiotemporal behaviors, and analyzes the adjustment of travelers' behaviors under the influence of the pandemic. There are three different behavior adjustment strategies under the influence of the pandemic, and the behavior adjustment is related to the individual's past travel habits. The paper quantitatively assesses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual travel behavior. And the method proposed in this paper can be used to quantitatively assess the impact of any long-term emergency on individual micro travel behavior.",2022-05-24,2022,Wenbin Yao; Jinqiang Yu; Ying Yang; Nuo Chen; Sheng Jin,Australian Catholic University,Communications in Transportation Research,40,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commtr.2022.100068,Advanced_Manufacturing,Pandemic; License; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Travel behavior; Economic impact analysis,0.225
W4301367345,Silicon-based soft parallel robots 4D printing and multiphysics analysis,"Abstract Four-dimensional printing has set the stage for a new generation of soft robotics. The applications of rigid planar parallel robotic manipulators are also significant because of their various desirable characteristics, such as lower inertia, higher payload, and high accuracy. However, rigid planar parallel robots are heavy and require different actuators and components. This study introduces a novel technique to produce a light three degrees of freedom soft parallel manipulator at a low cost, which can be stimulated easily. This technique allows researchers to customize the actuator’s design based on the requirement. The robot is made by 3D printing based on fused deposition modelling and a direct ink writing process. The design, development, and additive manufacturing of a soft parallel robot electrothermally driven by a linear silicon-based actuator and polylactic acid parts are presented. Silicon-based soft actuators replace the rigid conventional linear actuators in this study to drive the planar parallel manipulator. The actuation of actuators is conducted using simple heating compared to the conventional rigid actuator. Various heating approaches and configurations are compared and analysed to find the most suitable one for the effective linear stroke of the soft actuator. The finite element model is used to analyse the performance of the electrothermally silicon-ethanol soft actuators in ABAQUS. The kinematics of the planar parallel robotic manipulator are simulated in MATLAB to achieve its workspace. The final soft parallel robot mechanism and the active and passive links are fabricated and tested experimentally.",2022-10-04,2022,Ali Zolfagharian; Saleh Gharaie; Abbas Z.

W4224313641,Veracity-aware and Event-driven Personalized News Recommendation for Fake News Mitigation,"Despite the tremendous efforts by social media platforms and fact-check services for fake news detection, fake news and misinformation still spread wildly on social media platforms (e.g., Twitter). Consequently, fake news mitigation strategies are urgently needed. Most of the existing work on fake news mitigation focuses on the overall mitigation on a whole social network while ignoring developing concrete mitigation strategies to deter individual users from sharing fake news. In this paper, we propose a novel veracity-aware and event-driven recommendation model to recommend personalised corrective true news to individual users for effectively debunking fake news. Our proposed model Rec4Mit (Recommendation for Mitigation) not only effectively captures a user's current reading preference with a focus on which event, e.g., US election, from her/his recent reading history containing true and/or fake news, but also accurately predicts the veracity (true or fake) of candidate news. As a result, Rec4Mit can recommend the most suitable true news to best match the user's preference as well as to mitigate fake news. In particular, for those users who have read fake news of a certain event, Rec4Mit is able to recommend the corresponding true news of the same event. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show Rec4Mit significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art news recommendation methods in terms of the capability to recommend personalized true news for fake news mitigation.",2022-04-25,2022,Shoujin Wang; Xiaofei Xu; Xiuzhen Zhang; Yan Wang; Wenzhuo Song,Macquarie University,Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2022,39,https://doi.org/10.1145/3485447.3512263,Advanced_Manufacturing,Misinformation; Computer science; Social media; Event (particle physics); Fake news,0.3
W4312204234,Can the marketization of urban land transfer improve energy efficiency?,"Local government intervention in land resource allocation can lead to the misallocation of land resources and serious pollutant emissions. As an important market-oriented economic reform in China, the marketization of urban land transfer (MULT) might have the potential to contribute to improving resource allocation efficiency by curbing local government intervention. Therefore, this study aims to provide empirical evidence on the impact of MULT on energy efficiency. We improve the MULT evaluation method to test the mechanism through which MULT affects energy efficiency. The results show that, first, the proportion of land sold by allocation and listing methods, which is characterized by a low degree of marketization, has rapidly increased in recent years, lowering the overall level of MULT. Second, MULT has a direct and significant positive impact on improving energy efficiency. Third, the mechanism analysis indicates that MULT helps enhance energy efficiency by advancing industrial structure optimization and technological progress. Moreover, the heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that the impact of MULT on improving energy efficiency differs significantly in different reform stages and between central and peripheral cities. This study sheds light on the importance of land resource allocation in improving energy efficiency and thus has practical policy implications for promoting low-carbon energy transition in emerging countries.",2022-12-23,2022,Yanjun Yang; Rui Xue; Xiaoxi Zhang; Yutai Cheng; Yuli Shan,Macquarie University,Journal of Environmental Management,38,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.117126,Advanced_Manufacturing,Marketization; Efficient energy use; Environmental economics; Resource allocation; Resource (disambiguation),0.225
W3015391807,The IntCal20 Northern Hemisphere Radiocarbon Age Calibration Curve (0–55 cal kBP),"Radiocarbon (C) ages cannot provide absolutely dated chronologies for archaeological or paleoenvironmental studies directly but must be converted to calendar age equivalents using a calibration curve compensating for fluctuations in atmospheric C concentration. Although calibration curves are constructed from independently dated archives, they invariably require revision as new data become available and our understanding of the Earth system improves. In this volume the international C calibration curves for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as well as for the ocean surface layer, have been updated to include a wealth of new data and extended to 55,000 cal BP. Based on tree rings, IntCal20 now extends as a fully atmospheric record to ca. 13,900 cal BP. For the older part of the timescale, IntCal20 comprises statistically integrated evidence from floating tree-ring chronologies, lacustrine and marine sediments, speleothems, and corals. We utilized improved evaluation of the timescales and location variable C offsets from the atmosphere (reservoir age, dead carbon fraction) for each dataset. New statistical methods have refined the structure of the calibration curves while maintaining a robust treatment of uncertainties in the C ages, the calendar ages and other corrections. The inclusion of modeled marine reservoir ages derived from a three-dimensional ocean circulation model has allowed us to apply more appropriate reservoir corrections to the marine C data rather than the previous use of constant regional offsets from the atmosphere. Here we provide an overview of the new and revised datasets and the associated methods used for the construction of the IntCal20 curve and explore potential regional offsets for tree-ring data. We discuss the main differences with respect to the previous calibration curve, IntCal13, and some of the implications for archaeology and geosciences ranging from the recent past to the time of the extinction of the Neanderthals.",2020-08-01,2020,Paula Reimer; William E.

W3037105506,Scientists' warning on invasive alien species,"ABSTRACT Biological invasions are a global consequence of an increasingly connected world and the rise in human population size. The numbers of invasive alien species – the subset of alien species that spread widely in areas where they are not native, affecting the environment or human livelihoods – are increasing. Synergies with other global changes are exacerbating current invasions and facilitating new ones, thereby escalating the extent and impacts of invaders. Invasions have complex and often immense long‐term direct and indirect impacts. In many cases, such impacts become apparent or problematic only when invaders are well established and have large ranges. Invasive alien species break down biogeographic realms, affect native species richness and abundance, increase the risk of native species extinction, affect the genetic composition of native populations, change native animal behaviour, alter phylogenetic diversity across communities, and modify trophic networks. Many invasive alien species also change ecosystem functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services by altering nutrient and contaminant cycling, hydrology, habitat structure, and disturbance regimes. These biodiversity and ecosystem impacts are accelerating and will increase further in the future. Scientific evidence has identified policy strategies to reduce future invasions, but these strategies are often insufficiently implemented. For some nations, notably Australia and New Zealand, biosecurity has become a national priority. There have been long‐term successes, such as eradication of rats and cats on increasingly large islands and biological control of weeds across continental areas. However, in many countries, invasions receive little attention. Improved international cooperation is crucial to reduce the impacts of invasive alien species on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human livelihoods. Countries can strengthen their biosecurity regulations to implement and enforce more effective management strategies that should also address other global changes that interact with invasions.",2020-06-25,2020,Petr Pyšek; Philip E.

W3015315333,The COVID‐19 pandemic and mental health impacts,"The newly identified novel coronavirus, COVID-19, was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. The COVID-19 virus is now known to belong to the same family as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which are zoonotic infections thought to have originated from snakes, bats, and pangolins at the Wuhan wet markets (Ji et al. 2020). The virus has rapidly spread across the globe leading to many infected people and multiple deaths (Wang et al. 2020); especially of the elderly and vulnerable (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020). While efforts to control and limit the spread of the pandemic in the community are quite straight forward to follow, it seems that prejudice and fear have jeopardized the response efforts (Ren et al. 2020). In fact, the COVID-19 pandemic has already unleashed panic, as evidenced by the empty toilet paper shelves in stores, resulted in accusations against people of Asian races (Malta et al. 2020), and impacted people's decisions to seek help when early symptoms arise (Ren et al. 2020). In this editorial, we discuss the issues related to the occurrence of fear, panic, and discrimination, analyse the causes of these phenomena, and identify practical solutions for addressing mental health issues related to this pandemic for both public and healthcare professionals. People tend to feel anxious and unsafe when the environment changes. In the case of infectious disease outbreaks, when the cause or progression of the disease and outcomes are unclear, rumours grow and close-minded attitudes eventuate (Ren et al. 2020). We know that the level of anxiety rose significantly when the SARS outbreak occurred. For example, in Hong Kong, about 70% of people expressed anxiety about getting SARS and people reported they believed they were more likely to contract SARS than the common cold (Cheng & Cheung 2005). Anxiety and fear related to infection can lead to acts of discrimination. People from Wuhan were targeted and blamed for the COVID-19 outbreak by other Chinese people and Chinese people have since been stigmatized internationally, for example, use of the term 'China virus' and the use of terms such as 'Wuhan virus' and the 'New Yellow Peril' by the media (Ren et al. 2020). Fear is a known (for centuries and in response to previous infectious outbreaks such as the plague), yet common response to infectious outbreaks and people react in many and individualized ways towards the perceived threat. Hypervigilance, for example, can arise because of fear and anxiety and, in severe cases, result in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or depression (Perrin et al. 2009). Fear of the unknown, in this case, the spread of the disease and the impact on people, health, hospitals, and economies, for example, raises anxiety in healthy individuals as well as those with pre-existing mental health conditions (Rubin & Wessely 2020). Individuals, families, and communities experience feelings of hopelessness, despair, grief, bereavement, and a profound loss of purpose because of pandemics (Levin 2019). Feelings of loss of control drive fear and uncertainty as the trajectory of the pandemics is constantly evolving; so is the advice on the action to take to stop the spread of a pandemic. Perceived mixed messaging from government or health officials can also lead to public confusion, uncertainty, and fear (Han, Zikmund-Fisher et al. 2018). People's responses to fear and intolerance of uncertainty lead to negative societal behaviours (Rubin & Wessely 2020). Uncertainty increases feelings of alarm resulting in behaviours targeted at reducing uncontrollable situations which people fear. For example, we have seen people clearing shelves of supermarkets resulting in global shortages of food and essentials such as toilet paper (El-Terk 2020). This behaviour is purported to occur for two reasons: one because the threat of COVID-19 is perceived as a 'real' threat and expected to last for some time and second as a means to regain control (El-Terk 2020). While outright panic as a result of this pandemic is unlikely, it can occur as a consequence of mass quarantine (Rubin & Wessely 2020). The current state of the COVID-19 illness already paints a picture of inevitable and large-scale quarantine – some of which are already occurring. In the case of mass quarantine, experiencing social isolation and an inability to tolerate distress escalate anxiety and fear of being trapped and loss of control, and the spread of rumours (Rubin & Wessely 2020). Rumours fuel feelings of uncertainty and are extricably linked to issues such as panic buying and hoarding behaviour. Anxiety related to this pandemic is also compounded by people being reminded of their own mortality that can lead to an 'urge to splurge', that is an increase in spending as a means to curb fear and regain control (Arndt et al. 2004). Throughout history, people have sought to allocate blame to someone in order to calm their fear of disease outbreaks (McCauley et al. 2013). This fear and othering is often present with pandemics. For example, the 2014 Ebola outbreak was considered an African problem resulting in discrimination against those of African descent (Monson 2013), while the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak in the USA saw Mexican and migrant workers targeted for discrimination (McCauley et al. 2013). In the past century, a number of serious outbreaks of influenza have developed in Southeast Asia, for example Avian H7N9 Influenza, 2013; H2N2 Pandemic, 1957-1958; H1N1 Pandemic, 1918 (Sugalski & Ullo 2018). The 'blame' for avian influenza has centred on Asian countries, and we see some world leaders dubbing COVID-19 the 'Chinese virus' (Chui 2020). Since January 2020, The UK and the USA have reported increased reports of violence and hate crimes towards people of Asian descent (Russell 2020) and an overall rise in Anti-Chinese sentiment (Rich 2020) as a result of the spread of COVID-19. Misinformation, public anxiety, and rumours must be addressed by Government and Health officials (Madhav et al. 2017), that help mitigate the adverse effects of stigmatization and help provide protection of vulnerable populations (DeBruin et al. 2012). Ultimately, to apportion blame in any circumstance can damage everyone involved and can reduce individual and community resilience both in the short and long term (Murden et al. 2018). Fear and guilt can also occur as a result of being infected by the virus. Infected people, while also the target of discrimination, also experience self-blame or guilt. Unfortunately, this feeling culminated in the suicide death of a health worker recently who feared she had contaminated seriously ill people she cared for while infected by COVID-19 (Giuffrida & Tondo 2020). Recovery from the negative impacts of this pandemic must include plans for addressing mental health issues for both public and healthcare professionals. Public health surveillance during and after this pandemic must include plans for mental health surveillance to allow for an adequate response to the anticipated mental health issues (Levin 2019). Fear and isolation of those who are sick or quarantined, breakdown of social support structures, disruption of everyday life that we take for granted, and mental health impacts on health workers are real and anticipated outcomes of this pandemic. Following the SARS outbreak in 2003, Chong et al. (2004) found that 77.4% of health workers caring for patients during the outbreak had mental health issues ranging from anxiety, worry, depression, somatic symptoms, and sleep problems. Despite the potential seriousness and impact on the mental health related to the pandemic in the infected patients and the community at large, most healthcare professionals have received relatively little training in the delivery of mental health care in the face of such pandemics (Xiang et al. 2020). Timely mental health care and mental healthcare training need to be developed and implemented as part of professional development activities (Xiang et al. 2020). As with any infectious disease outbreak, it is necessary for the Governments to take steps to quell the epidemic of fear that eventuates (Malta et al. 2020). Rapid communication about disease control and prevention is essential. Education campaigns should be launched to promote public health messages that prevent the spread of the disease and encourage the public to take proactive actions, such as reporting signs of illness to health professionals (Wang et al. 2020). Practical steps to manage our mental health during these difficult times include managing media consumption and accessing information which allows us to take practical steps to protect ourselves and our loved ones (World Health Organization 2020). Accessing non-official information can foster further, and often unnecessary, anxiety and panic (Johal 2009). Increasingly populations are being asked to stay in our homes for personal safety and the safety of others. Ensuring daily exercise activities, albeit for some of us in the confines of our home, have a positive impact on our mental health (Deslandes et al. 2009). As the physical distance from each other increases, finding ways to maintain our social connectedness is critical. Lack of interpersonal attachments is linked to poor physical, emotional, and mental health (Baumeister & Leary 1995). Setting up regular phone calls or video conferences with family, friends, and colleagues can bridge the gaps brought on by social distancing. As social beings, we need each other. As we are being asked to act in an increasingly unsocial way in order to overcome the challenges of this pandemic, we must remember that we are all in this together and act accordingly.",2020-04-10,2020,Kim Usher; Joanne Durkin; Navjot Bhullar,University of New England,International Journal of Mental Health Nursing,644,https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12726,Marine_Naval,Pandemic; Panic; Outbreak; Mental health; Prejudice (legal term),0.15
W3013204656,"Older people and COVID‐19: Isolation, risk and ageism","Internationally, health authorities and governments are warning older people that they are at a higher risk of more serious and possible fatal illness associated with COVID-19. Mortality data from Oxford COVID-19 Evidence Service (25/3/20) indicate a risk of mortality of 3.6% for people in their 60s, which increases to 8.0% and 14.8% for people in their 70s and over 80s. Therefore, the global recommendation for older populations includes social isolation, which involves staying at home and avoiding contact with other people, possibly for an extended period of time, currently estimated to be between three and four months. Older populations in this current context refers to people over 70 years and 50 years in some particularly vulnerable Indigenous populations. Social isolation includes avoiding social contact with family members and friends, organising the delivery of essential items, such as groceries and medications, where social contact is also to be avoided by maintaining a distance of two metres from the person delivering goods. Over the course of the pandemic, we have seen evidence of openly ageist discourses, which we argue, complicates the experiences of living through COVID-19 for older people. There have been distressing reports of older people abandoned in care homes (Keeley, 2020) and concerns about the representation and positioning of older people in the social media discourses around COVID-19. Ageism evident through phrases such as #BoomerRemover has emerged in relation to COVID-19. The hashtag #BoomerRemover has even been trending on social media platforms; often accompanied with ageist disparaging and devaluing memes (Sparks, 2020), as well as considerable media coverage and online discussions and commentary about potential for rationing of care with older people being potentially disadvantaged and positioned as more expendable than persons in other age groups. Some of the coverage seems to suggest that the death of older people somehow is not as important as loss of life of younger people (Haffower, 2020). These ageist discourses and the subtext of negativity and devaluing of older people can and will very likely contribute to feelings of worthlessness in older people, a sense of being burdensome and having no value. These factors when considered in relation to current social restrictions make older people particularly vulnerable to a range of negative health and social outcomes, particularly social isolation and loneliness. We know that loneliness is a real risk factor to the health and well-being of all people, and even in the best of times, older people can be more vulnerable to being lonely. Social circles can decline with ageing, due to factors such as the development of long-term conditions and deteriorating health, death of partners and friends, so older people may have fewer closer relationships and may be more likely to live alone (Victor & Bowling, 2012). Environmental barriers also impact on social isolation and loneliness of older people, such as the feeling of being unsafe in their neighbourhoods and there can be a lack of resources to support socialising or attending activities, leading to both boredom and inactivity (Cohen-Mansfield, Hazan, Lerman, & Shalom, 2016). Social isolation and loneliness are related but distinct concepts. Social isolation refers to a lack of contact with or physical separation from family, friends, or broader social networks and the lack of involvement in social activities (Valtorta & Hanratty, 2012) and is due to environmental restrictions, rather than an individual's ability to create or maintain social relationships (Tanskanen & Anttila, 2016). Loneliness is a complex, subjective emotion, experienced as a feeling of anxiety and dissatisfaction associated with a lack of connectedness or communality with others, and a deficit between the actual and desired quality and quantity of social engagement (Victor, Scambler, Bowling, & Bond, 2005). Social isolation and loneliness are correlated, albeit weakly (Steptoe, Shankar, Demakakos, & Wardle, 2013); however, these terms are often used interchangeably. The acknowledgement of social isolation and loneliness of older people is essential and paramount due to the detrimental impact on their physical and mental health, which has been recognised for over two decades. Social isolation and loneliness increases older people's risk of anxiety, depression, cognitive disfunction, heart disease and mortality (Barth, Schneider, & Kanel, 2010; Holt-Lunstad, Smith, & Layton, 2010; Santini et al., 2020; Shankar, McMunn, Demakakos, Hamer, & Steptoe, 2017). Prior to COVID-19, this was acknowledged in health and social care policies and campaigns. In the UK, the Campaign to End Loneliness (2011) created a network of national, regional and local organisations to work together to ensure that loneliness of older people remains a public health priority. Similarly, the government in New Zealand committed to a vision of positive ageing principles to promote community participation and prevent social isolation (Ministry of Social Development, 2001). There is also a need to recognise that older people who previously had not reported being socially isolated and lonely may be disproportionately affected by the requirements of social isolation due to COVID-19, because of the removal of social contacts, which may have occurred during grocery shopping, attending community groups and places of worship and other day-to-day activities. As well, older people may be adversely affected by the ageist discourses that may seem to imply that the loss of older life is not as important as loss of life of other age groups. Alongside, the recognition of the continued impact on older people who do not have friends or family members and rely on social care, who may feel further isolated, especially when services become disrupted. A further population of older people who are at risk of becoming more socially isolated are those residing in residential care homes, as their friends and family members are not currently permitted to visit. Therefore, there is an urgent need to support older people to mitigate the negative impacts on their physical and mental health from social isolation and ageist discourses around COVID-19. We must support older people to have and retain their connectedness and communality with others to better enable a sense of belonging. One immediate element that needs to be highlighted is the possibility of previously vigorous older people becoming increasingly frail due to reducing their activities, especially walking, and leading an (enforced) more sedentary lifestyle, which will likely impact on their mobility and well-being over time (Hartmann-Boyce, Davies, Frost, Bussey, & Park, 2020). Along with social isolation, social distancing has been recommended when older people leave their homes for essential items and exercise. The terms social isolation, self-isolation and social distancing have often been applied interchangeably potentially causing confusion. Self-isolation refers to remaining at home when someone has symptoms of COVID-19, been in contact with someone with symptoms, or on return from overseas; usually recommended for 14 days, rather than for an extended or continued time period. The advice for older people is to maintain social isolation for an extended period, with all the attendant risks that entails. One response from Public Health England on 29 March 2020 included the publication of guidance on maintaining mental health and well-being during COVID-19 social restrictions (Public Health England, 2020). The guidance for older people included the importance of staying connected and getting practical help, alongside the provision of an Age UK helpline phone number, but no advice on how to achieve staying connected, or how this could be achieved nationwide for every older person. There has been a media campaign to recruit volunteers to support older people who might otherwise have fallen through the cracks, but is this a robust and inclusive approach to ensure no older person is left isolated, or sustainable over an extended period of time? Other responses to socially support older people have included the development of social networks through online technologies, such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and other similar platforms. In the UK, one example is the development of social networks through WhatsApp, supported through the national Neighbourhood Watch scheme, encouraging people to get online and talk. Other initiatives wider than the UK include the Nextdoor App, a platform for neighbours and communities, which again encourages conversations and connections between people. These apps could create a sense of belonging for those who are able to engage with these technologies. Beyond this, online therapies such as cognitive behaviour therapy have been identified as potentially decreasing loneliness (Käll et al., 2020). Creative ways of supporting not only older people, but the general population, have also emerged, although the majority are delivered through online platforms, such as performances of symphony orchestras in virtual concert halls, or becoming a member of a virtual choir, playing board games online, and joining online masses and religious services. Indeed, the majority of advice is to connect with older people virtually which leaves those most disadvantaged vulnerable and at risk. However, although many older people are highly IT literate, there will remain disparities in access and abilities, and so alternative ways of supporting older people are imperative. Whilst mail deliveries continue, cards, letters and parcels provide other avenues to ensure older people feel connected with the outside world. A further way to support older people during the current health crisis could involve regular meaningful telephone conversations, to ensure meeting mental, social and physical health needs, and that older people know how to ask for and access help if required. Family members, friends, local charities, voluntary organisations and community nurses could develop comprehensive networks to ensure each older person has some meaningful social contact to support them. Through an organised and comprehensive approach, charities, organisations and healthcare providers could work together to support older people through this period of social isolation and to minimise and mitigate the negative impact of negative ageism, social isolation and loneliness.",2020-04-02,2020,Joanne Brooke; Debra Jackson,University of Technology Sydney,Journal of Clinical Nursing,613,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15274,Marine_Naval,Social isolation; Isolation (microbiology); Context (archaeology); Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Pandemic,0.358
W3007766830,Reversible structural evolution of sodium-rich rhombohedral Prussian blue for sodium-ion batteries,"Abstract Iron-based Prussian blue analogs are promising low-cost and easily prepared cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Their materials quality and electrochemical performance are heavily reliant on the precipitation process. Here we report a controllable precipitation method to synthesize high-performance Prussian blue for sodium-ion storage. Characterization of the nucleation and evolution processes of the highly crystalline Prussian blue microcubes reveals a rhombohedral structure that exhibits high initial Coulombic efficiency, excellent rate performance, and cycling properties. The phase transitions in the as-obtained material are investigated by synchrotron in situ powder X-ray diffraction, which shows highly reversible structural transformations between rhombohedral, cubic, and tetragonal structures upon sodium-ion (de)intercalations. Moreover, the Prussian blue material from a large-scale synthesis process shows stable cycling performance in a pouch full cell over 1000 times. We believe that this work could pave the way for the real application of Prussian blue materials in sodium-ion batteries.",2020-02-20,2020,Wanlin Wang; Yong Gang; Zhe Hu; Zichao Yan; Weijie Li,University of Wollongong,Nature Communications,530,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14444-4,Marine_Naval,Prussian blue; Materials science; Nucleation; Electrochemistry; Ion,0.15

Despite various solar absorbers having been demonstrated, these conditions are challenging to achieve simultaneously using conventional materials and structures. Here, we propose and demonstrate three-dimensional structured graphene metamaterial (SGM) that takes advantages of wavelength selectivity from metallic trench-like structures and broadband dispersionless nature and excellent thermal conductivity from the ultrathin graphene metamaterial film. The SGM absorbers exhibit superior solar selective and omnidirectional absorption, flexible tunability of wavelength selective absorption, excellent photothermal performance, and high thermal stability. Impressive solar-to-thermal conversion efficiency of 90.1% and solar-to-vapor efficiency of 96.2% have been achieved. These superior properties of the SGM absorber suggest it has a great potential for practical applications of solar thermal energy harvesting and manipulation.",2020-03-13,2020,Keng‐Te Lin; Han Lin; Tieshan Yang; Baohua Jia,Swinburne University of Technology,Nature Communications,504,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15116-z,Marine_Naval,Materials science; Optoelectronics; Metamaterial; Graphene; Selective surface,0.225
W3091396307,The burden of neurological diseases in Europe: an analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017,"Neurological disorders account for a large and increasing health burden worldwide, as shown in the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) Study 2016. Unpacking how this burden varies regionally and nationally is important to inform public health policy and prevention strategies. The population in the EU is older than that of the WHO European region (western, central, and eastern Europe) and even older than the global population, suggesting that it might be particularly vulnerable to an increasing burden of age-related neurological disorders. We aimed to compare the burden of neurological disorders in the EU between 1990 and 2017 with those of the WHO European region and worldwide.The burden of neurological disorders was calculated for the year 2017 as incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years of life lost, and years lived with disability for the countries in the EU and the WHO European region, totally and, separately. Diseases analysed were Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, epilepsy, headache (migraine and tension-type headache), multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, brain cancer, motor neuron diseases, neuroinfectious diseases, and stroke. Data are presented as totals and by sex, age, year, location and socio-demographic context, and shown as counts and rates.In 2017, the total number of DALYs attributable to neurological disorders was 21·0 million (95% uncertainty interval 18·5-23·9) in the EU and 41·1 million (36·7-45·9) in the WHO European region, and the total number of deaths was 1·1 million (1·09-1·14) in the EU and 1·97 million (1·95-2·01) in the WHO European region. In the EU, neurological disorders ranked third after cardiovascular diseases and cancers representing 13·3% (10·3-17·1) of total DALYs and 19·5% (18·0-21·3) of total deaths. Stroke, dementias, and headache were the three commonest causes of DALYs in the EU. Stroke was also the leading cause of DALYs in the WHO European region. During the study period we found a substantial increase in the all-age burden of neurodegenerative diseases, despite a substantial decrease in the rates of stroke and infections. The burden of neurological disorders in Europe was higher in men than in women, peaked in individuals aged 80-84 years, and varied substantially with WHO European region and country. All-age DALYs, deaths, and prevalence of neurological disorders increased in all-age measures, but decreased when using age-standardised measures in all but three countries (Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan). The decrease was mostly attributed to the reduction of premature mortality despite an overall increase in the number of DALYs.Neurological disorders are the third most common cause of disability and premature death in the EU and their prevalence and burden will likely increase with the progressive ageing of the European population. Greater attention to neurological diseases must be paid by health authorities for prevention and care. The data presented here suggest different priorities for health service development and resource allocation in different countries.European Academy of Neurology.",2020-09-29,2020,Günther Deuschl; Ettore Beghi; Franz Fazekas; Tímea Varga; Kalliopi A Christoforidi,Auckland University of Technology,The Lancet Public Health,504,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2468-2667(20)30190-0,Marine_Naval,Medicine; Disease burden; Burden of disease; Context (archaeology); Disease,0.15

W3005741104,Economic impacts of Wuhan 2019‐nCoV on China and the world,"Uncertainties over the Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has killed at least 1,775 people and sickened more than 70,000 as of February 17,1 has interrupted global trade and supply chains, depressing asset prices, and forced multinational businesses to make hard decisions with limited information. Wuhan has been identified as a principal financial hub for central China. It is a significant transportation and trade center, hosting the headquarters of the nation's major local steel and vehicle makers. The city also serves as home to more than 300 factories of the world's best 500 companies, including Microsoft, German software company SAP, and French car maker Groupe PSA.2 In recent years, its monetary development has been recorded to have surpassed China's national growth, with a GDP growth of 7.8% in 20192 as against the national average of 6.1%.3 After the spreading of the recent viral disease, numerous firms have now evacuated their expat workers from the city and temporarily halted business activities. The strict travel restrictions that have been enforced in Wuhan and different urban communities in Hubei are expected to have ripple effects throughout China and beyond, as far as trade is concerned. Among the industries that would be negatively impacted, retail, tourism, and hospitality sectors are likely to be most affected.4 With over 70 000 movie theatres closed down in mainland China,5 and several airlines canceling flights to and from China – disrupting tourism and other business activities – the economic impact of the novel coronavirus is already extending beyond the borders of Hubei. This impact is quite obvious in the rattled stock market.6-8 It is quite interesting how the lockdown of a province with a population just a bit less than that of France or the UK has threatened to be a blow to the global economy. This could be said to be amplified by the thorough integration of China, the second-largest economy behind the US, with the rest of the world. During the SARS-CoV outbreak in China from 2002 to 2003, the global economy was estimated to have lost roughly $40 billion.9 Currently, as China has an economy 8 to 9 times larger than it had during the SARS epidemic, and is even more connected to the rest of the world, experts believe that the total impact of the 2019-nCoV on global economy could be quite huge.4 As China now contributes approximately 16.3% of the world's GDP, the country has been the main growth driver worldwide, with the IMF estimating that China alone accounted for 39% of global economic growth in 2019.10 This implies that any slowdown in the nation's economy could likely send waves across the global economy.11 Figure 1 presents the growth of China's GDP and its share of the global GDP from 2003 to 2018. Source: World Bank, OECD When China reopened its essential businesses on Monday, February 3, 2020, the markets dropped sharply in value due to the extended Lunar New Year holidays. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 7.7%, shedding about $375 billion in market value in its steepest 1-day decline since August 2015. The Shenzhen Composite also experienced an 8.4% decline in value. Other business sectors, retail, consumer services, and transportation stocks too led the declines.12 According to IHS Markit Automotive, 11 of the Chinese provinces which are on strict lockdown account for more than two-thirds of vehicle production in the country. These provinces equally supply auto-parts to carmakers in the US, Europe, and South Korea. If the manufacturing companies remain idle until February 10, 2020, the experts believe that there could be production loss of about 350 000 units. This figure could skyrocket to over 1.7 million units if the outbreak situation continues until mid-March, equating to about 32.3% decline from precrisis expectations.13 Similarly, S&P believes the nation's auto-parts production could suffer up to a 50% decline. Some carmakers have already expressed concerns over the shortage of car parts. Hyundai has reported the shutdown of its domestic factories after running out of parts from China. The managers of various carmakers in the US and Europe have also expressed concerns over the likely disruptions in business if China does not resume a full supply of parts to them within a week.14 According to industry consultant LMC Automotive, China's auto market will shrink 3% to 5% in 2020 if the coronavirus outbreak continues into the second quarter.15 Aside the automotive industry, tourism across the world has been affected gravely due to the outbreak, as China is recognized by the United Nation Tourism Organization (UNWTO) as a true leader in global tourism, both as a source market and as a leading destination.16 The China Outbound Tourism Research Institute observed that 6.3 million Chinese tourists traveled abroad during the 2019 Lunar New Year holiday, generating travel revenue of around $73 billion, but the figures have reduced drastically in 2020.17 The impact on tourism beyond China is also significant, according to reliable sources. Due to Chinese tours being canceled and a general recession in domestic and international travelers, Vietnam's tourist industry is expected to lose up to $7.7 billion in the first 3 months of this year.15 As Chinese arrivals in Thailand are expected to decline by 80% in the first 4 months of 2020, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) estimates that the nation could loss $3.1 billion in revenue.18 Aside Vietnam and Thailand, the tourism industries of Indonesia, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia, and many more countries across the world are expected to be hit by the outbreak.19 When the loss of commerce, trade, tourism, and major impacts on global supply chains are taken into consideration, the economic impacts of the outbreak will be vast both within China and globally. A market diagnosis completed by Bloomberg economists, concludes that China's first-quarter GDP growth may slip to 4.5% year-on-year. According to an estimated modelling by the same experts, to analyze the expected losses to different countries across the world, the global GDP is likely to decline by roughly 0.42% in first quarter of the year due to the outbreak. This is illustrated in Figure 2. That notwithstanding, the Bloomberg economists believe that it is too early to tell the full impact of the fatal disease since the infection has not attained its peak yet.20 Source: Bloomberg Economics Some capital economists, however, estimate that, without urgent global actions to curtail the Wuhan 2019-nCoV within the shortest possible time, China is expected to lose up to $62 billion21 in the first quarter of the year, while the world is likely to lose over $280 billion within the same period.15 This conclusion compares closely to the World Banks estimation that even a weaker flu pandemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 viruses, could still wipe 0.5% off global GDP, which amounts to approximately $300 billion.22",2020-02-12,2020,Foster Kofi Ayittey; Matthew Kormla Ayittey; Nyasha Bennita Chiwero; Japhet Senyo Kamasah; Christian K.

W3163862021,Long‐term declines and recovery of meadow area across the world’s seagrass bioregions,"Abstract As human impacts increase in coastal regions, there is concern that critical habitats that provide the foundation of entire ecosystems are in decline. Seagrass meadows face growing threats such as poor water quality and coastal development. To determine the status of seagrass meadows over time, we reconstructed time series of meadow area from 175 studies that surveyed 547 sites around the world. We found an overall trajectory of decline in all seven bioregions with a global net loss of 5602 km 2 (19.1% of surveyed meadow area) occurring since 1880. Declines have typically been non‐linear, with rapid and historical losses observed in several bioregions. The greatest net losses of area occurred in four bioregions (Tropical Atlantic, Temperate North Atlantic East, Temperate Southern Oceans and Tropical Indo‐Pacific), with declining trends being the slowest and most consistent in the latter two bioregions. In some bioregions, trends have recently stabilised or reversed. Losses, however, still outweigh gains. Despite consistent global declines, meadows show high variability in trajectories, within and across bioregions, highlighting the importance of local context. Studies identified 12 different drivers of meadow area change, with coastal development and water quality as the most commonly cited. Overall, however, attributions were primarily descriptive and only 10% of studies used inferential attributions. Although ours is the most comprehensive dataset to date, it still represents only one‐tenth of known global seagrass extent, with conspicuous historical and geographic biases in sampling. It therefore remains unclear whether the bioregional patterns of change documented here reflect changes in the world's unmonitored seagrass meadows. The variability in seagrass meadow trajectories, and the attribution of change to numerous drivers, suggest we urgently need to improve understanding of the causes of seagrass meadow loss if we are to improve local‐scale management.",2021-05-16,2021,Jillian C.

Global assessments reveal that, among tetrapods, 40.7% of amphibians, 25.4% of mammals and 13.6% of birds are threatened with extinction3. Because global assessments have been lacking, reptiles have been omitted from conservation-prioritization analyses that encompass other tetrapods4-7. Reptiles are unusually diverse in arid regions, suggesting that they may have different conservation needs6. Here we provide a comprehensive extinction-risk assessment of reptiles and show that at least 1,829 out of 10,196 species (21.1%) are threatened-confirming a previous extrapolation8 and representing 15.6 billion years of phylogenetic diversity. Reptiles are threatened by the same major factors that threaten other tetrapods-agriculture, logging, urban development and invasive species-although the threat posed by climate change remains uncertain. Reptiles inhabiting forests, where these threats are strongest, are more threatened than those in arid habitats, contrary to our prediction. Birds, mammals and amphibians are unexpectedly good surrogates for the conservation of reptiles, although threatened reptiles with the smallest ranges tend to be isolated from other threatened tetrapods. Although some reptiles-including most species of crocodiles and turtles-require urgent, targeted action to prevent extinctions, efforts to protect other tetrapods, such as habitat preservation and control of trade and invasive species, will probably also benefit many reptiles.",2022-04-27,2022,Neil A.

W3094181094,A large-scale genome-wide association study meta-analysis of cannabis use disorder,"Variation in liability to cannabis use disorder has a strong genetic component (estimated twin and family heritability about 50-70%) and is associated with negative outcomes, including increased risk of psychopathology. The aim of the study was to conduct a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify novel genetic variants associated with cannabis use disorder. To conduct this GWAS meta-analysis of cannabis use disorder and identify associations with genetic loci, we used samples from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Substance Use Disorders working group, iPSYCH, and deCODE (20 916 case samples, 363 116 control samples in total), contrasting cannabis use disorder cases with controls. To examine the genetic overlap between cannabis use disorder and 22 traits of interest (chosen because of previously published phenotypic correlations [eg, psychiatric disorders] or hypothesised associations [eg, chronotype] with cannabis use disorder), we used linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate genetic correlations. We identified two genome-wide significant loci: a novel chromosome 7 locus (FOXP2, lead single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] rs7783012; odds ratio [OR] 1·11, 95% CI 1·07-1·15, p=1·84 × 10-9) and the previously identified chromosome 8 locus (near CHRNA2 and EPHX2, lead SNP rs4732724; OR 0·89, 95% CI 0·86-0·93, p=6·46 × 10-9). Cannabis use disorder and cannabis use were genetically correlated (rg 0·50, p=1·50 × 10-21), but they showed significantly different genetic correlations with 12 of the 22 traits we tested, suggesting at least partially different genetic underpinnings of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder. Cannabis use disorder was positively genetically correlated with other psychopathology, including ADHD, major depression, and schizophrenia. These findings support the theory that cannabis use disorder has shared genetic liability with other psychopathology, and there is a distinction between genetic liability to cannabis use and cannabis use disorder.

W3012279676,Unprecedented smoke‐related health burden associated with the 2019–20 bushfires in eastern Australia,"Weather conditions conducive to extreme bushfires are becoming more frequent as a consequence of climate change.1 Such fires have substantial social, ecological, and economic effects, including the effects on public health associated with smoke, such as premature mortality and exacerbation of cardio-respiratory conditions.2, 3 During the final quarter of 2019 and the first of 2020, bushfires burned in many forested regions of Australia, and smoke affected large numbers of people in New South Wales, Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. The scale and duration of these bushfires was unprecedented in Australia. We undertook a preliminary evaluation of the health burden attributable to air pollution generated by bushfires during this period. Using standard methods for assessing the health impact of air pollution,4 we estimated the numbers of excess deaths, hospitalisations for cardiovascular and respiratory problems, and emergency department presentations with asthma in NSW, Queensland, the ACT and Victoria between 1 October 2019 and 10 February 2020 that could be attributed to bushfire smoke exposure. We estimated population exposure to particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) for the regions of NSW, Queensland, the ACT and Victoria for which publicly available air quality monitoring data were available (for about 90% of the total population of these states). Data were obtained from the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment,5 the Queensland Department of Science,6 ACT Health,7 and the Environmental Protection Agency Victoria.8 We defined bushfire smoke-affected days as days on which the 24-hour mean PM2.5 concentration exceeded the 95th percentile of historical daily mean values for individual air quality stations. We estimated daily mean PM2.5 levels by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2), using station level data whenever at least one monitoring station was within 100 km of the SA2 centroid, and applying inverse distance weighting.9 Published population and health data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics,10, 11 the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare,12-15 and the NSW Ministry of Health were used.16 We quantified health outcomes by combining baseline incidence rates12-15 for each health outcome with daily exposure data and applying the relevant exposure–response risk coefficients for each outcome.17, 18 We also conducted sensitivity analyses with different PM2.5 thresholds for defining bushfire smoke-affected days. Further methodological details, including underlying assumptions and limitations, are included in the online Supporting Information. Our analysis of publicly available aggregated data did not require ethics approval. During the study period, PM2.5 concentrations exceeding the 95th percentile of historical daily mean values were recorded by at least one monitoring station in the study area on 125 of 133 days (Box 1). We estimated that bushfire smoke was responsible for 417 (95% CI, 153–680) excess deaths, 1124 (95% CI, 211–2047) hospitalisations for cardiovascular problems and 2027 (95% CI, 0–4252) for respiratory problems, and 1305 (95% CI, 705–1908) presentations to emergency departments with asthma (Box 2). Applying lower thresholds for defining bushfire smoke-affected days (no threshold, 90th percentile of historical values) did not markedly alter our findings; a higher threshold (99th percentile) reduced the estimates by about 20%. The highest population-weighted PM2.5 exposure level, 98.5 μg/m3 on 14 January 2020 (Box 1), exceeded the national air quality 24-hour standard (25 μg/m3)19 and was more than fourteen times the historical population-weighted mean 24-hour PM2.5 value of 6.8 μg/m3. * Data by state are included in the online Supporting Information. We have estimated the excess health burden during 19 weeks' continuous fire activity in the states most severely affected by smoke. Our estimates are based on air quality data from monitoring stations in the four eastern states — that is, we did not include data for smoke from all extreme fires in Australia during the study period — and we did not attempt to estimate health effects for which exposure–response relationships are less well characterised, such as primary health care attendances and ambulance calls. Detailed epidemiological analysis of more comprehensive exposure estimation and empirical health data will provide more complete information about the harms attributable to the severe air pollution associated with these unprecedented fires, but our findings indicate that the smoke-related health impact was substantial. Smoke is just one of many problems that will intensify with the increasing frequency and severity of major bushfires associated with climate change. Expanded and diversified approaches to bushfire mitigation and adaptation to living in an increasingly hot and fire-prone country are urgently needed.20 Nicolas Borchers Arriagada is supported by a Tasmania Graduate Research Scholarship from the University of Tasmania, a top-up scholarship from Asthma Australia, and a top-up scholarship from the New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment through the New South Wales Bushfire Risk Management Research Hub.

W3165417549,Unwelcome exchange: International trade as a direct and indirect driver of biological invasions worldwide,"Biological invasions are synonymous with international trade. The direct effects of trade have largely been quantified using relationships between imports and the number of alien species in a region or patterns in the global spread of species linked to shipping and air traffic networks. But trade also has an indirect role on biological invasions by transforming the environments and societies of exporting and importing nations. Here, both the direct and indirect roles of trade on biological invasions, as well as their interaction, are examined for the first time. Future trends in international trade, including e-commerce, new trade routes, and major infrastructure developments, will lead to the pressure on national borders soon outstripping the resources available for intervention. The current legislative and scientific tools targeting biological invasions are insufficient to deal with this growing threat and require a new mindset that focuses on curbing the pandemic risk posed by alien species.",2021-05-01,2021,Philip E.

W3110209994,"Physical activity, mental health and well-being of adults during initial COVID-19 containment strategies: A multi-country cross-sectional analysis","ObjectivesTo assess physical activity (PA), mental health and well-being of adults in the United Kingdom (UK), Ireland, New Zealand and Australia during the initial stages of National governments' Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) containment responses.DesignObservational, cross-sectional.MethodsAn online survey was disseminated to adults (n = 8,425; 44.5 ± 14.8y) residing in the UK, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia within the first 2-6 weeks of government-mandated COVID-19 restrictions. Main outcome measures included: Stages of Change scale for exercise behaviour change; International Physical Activity Questionnaire (short-form); World Health Organisation-5 Well-being Index; and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-9.ResultsParticipants who reported a negative change in exercise behaviour from before initial COVID-19 restrictions to during the initial COVID-19 restrictions demonstrated poorer mental health and well-being compared to those demonstrating either a positive-or no change in their exercise behaviour (p < 0.001). Whilst women reported more positive changes in exercise behaviour, young people (18-29y) reported more negative changes (both p < 0.001). Individuals who had more positive exercise behaviours reported better mental health and well-being (p < 0.001). Although there were no differences in PA between countries, individuals in New Zealand reported better mental health and well-being (p < 0.001).ConclusionThe initial COVID-19 restrictions have differentially impacted upon PA habits of individuals based upon their age and sex, and therefore have important implications for international policy and guideline recommendations. Public health interventions that encourage PA should target specific groups (e.g., men, young adults) who are most vulnerable to the negative effects of physical distancing and/or self-isolation.",2020-12-03,2020,James Faulkner; Wendy J.

W4311546538,A 2-million-year-old ecosystem in Greenland uncovered by environmental DNA,"Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene epochs 3.6 to 0.8 million years ago1 had climates resembling those forecasted under future warming2. Palaeoclimatic records show strong polar amplification with mean annual temperatures of 11-19 °C above contemporary values3,4. The biological communities inhabiting the Arctic during this time remain poorly known because fossils are rare5. Here we report an ancient environmental DNA6 (eDNA) record describing the rich plant and animal assemblages of the Kap København Formation in North Greenland, dated to around two million years ago. The record shows an open boreal forest ecosystem with mixed vegetation of poplar, birch and thuja trees, as well as a variety of Arctic and boreal shrubs and herbs, many of which had not previously been detected at the site from macrofossil and pollen records. The DNA record confirms the presence of hare and mitochondrial DNA from animals including mastodons, reindeer, rodents and geese, all ancestral to their present-day and late Pleistocene relatives. The presence of marine species including horseshoe crab and green algae support a warmer climate than today. The reconstructed ecosystem has no modern analogue. The survival of such ancient eDNA probably relates to its binding to mineral surfaces. Our findings open new areas of genetic research, demonstrating that it is possible to track the ecology and evolution of biological communities from two million years ago using ancient eDNA.",2022-12-07,2022,Kurt H.

W4361292570,Algorithmic urban planning for smart and sustainable development: Systematic review of the literature,"In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly put into use to address cities' economic, social, environmental, and governance challenges. Thanks to its advanced capabilities, AI is set to become one of local governments' principal means of achieving smart and sustainable development. AI utilisation for urban planning, nonetheless, is a relatively understudied area of research, particularly in terms of the gap between theory and practice. This study presents a comprehensive review of the areas of urban planning in which AI technologies are contemplated or applied, and it is analysed how AI technologies support or could potentially support smart and sustainable development. Regarding the methodological approach, this is a systematic literature review following the PRISMA protocol. The obtained insights include: (a) Early adopters' real-world AI applications in urban planning are paving the way to wider local government AI adoption; (b) Achieving wider AI adoption for urban planning involves collaboration and partnership between key stakeholders; (c) Big data is an integral element for effective AI utilisation in urban planning, and; (d) Convergence of artificial and human intelligence is crucial to address urbanisation issues adequately and to achieve smart and sustainable development. These insights highlight the importance of making planning smarter through advanced data and analytical methods.",2023-03-29,2023,Tim Heinrich Son; Zack Weedon; Tan Yiğitcanlar; Thomas W.

W3020849409,Why agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa remains low compared to the rest of the world – a historical perspective,"Agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa has, in recent times, remained lower than the rest of the world. Many attribute this to factors inherent to Africa and its people, such as climate, soil quality, slavery and disease. This article traces the role of agriculture through history and argues that these are not the main reasons. Before the arrival of European traders, complex agricultural systems existed, which supported food security, manufacturing and trade. External interference manipulated these systems in pursuit of export crops. Independence has not fundamentally changed this; resource and wealth extraction continue to inhibit economic development for Africans in Africa.",2020-05-05,2020,Vibeke Bjornlund; Henning Bjørnlund; André van Rooyen,University of South Australia,International Journal of Water Resources Development,232,https://doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2020.1739512,Marine_Naval,Agriculture; Rest (music); Independence (probability theory); Food security; Agricultural productivity,0.45
W3027472889,Towards Fair and Privacy-Preserving Federated Deep Models,"The current standalone deep learning framework tends to result in overfitting and low utility. This problem can be addressed by either a centralized framework that deploys a central server to train a global model on the joint data from all parties, or a distributed framework that leverages a parameter server to aggregate local model updates. Server-based solutions are prone to the problem of a single-point-of-failure. In this respect, collaborative learning frameworks, such as federated learning (FL), are more robust. Existing federated learning frameworks overlook an important aspect of participation: fairness. All parties are given the same final model without regard to their contributions. To address these issues, we propose a decentralized Fair and Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning (FPPDL) framework to incorporate fairness into federated deep learning models. In particular, we design a local credibility mutual evaluation mechanism to guarantee fairness, and a three-layer onion-style encryption scheme to guarantee both accuracy and privacy. Different from existing FL paradigm, under FPPDL, each participant receives a different version of the FL model with performance commensurate with his contributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FPPDL balances fairness, privacy and accuracy. It enables federated learning ecosystems to detect and isolate low-contribution parties, thereby promoting responsible participation.",2020-05-21,2020,Lingjuan Lyu; Jiangshan Yu; Karthik Nandakumar; Yitong Li; Xingjun Ma,Monash University,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,220,https://doi.org/10.1109/tpds.2020.2996273,Marine_Naval,Computer science; Federated learning; Overfitting; Single point of failure; Credibility,0.225

W3196897376,Streamflow prediction using an integrated methodology based on convolutional neural network and long short-term memory networks,"Streamflow (Qflow) prediction is one of the essential steps for the reliable and robust water resources planning and management. It is highly vital for hydropower operation, agricultural planning, and flood control. In this study, the convolution neural network (CNN) and Long-Short-term Memory network (LSTM) are combined to make a new integrated model called CNN-LSTM to predict the hourly Qflow (short-term) at Brisbane River and Teewah Creek, Australia. The CNN layers were used to extract the features of Qflow time-series, while the LSTM networks use these features from CNN for Qflow time series prediction. The proposed CNN-LSTM model is benchmarked against the standalone model CNN, LSTM, and Deep Neural Network models and several conventional artificial intelligence (AI) models. Qflow prediction is conducted for different time intervals with the length of 1-Week, 2-Weeks, 4-Weeks, and 9-Months, respectively. With the help of different performance metrics and graphical analysis visualization, the experimental results reveal that with small residual error between the actual and predicted Qflow, the CNN-LSTM model outperforms all the benchmarked conventional AI models as well as ensemble models for all the time intervals. With 84% of Qflow prediction error below the range of 0.05 m3 s-1, CNN-LSTM demonstrates a better performance compared to 80% and 66% for LSTM and DNN, respectively. In summary, the results reveal that the proposed CNN-LSTM model based on the novel framework yields more accurate predictions. Thus, CNN-LSTM has significant practical value in Qflow prediction.",2021-09-01,2021,Sujan Ghimire; Zaher Mundher Yaseen‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬; Aitazaz A. Farooque; Ravinesh C.

W4211025420,Digitalization and sustainability: virtual reality tourism in a post pandemic world,"The government-imposed COVID-19 pandemic control measures brought the tourism sector to a complete halt. However, virtual reality (VR) tourism offered people a way to escape the isolation. Media reports and research have noted heightened activity in VR tourism, which has been touted as “alternative tourism” and “eco-tourism”. However, scholars have yet to determine whether this shift is temporary or will persist after the pandemic is over. Questions also remain regarding the factors driving this behaviour. The present study uses stimulus-organism-response theory (SOR) to propose a sequential mechanism of the interplay of antecedents and outcomes, theorising VR tourism as a sustainable tourism solution long into the future. The model, tested by analysing 359 responses collected from VR users through Prolific Academic, confirmed the positive association of the environmental impact of touristic travel and pandemic travel anxiety with eco-guilt; pandemic travel anxiety, moreover, was also associated with attitude towards VR tourism. Furthermore, attitude towards VR tourism was positively associated with willingness to forgo the pleasure of in-situ tourism and post-pandemic VR tourism continuance intentions, with willingness also mediating the association between the other two. Finally, willingness partially mediated the association of attitude and fully mediated the association of eco-guilt with intentions.",2022-02-11,2022,Shalini Talwar; Puneet Kaur; Robin Nunkoo; Amandeep Dhir,Griffith University,Journal of Sustainable Tourism,218,https://doi.org/10.1080/09669582.2022.2029870,Marine_Naval,Sustainability; Tourism; Pandemic; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Business,0.225

If the social distancing had never been in place, the COVID-19 epidemic would result in 1,626,028 (95% CI, 764,622–2,487,434) infections and 92,254 (95% CI, 44,335–140,173) deaths. This suggests that social distancing would prevent 95.16% (95% CI, 93.23%–97.08%) of infections and 95.27% (95% CI, 93.40%–97.15%) of deaths in Hubei Province, respectively. Moreover, it will take more than 1 year to control the disease in this scenario. Similarly, the estimated numbers of confirmed cases and deaths were 14,356 (95% CI, 13,007–15,704) and 124 (95% CI, 103–146) outside Hubei (Figures 1B and 1D) in the presence of social distancing, and these two numbers became 71,732 (95% CI, 50,929–92,535) and 621 (95% CI, 418–824) in the absence of social distancing. This indicates that social distancing would prevent 80.29% (95% CI, 76.01%–84.57%) of infections and 79.66% (95% CI, 75.28%–84.04%) of deaths outside Hubei, respectively. We estimated that the social distancing measures might have reduced more than 95% of the epidemic in Hubei province and 80% of epidemic outside Hubei, compared with the absence of social distancing. This is consistent with previous evaluations based on various modeling approaches without considering face mask use.10Lai S. Ruktanonchai N. Zhou L. et al.Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain COVID-19 in China.Nature. 2020; 585: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar The difference in the effects of social distancing within and outside Hubei province may be due to multiple reasons, including the number of active cases, prevalence of infection in the population, and availability of medical resources. In the absence of social distancing, the disease can still be controlled with a high rate of face mask use. However, it will lead to more than a 20-fold increase in infections and deaths and take much longer. This indicates that even an extremely high rate face mask use cannot replace social distancing. In the post-epidemic era, social distancing should be still maintained to reduce the risk of a second outbreak. This study has several limitations. First, we did not model the variability due to changes in reporting criteria. This may introduce some bias to the projected estimates in the earlier time frames and cannot capture the sharp increase when the actual clinical diagnosis data and corrected death data (Figures 1A and 1C) were added. Second, our model cannot capture the second outbreak due to seafood market transmissions (Figure 1B), such as in Beijing city and Dalian city. Third, we did not consider the possible transmission from imported cases because the border control measures are so strict that the probability of this occurrence is extremely small. Fourth, the effect of asymptomatic infection is not involved, which may underestimate the infections in the absence of social distancing and thus the effectiveness of social distancing. We also did not consider that recovered individuals can be infected again due to the limited evidence on this. Despite these limitations, this study fills an important research gap by quantifying the impact of social distancing on the transmission of COVID-19 in China. We conclude that social distancing measures, imposed and orchestrated by the central government as a national response against the epidemic, have greatly reduced the number of infections and deaths both in and outside Hubei in China.

W3015680343,Highly Efficient All‐Small‐Molecule Organic Solar Cells with Appropriate Active Layer Morphology by Side Chain Engineering of Donor Molecules and Thermal Annealing,"Abstract It is very important to fine‐tune the nanoscale morphology of donor:acceptor blend active layers for improving the photovoltaic performance of all‐small‐molecule organic solar cells (SM‐OSCs). In this work, two new small molecule donor materials are synthesized with different substituents on their thiophene conjugated side chains, including SM1‐S with alkylthio and SM1‐F with fluorine and alkyl substituents, and the previously reported donor molecule SM1 with an alkyl substituent, for investigating the effect of different conjugated side chains on the molecular aggregation and the photophysical, and photovoltaic properties of the donor molecules. As a result, an SM1‐F‐based SM‐OSC with Y6 as the acceptor, and with thermal annealing (TA) at 120 °C for 10 min, demonstrates the highest power conversion efficiency value of 14.07%, which is one of the best values for SM‐OSCs reported so far. Besides, these results also reveal that different side chains of the small molecules can distinctly influence the crystallinity characteristics and aggregation features, and TA treatment can effectively fine‐tune the phase separation to form suitable donor–acceptor interpenetrating networks, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transportation, leading to highly efficient photovoltaic performance.",2020-04-09,2020,Beibei Qiu; Zeng Chen; Shucheng Qin; Jia Yao; Wenchao Huang,Monash University,Advanced Materials,212,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201908373,Marine_Naval,Materials science; Active layer; Annealing (glass); Organic solar cell; Molecule,0.15

W2999175327,Emerging learning environments in engineering education,"Three major challenges, sustainability, the fourth industrial revolution, and employability, will require new types of engineering programs, to help students develop skills in cross-disciplinarity, complexity, and contextual understanding. Future engineering students should be able to understand the needs for technological, sustainable solutions in context. The engineering graduates should be able to act in complex and chaotic situations. The question is how engineering institutions are responding now and how they should respond in the future. This article analyses the general responses from engineering education over the last 20 years. These responses are student-centred learning, integration of theory and practice, digital and online learning, and the definition of professional competencies. Examples are given of institutions that are already applying several of these components in the curriculum. On the long-term horizon, more personalised curriculum models are emerging based on students developing and documenting their own learning and career trajectories, as part of their lifelong learning strategy.",2020-01-02,2020,Roger Hadgraft; Anette Kolmos,University of Technology Sydney,Australasian journal of engineering education,211,https://doi.org/10.1080/22054952.2020.1713522,Marine_Naval,Employability; Lifelong learning; Curriculum; Context (archaeology); Engineering education,0.225
W4224308360,A Systematic Literature Review on Crop Yield Prediction with Deep Learning and Remote Sensing,"Deep learning has emerged as a potential tool for crop yield prediction, allowing the model to automatically extract features and learn from the datasets. Meanwhile, smart farming technology enables the farmers to achieve maximum crop yield by extracting essential parameters of crop growth. This systematic literature review highlights the existing research gaps in a particular area of deep learning methodologies and guides us in analyzing the impact of vegetation indices and environmental factors on crop yield. To achieve the aims of this study, prior studies from 2012 to 2022 from various databases are collected and analyzed. The study focuses on the advantages of using deep learning in crop yield prediction, the suitable remote sensing technology based on the data acquisition requirements, and the various features that influence crop yield prediction. This study finds that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the most widely used deep learning approaches for crop yield prediction. The commonly used remote sensing technology is satellite remote sensing technology—in particular, the use of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Findings show that vegetation indices are the most used feature for crop yield prediction. However, it is also observed that the most used features in the literature do not always work for all the approaches. The main challenges of using deep learning approaches and remote sensing for crop yield prediction are how to improve the working model for better accuracy, the practical implication of the model for providing accurate information about crop yield to agriculturalists, growers, and policymakers, and the issue with the black box property.",2022-04-21,2022,Priyanga Muruganantham; Santoso Wibowo; Srimannarayana Grandhi; Nahidul Hoque Samrat; Nahina Islam,Central Queensland University,Remote Sensing,210,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14091990,Marine_Naval,Deep learning; Crop yield; Computer science; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence,0.15
W3093526915,"Clustering, nano-scale precipitation and strengthening of steels","Continuous innovations in design of advanced structural steels are essential for future progress in manufacturing, automotive and construction industries. Events taking place at nano and atomic scales play crucial role in controlling the strength of steels. Recently, strengths of 1–1.5 GPa were realised in nano-scale precipitation strengthened steels. With availability of modern characterisation techniques, such as high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography, it is now possible to gain insight into the mechanisms of solute atoms clustering and formation of nano-precipitates, as well as their interactions with dislocations and resulting contribution to strength. In this review, the focus is on cluster formation and nano-precipitation in low temperature body centred cubic phases (ferrite, bainitic ferrite and martensite) in a range of steels from high strength low alloyed to maraging ones. Experimental and modelling data on nucleation and growth of these features is presented. The possible strengthening mechanisms are reviewed. Finally, future research areas and challenges for these classes of steels are critically discussed.",2020-10-23,2020,Zhiping Xiong; Ilana Timokhina; Elena V.

W3012257748,Deforestation in Colombian protected areas increased during post-conflict periods,"Abstract Protected areas (PAs) are a foundational and essential strategy for reducing biodiversity loss. However, many PAs around the world exist on paper only; thus, while logging and habitat conversion may be banned in these areas, illegal activities often continue to cause alarming habitat destruction. In such cases, the presence of armed conflict may ultimately prevent incursions to a greater extent than the absence of conflict. Although there are several reports of habitat destruction following cessation of conflict, there has never been a systematic and quantitative “before-and-after-conflict” analysis of a large sample of PAs and surrounding areas. Here we report the results of such a study in Colombia, using an open-access global forest change dataset. By analysing 39 PAs over three years before and after Colombia’s peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), we found a dramatic and highly significant increase in the deforestation rate for the majority of these areas and their buffer zones. We discuss the reasons behind such findings from the Colombian case, and debate some general conservation lessons applicable to other countries undergoing post-conflict transitions.",2020-03-18,2020,Nicola Clerici; Dolors Armenteras; Peter Kareiva; Rodrigo Botero; Juan Pablo Ramírez‐Delgado,Griffith University,Scientific Reports,207,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61861-y,Marine_Naval,Deforestation (computer science); Armed conflict; Habitat; Geography; Biodiversity,0.15
W4283696246,The cheetah optimizer: a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm for large-scale optimization problems,"Abstract Motivated by the hunting strategies of cheetahs, this paper proposes a nature-inspired algorithm called the cheetah optimizer (CO). Cheetahs generally utilize three main strategies for hunting prey, i.e., searching, sitting-and-waiting, and attacking. These strategies are adopted in this work. Additionally, the leave the pray and go back home strategy is also incorporated in the hunting process to improve the proposed framework's population diversification, convergence performance, and robustness. We perform intensive testing over 14 shifted-rotated CEC-2005 benchmark functions to evaluate the performance of the proposed CO in comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, to test the power of the proposed CO algorithm over large-scale optimization problems, the CEC2010 and the CEC2013 benchmarks are considered. The proposed algorithm is also tested in solving one of the well-known and complex engineering problems, i.e., the economic load dispatch problem. For all considered problems, the results are shown to outperform those obtained using other conventional and improved algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate that the CO algorithm can successfully solve large-scale and challenging optimization problems and offers a significant advantage over different standards and improved and hybrid existing algorithms. Note that the source code of the CO algorithm is publicly available at https://www.optim-app.com/projects/co .",2022-06-29,2022,Mohammad Amin Akbari; Mohsen Zare; Rasoul Azizipanah‐Abarghooee; Seyedali Mirjalili; Mohamed Deriche,Torrens University Australia,Scientific Reports,200,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14338-z,Marine_Naval,Metaheuristic; Computer science; Scale (ratio); Mathematical optimization; Algorithm,0.15

A comparative review of publications across three language contexts,"Many scholars across the world have studied the knowledge, skills and dispositions needed to use digital media. Yet as digital texts have proliferated and evolved, there has been much conjecture over what it means to be ‘digitally literate’. As literacy researchers from Australia, Sweden and Argentina we are concerned with the drive to standardise definitions of ‘digital literacy’ despite notable differences in the cultural politics of education in each country. This paper analyses how the term digital literacy has been conceptualised and applied by scholars in these three language contexts. To do this, we analyse the most cited publications on digital literacy in the English-speaking; Scandinavian; and Spanish-speaking contexts. In the analysis the variety of definitions across and within each context, the key tensions and challenges that emerge and the implications for digital literacy education are explored. Our findings reveal that similar tensions and challenges exist in all three contexts, however, the path to resolution varies given contextual differences.

Although many studies have investigated various benefits of Internet use, little attention has been paid to find the relationship between Internet use and the economic well‐being of rural households. This paper, therefore, investigates the effects of Internet use on household income and expenditure, using a sample of rural households from China. Both endogenous treatment regression (ETR) and unconditional quantile regression (UQR) techniques are used to identify the homogenous and heterogeneous effects of Internet use, respectively. The ETR results show that Internet use increases household income and expenditure significantly. However, the UQR results reveal that Internet use has a larger impact at the upper distributions of household income and expenditure.",2020-02-05,2020,Wanglin Ma; Peng Nie; Pei Zhang; Alan Renwick,Lincoln University,Review of Development Economics,195,https://doi.org/10.1111/rode.12645,Marine_Naval,The Internet; Quantile regression; China; Economics; Sample (material),0.208
W4378469471,ChatGPT versus engineering education assessment: a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional benchmarking and analysis of this generative artificial intelligence tool to investigate assessment integrity,"ChatGPT, a sophisticated online chatbot, sent shockwaves through many sectors once reports filtered through that it could pass exams. In higher education, it has raised many questions about the authenticity of assessment and challenges in detecting plagiarism. Amongst the resulting frenetic hubbub, hints of potential opportunities in how ChatGPT could support learning and the development of critical thinking have also emerged. In this paper, we examine how ChatGPT may affect assessment in engineering education by exploring ChatGPT responses to existing assessment prompts from ten subjects across seven Australian universities. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of current assessment practice and discuss opportunities on how ChatGPT can be used to facilitate learning. As artificial intelligence is rapidly improving, this analysis sets a benchmark for ChatGPT’s performance as of early 2023 in responding to engineering education assessment prompts. ChatGPT did pass some subjects and excelled with some assessment types. Findings suggest that changes in current practice are needed, as typically with little modification to the input prompts, ChatGPT could generate passable responses to many of the assessments, and it is only going to get better as future versions are trained on larger data sets.",2023-05-26,2023,Sasha Nikolic; Scott Daniel; Rezwanul Haque; Marina Belkina; Ghulam Mubashar Hassan,University of Wollongong,European Journal of Engineering Education,192,https://doi.org/10.1080/03043797.2023.2213169,Marine_Naval,Benchmarking; Strengths and weaknesses; Multidisciplinary approach; Artificial intelligence; Generative grammar,0.3

In particular, the ability of devices to capture ultra-high definition (UHD) images and video places new demands on the image processing pipeline. In this paper, we consider the task of low-light image enhancement (LLIE) and introduce a large-scale database consisting of images at 4K and 8K resolution. We conduct systematic benchmarking studies and provide a comparison of current LLIE algorithms. As a second contribution, we introduce LLFormer, a transformer-based low-light enhancement method.

W3029714170,Caring during COVID‐19: A gendered analysis of Australian university responses to managing remote working and caring responsibilities,"COVID-19 is dramatically reconfiguring paid work and care. Emerging evidence in the global media suggests that academic women with caring responsibilities are being disproportionately impacted. This article fills a key knowledge gap by examining how Australian universities are supporting academics to manage remote work and caring during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a desktop analysis of public information about remote working and care from 41 Australian universities and compared them to the world's top ten ranked universities. Findings suggest that during the pandemic, the Australian higher education sector positions decisions about caring leave and participation in the paid labour force as 'private' matters in which employees (mainly women) design their own 'solutions' when compared with international institutional counterparts.

In fact, WHO warns that urban air quality is a subject of increasing concern, where the number of urban residents now exposed to air pollution is 2·5 times higher than recommended, leading to an increasing number of patients with respiratory diseases, cancer, and heart diseases globally, affecting the global economy with estimated direct damages of between US$2 and $4 billion per annum by 2030.3WHOClimate change and health.https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-healthDate: Oct 30, 2021Date accessed: November 15, 2021Google ScholarAdditionally, increasing greenhouse gas emissions directly threaten the livelihood of communities; as of February, 2021, the number of deaths related to air pollution was more than 3·91 million in China and 2·46 million in India, accounting for more than a third of all deaths in India.4Sreedhar N One third of deaths in India every year are due to air pollution.https://lifestyle.livemint.com/smart-living/environment/onethird-of-indians-die-due-to-air-pollution-every-year-111612855290031.htmlDate: Feb 9, 2021Date accessed: May 12, 2021Google Scholar These numbers exclude deaths resulting from other complications such as heatwaves, malnutrition, and climate change-related events. This finding shows that unless emissions are substantially reduced globally as a matter of urgency, the situation of deteriorating air quality will worsen, with subsequent deaths, economic loss, and other challenges affecting many countries across the globe.However, the issue of urban liveability cannot be approached via linear decarbonisation policies alone, because changing the 78% of energy consumed by different sectors in cities would need to be achieved without compromising liveability. Urban liveability demands societal cohesion and bonding, which is present and higher in human-scale cities (a city designed optimally for human use) compared with contemporary cities. This demand is shown by the latest ranking on the Urban Liveability Index 2021,5Economic Intelligence UnitThe Global Liveability Index 2021.https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/global-liveability-index-2021Date: 2021Date accessed: December 17, 2021Google Scholar where cities that managed to promote social spaces such as allowing schools, restaurants, recreation centres, and other social spaces to stay open during the pandemic were ranked higher; including Auckland, Osaka, Adelaide, Wellington, Tokyo, Zurich, and others. Therefore, the aim of producing coherent decarbonisation policies should also increasing liveability, which can in turn repair societal fractures and improve economic equity.The COVID-19 pandemic shone light on an emerging model, the 15-minute city, when the resilience of contemporary cities was tested.

Beyond traditional population and services density quotas, increasing access to urban amenities can result in optimal consumption being achieved without constraining available resources. This planning model also envisions mixed-used built environments accommodating residential, commercial, and entertainment functions, and at the same time promoting multiculturalism. With this model, health, social interactions, and relationships can be fostered and promoted.The higher density (of population and services) and diversity from this model results in shorter travel distances, motorised traffic is replaced with active travel, leading to lower CO2 and air pollution emissions and better air quality. The resulting freed public space can be used for green spaces, contributing to some extent to carbon sequestration and reducing urban heat island effects. Noise levels will be reduced too. Altogether, these factors will lead to better citizen health, with a reduction in health complications such as premature mortality and diseases of the cardiovascular and respiratory system, obesity, brain diseases (eg, Alzheimer's disease), and cancer.10Nieuwenhuijsen M J Urban and transport planning pathways to carbon neutral, liveable and healthy cities; a review of the current evidence.Environ Int. 2020; 140105661Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google ScholarDigitalisation makes it possible for progress to be made in the other three dimensions, especially via data gathering through Internet of Things networks, resulting in better informed decisions along with the potential to automate different urban processes, producing more opportunities to achieve sustainability outcomes coupled with increased urban efficiency.The 15-minute city concept builds on previous works of urban thinkers such as Christopher Alexander, Jane Jacobs, Nikos Salingaros, and Leon Krier, who collectively advocate for cities that respond to both human needs and environmental sensibilities. To achieve this we need to enhance human interactions and social complexities via the improved connection of urban components such as residential areas, walkways, markets, schools, recreation centres, and parks. In this process of urban regeneration, or that of creating urban life, their is important to include local communities, because they would be the main stakeholders who will live with the urban outcomes. The four dimensions of the 15-minute city can thus be carefully studied at varying urban stages to ensure stronger sustainability outcomes at the same time as building higher social coherence, inclusivity, and economic equity. The pursuit of achieving wholeness, where components are ordered in a particular way to produce a complex and complete whole as promoted by Alexander,11Alexander C The process of creating life: the nature of order, book 2: an essay of the art of building and the nature of the universe. The Center for Environmental Structure, Berkeley, CA2004Google Scholar is a key component in cohesive decarbonisation policies, because linear approaches focusing only on quotas will not work.The subject of net-zero urban futures will soon be popular in light of the COP26 discussions, but it is necessary to proceed carefully with linear models focusing solely on emissions reduction. A whole-systems approach should instead be adopted, focusing on a range of different aspects such as urban planning, climate action, air quality, liveability, and health, among others. In addition, there is a need for cohesive solutions that can reduce emissions at the same time as increasing urban liveability and also repairing the socioeconomic fractures caused by contemporary urban planning principles. The 15-minute city appears to be a viable solution, based on sound human-scale principles, and further research can help policy makers understand how to operationalise this model in varying geographies. In the countdown to The UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), two crucial reports, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 6th Assessment Report and the Nationally Determined Contributions synthesis report by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, have highlighted that global temperatures are poised to rise by 2·7°C by mid-century, substantially higher than the preferred 1·5°C more than preindustrial temperatures pledged in the Paris Agreement.1Intergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeClimate change 2021.

However, this pursuit of economic stability, liveability, and emissions reduction will be a challenging endeavour, because more than 60% of global greenhouse gases are attributed to cities. In fact, WHO warns that urban air quality is a subject of increasing concern, where the number of urban residents now exposed to air pollution is 2·5 times higher than recommended, leading to an increasing number of patients with respiratory diseases, cancer, and heart diseases globally, affecting the global economy with estimated direct damages of between US$2 and $4 billion per annum by 2030.3WHOClimate change and health.https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-healthDate: Oct 30, 2021Date accessed: November 15, 2021Google Scholar Additionally, increasing greenhouse gas emissions directly threaten the livelihood of communities; as of February, 2021, the number of deaths related to air pollution was more than 3·91 million in China and 2·46 million in India, accounting for more than a third of all deaths in India.4Sreedhar N One third of deaths in India every year are due to air pollution.https://lifestyle.livemint.com/smart-living/environment/onethird-of-indians-die-due-to-air-pollution-every-year-111612855290031.htmlDate: Feb 9, 2021Date accessed: May 12, 2021Google Scholar These numbers exclude deaths resulting from other complications such as heatwaves, malnutrition, and climate change-related events. This finding shows that unless emissions are substantially reduced globally as a matter of urgency, the situation of deteriorating air quality will worsen, with subsequent deaths, economic loss, and other challenges affecting many countries across the globe. However, the issue of urban liveability cannot be approached via linear decarbonisation policies alone, because changing the 78% of energy consumed by different sectors in cities would need to be achieved without compromising liveability. Urban liveability demands societal cohesion and bonding, which is present and higher in human-scale cities (a city designed optimally for human use) compared with contemporary cities. This demand is shown by the latest ranking on the Urban Liveability Index 2021,5Economic Intelligence UnitThe Global Liveability Index 2021.https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/global-liveability-index-2021Date: 2021Date accessed: December 17, 2021Google Scholar where cities that managed to promote social spaces such as allowing schools, restaurants, recreation centres, and other social spaces to stay open during the pandemic were ranked higher; including Auckland, Osaka, Adelaide, Wellington, Tokyo, Zurich, and others. Therefore, the aim of producing coherent decarbonisation policies should also increasing liveability, which can in turn repair societal fractures and improve economic equity. The COVID-19 pandemic shone light on an emerging model, the 15-minute city, when the resilience of contemporary cities was tested. Initially proposed in 2016,6Moreno C The quarter-hour city: for a new chrono-urbanism.https://www.latribune.fr/regions/smart-cities/la-tribune-de-carlos-moreno/la-ville-du-quart-d-heure-pour-un-nouveau-chrono-urbanisme-604358.htmlDate: Oct 5, 2016Date accessed: November 1, 2016Google Scholar the concept advocates for so-called chrono-urbanism, supporting the notion that proximity-based planning can help in reducing car dependency, and in effect reduce fuel consumption and subsequently pollution.

W2942826706,ACCESS-OM2 v1.0: a global ocean–sea ice model at three resolutions,"Abstract. We introduce ACCESS-OM2, a new version of the ocean–sea ice model of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator. ACCESS-OM2 is driven by a prescribed atmosphere (JRA55-do) but has been designed to form the ocean–sea ice component of the fully coupled (atmosphere–land–ocean–sea ice) ACCESS-CM2 model. Importantly, the model is available at three different horizontal resolutions: a coarse resolution (nominally 1∘ horizontal grid spacing), an eddy-permitting resolution (nominally 0.25∘), and an eddy-rich resolution (0.1∘ with 75 vertical levels); the eddy-rich model is designed to be incorporated into the Bluelink operational ocean prediction and reanalysis system. The different resolutions have been developed simultaneously, both to allow for testing at lower resolutions and to permit comparison across resolutions. In this paper, the model is introduced and the individual components are documented. The model performance is evaluated across the three different resolutions, highlighting the relative advantages and disadvantages of running ocean–sea ice models at higher resolution. We find that higher resolution is an advantage in resolving flow through small straits, the structure of western boundary currents, and the abyssal overturning cell but that there is scope for improvements in sub-grid-scale parameterizations at the highest resolution.",2020-02-05,2020,Andrew E.

W3135242599,A Hollow and Compressible 3D Photothermal Evaporator for Highly Efficient Solar Steam Generation without Energy Loss,"Solar steam generation offers a sustainable strategy to mitigate global clean water scarcity. To this end, 3D photothermal evaporators have attracted increasing research interest since they can significantly improve both evaporation rate and energy efficiency. However, compared to the 2D evaporators, the 3D ones consume more raw materials and occupy more storage space, which limits their applications for practical portable solar steam generation. To address this issue, a 3D hollow and compressible photothermal evaporator is designed and fabricated which can be compressed to less than one third of its original volume, thus enabling easier transport and storage. Moreover, under 1.0 sun illumination, all evaporation surfaces of this 3D evaporator are lower in temperatures than the surrounding environment, thus providing the unique advantage of zero energy loss to the environment during solar evaporation. Due to the all‐cold evaporation surfaces, during solar evaporation, the evaporator is able to harvest massive energy from both the surrounding air and bulk water, delivering an extremely high evaporation rate of up to 7.6 kg m −2 h −1 under 1.0 sun irradiation. Furthermore, seawater desalination tests demonstrate that the device has great potential for portable solar thermal desalination by delivering clean water with a salinity well below 50 ppb.",2021-03-02,2021,Ting Gao; Xuan Wu; Yida Wang; Gary Owens; Haolan Xu,University of South Australia,Solar RRL,178,https://doi.org/10.1002/solr.202100053,Marine_Naval,Evaporator; Evaporation; Solar desalination; Solar energy; Desalination,0.225

Design/methodology/approach Based on consumer spending data, the authors identify patterns of consumption displacement for the hospitality and retail sectors as defined by ANZSIC. We answer where, when, how, what and why consumption displacement happens. Findings The findings provide evidence of spatial and temporal displacement of consumption based on consumer spending patterns. Evidence of increased spending in some consumption categories confirms stockpiling behaviours. The hospitality sector experiences a sharp decline in consumer spending over lockdown.

Since June 2022, Copilot has officially been available for free to all students as a plug-in to development environments like Visual Studio Code. Prior work exploring OpenAI Codex, the underlying model that powers Copilot, has shown it performs well on typical CS1 problems thus raising concerns about its potential impact on how introductory programming courses are taught. However, little is known about the types of problems for which Copilot does not perform well, or about the natural language interactions that a student might have with Copilot when resolving errors. We explore these questions by evaluating the performance of Copilot on a publicly available dataset of 166 programming problems. We find that it successfully solves around half of these problems on its very first attempt, and that it solves 60% of the remaining problems using only natural language changes to the problem description. We argue that this type of prompt engineering, which we believe will become a standard interaction between human and Copilot when it initially fails, is a potentially useful learning activity that promotes computational thinking skills, and is likely to change the nature of code writing skill development.",2023-03-02,2023,Paul Denny; Viraj Kumar; Nasser Giacaman,University of Auckland,,194,https://doi.org/10.1145/3545945.3569823,Space_Aerospace,Computer science; Code (set theory); Natural (archaeology); Software engineering; Natural language understanding,0.225

Specifically, \emph{AdvCam} transfers large adversarial perturbations into customized styles, which are then ""hidden"" on-target object or off-target background. Experimental evaluation shows that, in both digital and physical-world scenarios, adversarial examples crafted by \emph{AdvCam} are well camouflaged and highly stealthy, while remaining effective in fooling state-of-the-art DNN image classifiers. Hence, \emph{AdvCam} is a flexible approach that can help craft stealthy attacks to evaluate the robustness of DNNs.",2020-06-01,2020,Ranjie Duan; Xingjun Ma; Yisen Wang; James Bailey; A. K.

Although many of these areas closely relate to the urban context, there is limited understanding of the trending AI technologies and their application areas—or concepts—in the urban planning and development fields. Similarly, there is a knowledge gap in how the public perceives AI technologies, their application areas, and the AI-related policies and practices of our cities. This study aims to advance our understanding of the relationship between the key AI technologies (n = 15) and their key application areas (n = 16) in urban planning and development. To this end, this study examines public perceptions of how AI technologies and their application areas in urban planning and development are perceived and utilized in the testbed case study of Australian states and territories. The methodological approach of this study employs the social media analytics method, and conducts sentiment and content analyses of location-based Twitter messages (n = 11,236) from Australia. The results disclose that: (a) digital transformation, innovation, and sustainability are the most popular AI application areas in urban planning and development; (b) drones, automation, robotics, and big data are the most popular AI technologies utilized in urban planning and development, and; (c) achieving the digital transformation and sustainability of cities through the use of AI technologies—such as big data, automation and robotics—is the central community discussion topic.",2020-12-01,2020,Tan Yiğitcanlar; Nayomi Kankanamge; Massimo Regona; Andrés A.

Several countries appeared to be reaching peak consumption of some meats, and three (New Zealand, Canada, and Switzerland) have reached this. Poultry consumption increased over time in most countries, and beef and mutton/lamb consumption decreased in many. Using cluster analysis, we divided countries into two clusters: one in which increases in GDP per capita matched increases in meat consumption; and a second one of nine countries, for which there was no association between per capita change in GDP and meat consumption. There was evidence of a tipping point around USD 40,000 of GDP per capita, after which increases in economic well-being do not lead to increased meat consumption.",2021-12-06,2021,Clare Whitton; Diana Bogueva; Дора Маринова; Clive Phillips,Curtin University,Animals,172,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11123466,Space_Aerospace,Per capita; Gross domestic product; Consumption (sociology); Prosperity; Agricultural economics,0.15

plugin. SCIP 7.0 provides additional support for decomposition algorithms. Besides im-
provements in the Benders’ decomposition solver of SCIP, user-defined decomposition
structures can be read, which are used by the automated Benders’ decomposition solver
and two primal heuristics. Additionally, SCIP 7.0 comes with a tree size estimation
that is used to predict the completion of the overall solving process and potentially
trigger restarts. Moreover, substantial performance improvements of the MIP core were
achieved by new developments in presolving, primal heuristics, branching rules, conflict
analysis, and symmetry handling. Last, not least, the report presents updates to other
components and extensions of the SCIP Optimization Suite, in particular, the LP solver
SoPlex and the mixed-integer semidefinite programming solver SCIP-SDP.",2020-03-30,2020,Gerald Gamrath; Daniel Anderson; Ksenia Bestuzheva; Wei‐Kun Chen; Leon Eifler,Monash University,,171,,Space_Aerospace,Solver; Computer science; Suite; Integer programming; Heuristics,0.225
W4223894396,Learning from natural sediments to tackle microplastics challenges: A multidisciplinary perspective,"Although the study of microplastics in the aquatic environment incorporates a diversity of research fields, it is still in its infancy in many aspects while comparable topics have been studied in other disciplines for decades. In particular, extensive research in sedimentology can provide valuable insights to guide future microplastics research. To advance our understanding of the comparability of natural sediments with microplastics, we take an interdisciplinary look at the existing literature describing particle properties, transport processes, sampling techniques and ecotoxicology. Based on our analysis, we define seven research goals that are essential to improve our understanding of microplastics and can be tackled by learning from natural sediment research, and identify relevant tasks to achieve each goal. These goals address (1) the description of microplastic particles, (2) the interaction of microplastics with environmental substances, (3) the vertical distribution of microplastics, (4) the erosion and deposition behaviour of microplastics, (5) the impact of biota on microplastic transport, (6) the sampling methods and (7) the microplastic toxicity. When describing microplastic particles, we should specifically draw from the knowledge of natural sediments, for example by using shape factors or applying methods for determining the principal dimensions of non-spherical particles. Sediment transport offers many fundamentals that are transferable to microplastic transport, and could be usefully applied. However, major knowledge gaps still exist in understanding the role of transport modes, the influence of biota on microplastic transport, and the importance and implementation of the dynamic behaviour of microplastics as a result of time-dependent changes in particle properties in numerical models. We give an overview of available sampling methods from sedimentology and discuss their suitability for microplastic sampling, which can be used for creating standardised guidelines for future application with microplastics. In order to comprehensively assess the ecotoxicology of microplastics, a distinction must be made between the effects of the polymers themselves, their physical form, the plastic-associated chemicals and the attached pollutants. This review highlights areas where we can rely on understanding and techniques from sediment research - and areas where we need new, microplastic-specific knowledge - and synthesize recommendations to guide future, interdisciplinary microplastic research.",2022-04-05,2022,Kryss Waldschläger; Muriel Brückner; Bethanie Carney Almroth; Christopher Hackney; Tanveer M.

W3020122185,How Are Smart City Concepts and Technologies Perceived and Utilized? A Systematic Geo-Twitter Analysis of Smart Cities in Australia,"“Smart cities” is a hot topic in debates about urban policy and practice across the globe. There is, however, limited knowledge and understanding about trending smart city concepts and technologies; relationships between popular smart city concepts and technologies; policies that influence the perception and utilization of smart city concepts and technologies. The aim of this study is to evaluate how smart city concepts and technologies are perceived and utilized in cities. The methodology involves a social media analysis approach—i.e., systematic geo-Twitter analysis—that contains descriptive, content, policy, and spatial analyses. For the empirical investigation, the Australian context is selected as the testbed. The results reveal that: (a) innovation, sustainability, and governance are the most popular smart city concepts; (b) internet-of-things, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicle technology are the most popular technologies; (c) a balanced view exists on the importance of both smart city concepts and technologies; (d) Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane are the leading Australian smart cities; (e) systematic geo-Twitter analysis is a useful methodological approach for investigating perceptions and utilization of smart city concepts and technologies. The findings provide a clear snapshot of community perceptions on smart city concepts and technologies, and can inform smart city policymaking.",2020-05-20,2020,Tan Yiğitcanlar; Nayomi Kankanamge; Karen Vella,Queensland University of Technology,Journal of Urban Technology,165,https://doi.org/10.1080/10630732.2020.1753483,Space_Aerospace,Smart city; Social media; Context (archaeology); Globe; Sustainability,0.525

W3033387047,Automating the Analysis of Fish Abundance Using Object Detection: Optimizing Animal Ecology With Deep Learning,"Aquatic ecologists routinely count animals to provide critical information for conservation and management. Increased accessibility to underwater recording equipment such as action cameras and unmanned underwater devices has allowed footage to be captured efficiently and safely, without the logistical difficulties manual data collection often presents. It has, however, led to immense volumes of data being collected that require manual processing, and thus significant time, labour and money. The use of deep learning to automate image processing has substantial benefits but has rarely been adopted within the field of aquatic ecology. To test its efficacy and utility, we compared the accuracy and speed of deep learning techniques against human counterparts for quantifying fish abundance in underwater images and video footage. We collected footage of fish assemblages in seagrass meadows in Queensland, Australia. We produced three models using an object detection framework to detect the target species, an ecologically important fish, luderick (Girella tricuspidata). Our models were trained on three randomised 80:20 ratios of training:validation datasets from a total of 6,080 annotations. The computer accurately determined abundance from videos with high performance using unseen footage from the same estuary as the training data (F1 = 92.4%, mAP50 = 92.5%), and from novel footage collected from a different estuary (F1 = 92.3%, mAP50 = 93.4%). The computer’s performance in determining abundance was 7.1% better than human marine experts, and 13.4% better than citizen scientists in single image test datasets, and 1.5% and 7.8% higher in video datasets, respectively. We show that deep learning can be a more accurate tool than humans at determining abundance, and that results are consistent and transferable across survey locations. Deep learning methods provide a faster, cheaper and more accurate alternative to manual data analysis methods currently used to monitor and assess animal abundance and have much to offer the field of aquatic ecology.",2020-06-05,2020,Ellen M.

W2999405078,Long-term spatio-temporal precipitation variations in China with precipitation surface interpolated by ANUSPLIN,"Climate changes significantly impact environmental and hydrological processes. Precipitation is one of the most significant climatic parameters and its variability and trends have great influences on environmental and socioeconomic development. We investigate the spatio-temporal variability of precipitation occurrence frequency, mean precipitation depth, PVI and total precipitation in China based on long-term precipitation series from 1961 to 2015. As China's topography is diverse and precipitation is affected by topography strongly, ANUSPLIN can model the effect of topography on precipitation effectively is adopted to generate the precipitation interpolation surface. Mann-Kendall trend analysis and simple linear regression was adopted to examine long-term trend for these indicators. The results indicate ANUSPLIN precipitation surface is reliable and the precipitation variation show different regional and seasonal trend. For example, there is a sporadic with decreasing frequency precipitation trend in spring and a uniform with increasing frequency trend in summer in Yangtze Plain, which may affect spring ploughing and alteration of flood risk for this main rice-production areas of China. In north-western China, there is a uniform with increasing precipitation frequency and intensity trend, which is beneficial for this arid region.

W3074351644,Perinatal Distress During COVID-19: Thematic Analysis of an Online Parenting Forum,"Background The COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted the whole of society, requiring rapid implementation of individual-, population-, and system-level public health responses to contain and reduce the spread of infection. Women in the perinatal period (pregnant, birthing, and postpartum) have unique and timely needs for directives on health, safety, and risk aversion during periods of isolation and physical distancing for themselves, their child or children, and other family members. In addition, they are a vulnerable group at increased risk of psychological distress that may be exacerbated in the context of social support deprivation and a high-risk external environment. Objective The aim of this study is to examine the public discourse of a perinatal cohort to understand unmet health information and support needs, and the impacts on mothering identity and social dynamics in the context of COVID-19. Methods A leading Australian online support forum for women pre- through to postbirth was used to interrogate all posts related to COVID-19 from January 27 to May 12, 2020, inclusive. Key search terms included “COVID,” “corona,” and “pandemic.” A three-phase analysis was conducted, including thematic analysis, sentiment analysis, and word frequency calculations. Results The search yielded 960 posts, of which 831 were included in our analysis. The qualitative thematic analysis demonstrated reasonable understanding, interpretation, and application of relevant restrictions in place, with five emerging themes identified. These were (1) heightened distress related to a high-risk external environment; (2) despair and anticipatory grief due to deprivation of social and family support, and bonding rituals; (3) altered family and support relationships; (4) guilt-tampered happiness; and (5) family future postponed. Sentiment analysis revealed that the content was predominantly negative (very negative: n=537 and moderately negative: n=443 compared to very positive: n=236 and moderately positive: n=340). Negative words were frequently used in the 831 posts with associated derivatives including “worried” (n=165, 19.9%), “risk” (n=143, 17.2%), “anxiety” (n=98, 11.8%), “concerns” (n=74, 8.8%), and “stress” (n=69, 8.3%). Conclusions Women in the perinatal period are uniquely impacted by the current pandemic. General information on COVID-19 safe behaviors did not meet the particular needs of this cohort. The lack of nuanced and timely information may exacerbate the risk of psychological and psychosocial distress in this vulnerable, high-risk group. State and federal public health departments need to provide a central repository of information that is targeted, consistent, accessible, timely, and reassuring. Compensatory social and emotional support should be considered, using alternative measures to mitigate the risk of mental health disorders in this cohort.",2020-08-18,2020,Bonnie R Chivers; Rhonda Garad; Jacqueline Boyle; Helen Skouteris; Helena Teede,Monash University,Journal of Medical Internet Research,151,https://doi.org/10.2196/22002,Space_Aerospace,Thematic analysis; Context (archaeology); Distress; Population; Psychology,0.225

This series of interventions focuses on capturing and understanding a still evolving movement called platform urbanism, which is centered around the growing presence and power of digital platforms in cities. This different mixture of capital-technology-cities tends to be more directly connected to consumers, more intent on rapid scaling, and more antagonistic to governments and incumbent industries. This series lays out how the emergence of platform urbanism is already provoking serious issues related to the oversight, operation, and ownership of urban services and spaces.

W3010954340,The Water Planetary Boundary: Interrogation and Revision,"The planetary boundaries framework proposes quantified guardrails to human modification of global environmental processes that regulate the stability of the planet and has been considered in sustainability science, governance, and corporate management. However, the planetary boundary for human freshwater use has been critiqued as a singular measure that does not reflect all types of human interference with the complex global water cycle and Earth System. We suggest that the water planetary boundary will be more scientifically robust and more useful in decision-making frameworks if it is redesigned to consider more specifically how climate and living ecosystems respond to changes in the different forms of water on Earth: atmospheric water, frozen water, groundwater, soil moisture, and surface water. This paper provides an ambitious scientific road map to define a new water planetary boundary consisting of sub-boundaries that account for a variety of changes to the water cycle.

This paper provides an ambitious scientific road map to define a new water planetary boundary consisting of sub-boundaries that account for a variety of changes to the water cycle. The current ""freshwater use"" planetary boundary, one of nine planetary boundaries, is based on allowable human blue water consumptive use (Figure 1). The planetary boundaries are a global environmental sustainability framework for identifying critical transitions or tipping points in the complex Earth System, based on control and response variables (Figure 2; see Box 1 for an overview of the planetary boundary framework and definitions of control and response variables). The current freshwater use planetary boundary has been set at 4,000 km3/year blue water consumption, the lower limit of a 4,000–6,000 km3/year range that is considered a danger zone, as ""it takes us too close to the risk of blue and green water induced thresholds that could have deleterious or even catastrophic impacts on the Earth System.""1Rockström J.

The planetary boundaries place scientifically defined guardrails for human perturbations that collectively delimit the ""safe operating space for humanity"" to enable continued development by keeping Earth in a manageable Holocene-like interglacial state (Figure 2). The planetary boundary framework is based on (1) identifying relevant biogeochemical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth System and (2) determining the limit of human perturbation of these critical processes. Crossing any of the planetary boundaries could destabilize essential Earth System processes.1Rockström J. Steffen W. Noone K. Persson Å. Chapin F.S.I. Lambin E. Lenton T. Scheffer M. Folke C.

For each boundary process/system, a critical value of a control variable is defined, whereby the Earth System response variable moves the Earth away from Holocene conditions (i.e., the past 11,700 years), that have led to the development and proliferation of human societies. The boundaries for biosphere integrity and biogeochemical flows are subdivided with different control variables covering different aspects of the Earth System response to anthropogenic perturbation. For the planetary boundaries climate change and ozone depletion, identifying and quantifying control variables is relatively easy, as they are well-mixed global systems, moreover with a single dominant human driver (ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases). In other words, since the eventual effect on climate or the ozone layer is independent of where in the world the greenhouse gases or ozone-depleting substances are emitted, respectively, these boundaries can straightforwardly be assessed in a ""top-down"" manner. Boundaries for land-system change, biosphere integrity, and freshwater use cannot be directly connected to a single, well-mixed global driver or indicator; the eventual effects on the Earth System depend on the types, rates, locations, and sequencing of processes, some of which have critical transitions that occur at local or regional scales. These boundaries therefore represent regulatory processes that provide the underlying resilience of the Earth System.1Rockström J. Steffen W. Noone K. Persson Å. Chapin F.S.I. Lambin E. Lenton T.

Changes in either of these boundaries themselves have the ability to drive the Earth System into a new state, away from Holocene conditions that have allowed the development and proliferation of human societies. The other boundaries, including water, have Earth System effects by operating through the two core boundaries. In simple terms, the dynamics and state of the planetary boundaries for water, land, ocean acidification, novel entities, and biogeochemical flows will contribute to the final outcome of the climate and biosphere integrity boundaries, which thus constitute the aggregate manifestation of the interactions among all the other boundaries. The planetary boundary positions are not equivalent to any specific threshold values in the control variables given the natural variability of Earth System dynamics, the limitations of large-scale environmental monitoring and modeling, and fundamental scientific uncertainty. Rather, the rationale is that planetary boundaries should be placed at a ""safe"" distance from potential critical thresholds or other more gradual detrimental developments. The planetary boundaries framework resolves this challenge by first focusing on defining the scientific range of uncertainty for each boundary definition. Here there are no normative judgments, only an attempt to carry out the best possible scientific assessment and disclose clearly the range of uncertainty. A normative step then follows whereby a precautionary principle is adopted (based on the complexity of the functioning of the Earth System and, in particular, interactions and feedbacks among Earth System processes) by placing the planetary boundary position, and thus the safe operating space for humanity, at the lower end of the uncertainty range for each control variable. When transgressing this boundary, humanity enters a ""danger zone,"" constituted by the uncertainty range. The upper range of the uncertainty range is the ""high-risk"" zone in terms of the scientific assessment of risks to trigger non-linear, irreversible changes that can destabilize the state of the Earth System and/or fundamentally change the ability of the Earth System to support human development. The final adoption of planetary boundaries, therefore, involves normative judgments of how societies choose to deal with risks and uncertainties of global environmental change.1Rockström J.

Water has been identified as one of the planetary boundaries highlighting the critical role played by water in the functioning and stability of the Earth System and that water is fundamentally inextricable from other parts of the Earth System and other planetary boundaries.

W3121188342,Big Data and Machine Learning With Hyperspectral Information in Agriculture,"Hyperspectral and multispectral information processing systems and technologies have demonstrated its usefulness for the improvement of agricultural productivity and practices by providing useful information to farmers and crop managers on the factors affecting crop status and growth. These technologies are widely used in a range of agriculture applications such as crop management, crop yield forecasting, crop disease detection, and the monitoring of agriculture land usage, water, and soil conditions. Hyperspectral information sensing can acquire several hundred spectral bands that cover the electromagnetic spectrum of an observational scene in a single acquisition. The resulting hyperspectral data cube contains a large volume of spatial and spectral information. The hyperspectral sequence of images or video further increases the data generation velocity and volume which lead to the Big data challenges particularly in agricultural remote sensing applications. This paper is structured to first give a comprehensive review of representative studies to provide insights into significant research efforts in agriculture using Big data, machine learning and deep learning with the focus on frameworks or architectures, information processing and analytics with hyperspectral and multispectral data. The potential for utilizing Big data, machine learning and deep learning for hyperspectral and multispectral data in agriculture is very promising. The paper then further explores the potential of using ensemble machine learning and scalable parallel discriminant analysis which takes into consideration the spatial and spectral components for Big data in agriculture. To the best of our knowledge, no similar review study on agriculture with Big data, machine learning and deep learning for hyperspectral and multispectral information processing has been reported. Furthermore, the potential of ensemble machine learning and scalable parallel discriminant analysis has not been explored in agriculture information processing. Experiments and data analytics have been performed on hyperspectral data from agriculture for validation. The results have shown the good performance of our approach.",2021-01-01,2021,Li-Minn Ang; Jasmine Kah Phooi Seng,University of the Sunshine Coast,IEEE Access,148,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3051196,Space_Aerospace,Hyperspectral imaging; Computer science; Big data; Multispectral image; Precision agriculture,0.433
W3136213226,Designing Deep-Based Learning Flood Forecast Model With ConvLSTM Hybrid Algorithm,"Efficient, robust, and accurate early flood warning is a pivotal decision support tool that can help save lives and protect the infrastructure in natural disasters. This research builds a hybrid deep learning (ConvLSTM) algorithm integrating the predictive merits of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network to design and evaluate a flood forecasting model to forecast the future occurrence of flood events. Derived from precipitation dataset, the work adopts a Flood Index ( I <sub xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">F</sub> ), in form of a mathematical representation, to capture the gradual depletion of water resources over time, employed in a flood monitoring system to determine the duration, severity, and intensity of any flood situation. The newly designed predictive model utilizes statistically significant lagged I <sub xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">F</sub> , improved by antecedent and real-time rainfall data to forecast the next daily I <sub xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">F</sub> value. The performance of the proposed ConvLSTM model is validated against 9 different rainfall datasets in flood prone regions in Fiji which faces flood-driven devastations almost annually. The results illustrate the superiority of ConvLSTM-based flood model over the benchmark methods, all of which were tested at the 1-day, 3-day, 7-day, and the 14-day forecast horizon. For instance, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the study sites were 0.101, 0.150, 0.211 and 0.279 for the four forecasted periods, respectively, using ConvLSTM model. For the next best model, the RMSE values were 0.105, 0.154, 0.213 and 0.282 in that same order for the four forecast horizons. In terms of the difference in model performance for individual stations, the Legate-McCabe Efficiency Index (LME) were 0.939, 0.898, 0.832 and 0.726 for the four forecast horizons, respectively. The results demonstrated practical utility of ConvLSTM in accurately forecasting I <sub xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">F</sub> and its potential use in disaster management and risk mitigation in the current phase of extreme weather events.",2021-01-01,2021,Mohammed Moishin; Ravinesh C.

W3159762179,Moving beyond the incorrect but useful paradigm: reevaluating big-leaf and multilayer plant canopies to model biosphere-atmosphere fluxes – a review,"The land surface models that provide surface fluxes of energy and mass to the atmosphere in weather forecast and climate models typically represent plant canopies as a homogenous single layer of phytomass without vertical structure (commonly referred to as a big leaf). This modeling paradigm harkens back to a 30–40-year-old debate about whether big-leaf models adequately simulate fluxes for vegetated surfaces compared to more complex and computationally costly multilayer canopy models. This article revisits that scientific debate. We review the early literature to place our findings in context and discuss recent advancements in roughness sublayer theory, observations of canopy structure and leaf traits, and computational methods that facilitate the use of multilayer models. Using a model with variable vertical resolution, we compare a multilayer canopy representation with the equivalent one-layer canopy to ask how well the one-layer canopy replicates the multilayer benchmark and to identify why differences occur. Comparisons with flux tower measurements at several forest sites spanning multiple years show that sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, gross primary production, and friction velocity for the one-layer canopy degrade in comparison to the benchmark multilayer canopy. For the forest sites considered, 5–10 canopy layers sufficiently reproduce the observed fluxes. Vertical variation of within-canopy air temperature, specific humidity, and wind speed in the multilayer canopy alters fluxes compared with the one-layer canopy. The vertical profile of leaf water potential, in which the upper canopy is water-stressed on dry soils, also causes differences between the one-layer and multilayer canopies. The differences between one-layer and multilayer canopies suggest that the land surface modeling community should revisit the big-leaf surface flux parameterizations used in models.",2021-04-29,2021,Gordon B.

W3195305167,Food Insecurity and Child Development: A State-of-the-Art Review,"Converging research indicates that household food insecurity impedes children from reaching their full physical, cognitive, and psychosocial potential. This state-of-the-art review examines the last decade of research to: (1) describe the impact of the severity and persistence of food insecurity on child development; (2) use a socio-ecological framework to examine significant proximal and distal factors which may interplay; and (3) outline directions for future research. We conducted a systematic review of six databases of published papers from 2011 to June 2021. The search was limited to high-income countries and children aged from birth to 12 years. From 17,457 papers, 17 studies were included in the final review. Transitioning between food security and food insecurity had a significant and lasting effect on academic/cognitive function and behavior (i.e., externalizing), however less clear relationships were seen for psychosocial outcomes and other behaviors examined (i.e., internalizing). There was significant variation in the measurement and thresholds used to define both food insecurity and child development outcomes. Subsequently, comparisons across studies are difficult. Several future recommendations, including incorporation of socio-ecological factors, is provided. In conclusion, this review supports the link between food insecurity and sub-optimal child development; however, there is an imperative to improve and extend current understanding to ameliorate the causes of food insecurity.",2021-08-26,2021,Danielle Gallegos; Areana Eivers; Peter Sondergeld; C.

However, unsustainable hunting is one of the most urgent threats to wildlife and ecosystems worldwide and has serious ramifications for people whose subsistence and income are tied to wild meat. Over the past 18 years, although research efforts have increased, scientific knowledge has largely not translated into action. One major barrier to progress has been insufficient monitoring and evaluation, meaning that the effectiveness of interventions cannot be ascertained. Emerging issues include the difficulty of designing regulatory frameworks that disentangle the different purposes of hunting, the large scale of urban consumption, and the implications of wild meat consumption for human health. To address these intractable challenges, wepropose eight new recommendations for research and action for sustainable wild meat use, which would support the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",2021-08-20,2021,Daniel J.

W4313399603,Severe climate change risks to food security and nutrition,"This paper discusses severe risks to food security and nutrition that are linked to ongoing and projected climate change, particularly climate and weather extremes in global warming, drought, flooding, and precipitation. We specifically consider the impacts on populations vulnerable to food insecurity and malnutrition due to lower income, lower access to nutritious food, or social discrimination. The paper defines climate-related ""severe risk"" in the context of food security and nutrition, using a combination of criteria, including the magnitude and likelihood of adverse consequences, the timing of the risk and the ability to reduce the risk. Severe climate change risks to food security and nutrition are those which result, with high likelihood, in pervasive and persistent food insecurity and malnutrition for millions of people, have the potential for cascading effects beyond the food systems, and against which we have limited ability to prevent or fully respond. The paper uses internationally agreed definitions of risks to food security and nutrition to describe the magnitude of adverse consequences. Moreover, the paper assesses the conditions under which climate change-induced risks to food security and nutrition could become severe based on findings in the literature using different climate change scenarios and shared socioeconomic pathways. Finally, the paper proposes adaptation options, including institutional management and governance actions, that could be taken now to prevent or reduce the severe climate risks to future human food security and nutrition.",2022-12-30,2022,Alisher Mirzabaev; Rachel Bezner Kerr; Toshihiro Hasegawa; Prajal Pradhan; Anita Wreford,Lincoln University,Climate Risk Management,142,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2022.100473,Space_Aerospace,Food security; Climate change; Business; Context (archaeology); Malnutrition,0.225
W3121998869,Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trends and Mitigation Measures in Australian Agriculture Sector—A Review,"Agriculture is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. It is one of the economic sectors that impacts both directly and indirectly towards climate change which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. There has been a continuous trend of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions reduction technologies, but any step taken in this direction must not negatively affect farm productivity and economics. For the agriculture sector to achieve reduced GHG emission, climate-smart activities and improved food security will be needed for this sector to become a climate-smart landscape. Climate-smart technologies are effective at targeting inputs to the fields, helping to lower greenhouse gas emissions. This article explores the key sources of carbon emissions within the agriculture sector and reviews efficient ways to GHG emission via Smart Farming technology. Based on the public archive GHG datasets, we have found that livestock farming is the largest GHG emission sector among other agricultural sectors and responsible for 70% of the total emission. Besides, we also show that Queensland is the largest agricultural GHG contributor compared to other states and territories. The article also captures any possible sources within smart farming that may contribute to carbon emissions and suggest ways to reduce GHG emissions. Besides, an Australian-based best management practice approach is discussed to review the emissions reduction strategy based on climate-specific technology to help the farmers and other stakeholders take environmentally-friendly agricultural decisions.",2021-01-20,2021,Heena Panchasara; Nahidul Hoque Samrat; Nahina Islam,Central Queensland University,Agriculture,141,https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11020085,Space_Aerospace,Greenhouse gas; Agriculture; Natural resource economics; Climate change; Productivity,0.225
W3202012450,Digital divide framework: online learning in developing countries during the COVID-19 lockdown,"This article showcases digital inequalities that came to the forefront for online learning during the COVID-19 lockdown across five developing countries, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Afghanistan. Large sections of population in developing economies have limited access to basic digital services; this, in turn, restricts how digital media are being used in everyday lives. A digital divide framework encompassing three analytical perspectives, structure, cultural practices and agency, has been developed. Each perspective is influenced by five constructs, communities, time, location, social context and sites of practice. Community relates to gendered expectations, time refers to the lockdown period while locations are interleaved online classrooms and home spaces. Societal contexts influence aspects of online learning and how students engage within practice sites. We find structural issues are due to lack of digital media access and supporting services; further that female students are more often placed lower in the digital divide access scale. Cultural practices indicate gendered discriminatory rules, with female students reporting more stress due to added household responsibilities. This impacts learner agency and poses challenges for students in meaningfully maximising their learning outcomes. Our framework can inform policy-makers to plan initiatives for bridging digital divide and set up equitable gendered learning policies.",2021-09-23,2021,Anuradha Mathrani; Tarushikha Sarvesh; Rahila Umer,Massey University,Globalisation Societies and Education,141,https://doi.org/10.1080/14767724.2021.1981253,Space_Aerospace,Digital divide; Agency (philosophy); Public relations; Sociology; Digital media,0.283
W3135131959,Combating Urban Heat Island Effect—A Review of Reflective Pavements and Tree Shading Strategies,"Pavements occupy about 40% of urban land cover, with 75–80% black top roads, playing a critical role in urban connectivity and mobility. Solar energy is absorbed and stored in pavements leading to an increase in surface temperatures. Decreasing green cover is further contributing to rise in regional temperatures. Due to this activity, the city experiences urban heat island (UHI). This study presents a critical review of the literature on mitigation measures to combat UHI using reflective pavements with an emphasis on durability properties and impacts of tree canopy. The strategies with a focus on application of chip seals, white toppings, and coatings were discussed. Role of surface reflectance, including those from asphalt and concrete pavements, albedo improvements, and technological trends, application of waste materials, and industrial by-products are presented. Also, urban tree shading systems’ contribution to pavement temperature and microclimate systems is presented.

W4367298578,Spatial flood susceptibility mapping using an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model,"Floods are natural hazards that lead to devastating financial losses and large displacements of people. Flood susceptibility maps can improve mitigation measures according to the specific conditions of a study area. The design of flood susceptibility maps has been enhanced through use of hybrid machine learning and deep learning models. Although these models have achieved better accuracy than traditional models, they are not widely used by stakeholders due to their black-box nature. In this study, we propose the application of an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model that incorporates the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) model to interpret the outcomes of convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models, and analyze the impact of variables on flood susceptibility mapping. This study was conducted in Jinju Province, South Korea, which has a long history of flood events. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), which showed a prediction accuracy of 88.4%. SHAP plots showed that land use and various soil attributes significantly affected flood susceptibility in the study area. In light of these findings, we recommend the use of XAI-based models in future flood susceptibility mapping studies to improve interpretations of model outcomes, and build trust among stakeholders during the flood-related decision-making process.",2023-04-28,2023,Biswajeet Pradhan; Saro Lee; Abhirup Dikshit; Hyesu Kim,University of Technology Sydney,Geoscience Frontiers,137,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2023.101625,Space_Aerospace,Flood myth; Computer science; Deep learning; Artificial intelligence; Process (computing),0.15
W4281787175,Enhancing supply chain performance using RFID technology and decision support systems in the industry 4.0–A systematic literature review,"Supply Chain processes are continuously marred by myriad factors including varying demands, changing routes, major disruptions, and compliance issues. Therefore, supply chains require monitoring and ongoing optimization. Data science uses real-time data to provide analytical insights, leading to automation and improved decision making. RFID is an ideal technology to source big data, particularly in supply chains, because RFID tags are consumed across supply chain process, which includes scanning raw materials, completing products, transporting goods, and storing products, with accuracy and speed. This study carries out a systematic literature review of research articles published during the timeline (2000-2021) that discuss the role of RFID technology in developing decision support systems that optimize supply chains in light of Industry 4.0. Furthermore, the study offers recommendations on operational efficiency of supply chains while reducing the costs of implementing the RFID technology. The core contribution of this paper is its analysis and evaluation of various RFID implementation methods in supply chains with the aim of saving time effectively and achieving cost efficiencies.",2022-05-31,2022,Bhuvan Unhelkar; S.

W4281708496,The imbalance of food and biofuel markets amid Ukraine-Russia crisis: A systems thinking perspective,"The Ukraine war has immensely affected both food and energy systems due to the significant role of Russia in supplying natural gas and fertilizers globally and the extensive contribution of both Russia and Ukraine in exporting grains and oilseeds to the international markets. Hence, the Ukraine-Russia conflict has resulted in a shortage of crops and grains in the food market, especially in Europe, causing speculations if these resources should still be used for biofuel production (1st Generation). However, the International Energy Agency has warned that lowering biofuel mandates could result in rising petroleum demand and supply concerns. In light of these unfolding events, a systems thinking approach is required to monitor and analyze the implications of this crisis for food and biofuel markets as a whole to alleviate the concerns faced and plan sustainably. In this vein, based on the trade-offs between food system elements and the biofuel supply chain, as well as the potential effects of the war on the food and energy systems worldwide, a causal loop diagram is developed in the present work. According to the insights provided, the key to preventing food insecurity and keeping biofuel mandates on an increasing trend simultaneously amid the Ukraine war is to switch from the 1st Generation biofuels to higher generations. This transition would reduce not only the pressure on the food market to move toward zero hunger (SDG 2) but also pave the way to move towards a circular economy and clean and affordable energy (SDG 7) during the post-war era.",2022-06-01,2022,Zahra Shams Esfandabadi; Meisam Ranjbari; Simone Domenico Scagnelli,Edith Cowan University,Biofuel Research Journal,133,https://doi.org/10.18331/brj2022.9.2.5,Space_Aerospace,Sustainability; Biofuel; Food systems; Natural resource economics; Business,0.375
W4391617520,"Urban heat mitigation by green and blue infrastructure: Drivers, effectiveness, and future needs","The combination of urbanization and global warming leads to urban overheating and compounds the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events due to climate change. Yet, the risk of urban overheating can be mitigated by urban green-blue-grey infrastructure (GBGI), such as parks, wetlands, and engineered greening, which have the potential to effectively reduce summer air temperatures. Despite many reviews, the evidence bases on quantified GBGI cooling benefits remains partial and the practical recommendations for implementation are unclear. This systematic literature review synthesizes the evidence base for heat mitigation and related co-benefits, identifies knowledge gaps, and proposes recommendations for their implementation to maximize their benefits. After screening 27,486 papers, 202 were reviewed, based on 51 GBGI types categorized under 10 main divisions. Certain GBGI (green walls, parks, street trees) have been well researched for their urban cooling capabilities. However, several other GBGI have received negligible (zoological garden, golf course, estuary) or minimal (private garden, allotment) attention. The most efficient air cooling was observed in botanical gardens (5.0 ± 3.5°C), wetlands (4.9 ± 3.2°C), green walls (4.1 ± 4.2°C), street trees (3.8 ± 3.1°C), and vegetated balconies (3.8 ± 2.7°C). Under changing climate conditions (2070-2100) with consideration of RCP8.5, there is a shift in climate subtypes, either within the same climate zone (e.g., Dfa to Dfb and Cfb to Cfa) or across other climate zones (e.g., Dfb [continental warm-summer humid] to BSk [dry, cold semi-arid] and Cwa [temperate] to Am [tropical]). These shifts may result in lower efficiency for the current GBGI in the future. Given the importance of multiple services, it is crucial to balance their functionality, cooling performance, and other related co-benefits when planning for the future GBGI. This global GBGI heat mitigation inventory can assist policymakers and urban planners in prioritizing effective interventions to reduce the risk of urban overheating, filling research gaps, and promoting community resilience.",2024-02-07,2024,Prashant Kumar; Sisay E.

W4290700396,Nitrogen cycling and microbial cooperation in the terrestrial subsurface,"The nitrogen cycle plays a major role in aquatic nitrogen transformations, including in the terrestrial subsurface. However, the variety of transformations remains understudied. To determine how nitrogen cycling microorganisms respond to different aquifer chemistries, we sampled groundwater with varying nutrient and oxygen contents. Genes and transcripts involved in major nitrogen-cycling pathways were quantified from 55 and 26 sites, respectively, and metagenomes and metatranscriptomes were analyzed from a subset of oxic and dysoxic sites (0.3-1.1 mg/L bulk dissolved oxygen). Nitrogen-cycling mechanisms (e.g. ammonia oxidation, denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium) were prevalent and highly redundant, regardless of site-specific physicochemistry or nitrate availability, and present in 40% of reconstructed genomes, suggesting that nitrogen cycling is a core function of aquifer communities. Transcriptional activity for nitrification, denitrification, nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) occurred simultaneously in oxic and dysoxic groundwater, indicating the availability of oxic-anoxic interfaces. Concurrent activity by these microorganisms indicates potential synergisms through metabolite exchange across these interfaces (e.g. nitrite and oxygen). Fragmented denitrification pathway encoding and transcription was widespread among groundwater bacteria, although a considerable proportion of associated transcriptional activity was driven by complete denitrifiers, especially under dysoxic conditions. Despite large differences in transcription, the capacity for the final steps of denitrification was largely invariant to aquifer conditions, and most genes and transcripts encoding N2O reductases were the atypical Sec-dependant type, suggesting energy-efficiency prioritization. Results provide insights into the capacity for cooperative relationships in groundwater communities, and the richness and complexity of metabolic mechanisms leading to the loss of fixed nitrogen.",2022-08-08,2022,Olivia E.

W4298110875,A Review of Spectral Indices for Mangrove Remote Sensing,"Mangrove ecosystems provide critical goods and ecosystem services to coastal communities and contribute to climate change mitigation. Over four decades, remote sensing has proved its usefulness in monitoring mangrove ecosystems on a broad scale, over time, and at a lower cost than field observation. The increasing use of spectral indices has led to an expansion of the geographical context of mangrove studies from local-scale studies to intercontinental and global analyses over the past 20 years. In remote sensing, numerous spectral indices derived from multiple spectral bands of remotely sensed data have been developed and used for multiple studies on mangroves. In this paper, we review the range of spectral indices produced and utilised in mangrove remote sensing between 1996 and 2021. Our findings reveal that spectral indices have been used for a variety of mangrove aspects but excluded identification of mangrove species. The included aspects are mangrove extent, distribution, mangrove above ground parameters (e.g., carbon density, biomass, canopy height, and estimations of LAI), and changes to the aforementioned aspects over time. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was found to be the most widely applied index in mangroves, used in 82% of the studies reviewed, followed by the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) used in 28% of the studies. Development and application of potential indices for mangrove cover characterisation has increased (currently 6 indices are published), but NDVI remains the most popular index for mangrove remote sensing. Ultimately, we identify the limitations and gaps of current studies and suggest some future directions under the topic of spectral index application in connection to time series imagery and the fusion of optical sensors for mangrove studies in the digital era.",2022-09-29,2022,Thuong V.

It's the key issue that how to use environmental regulations to promote the orderly pollution-intensive industries transfer and the optimization of industrial structure to realize the construction of ecological civilization during the transformation and upgrading of economic. By constructing the index of environmental regulation and industry transfer, this paper analyzed the spatial-temporal change of pollution-intensive industry transfer. We collected panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2004 to 2016 and studied the spatial differences of pollution-intensive industry transfer from the perspective of environmental regulation. This paper studied the path and mechanism of environmental regulation on the pollution-intensive industry transfer theoretically and empirically with System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) model. The conclusions are as follows: Firstly, the pollution-intensive industry transfer in China shows a general trend from the east to the central and western regions. Secondly, there are obvious differences in environmental regulation between different regions. Thirdly, there are some differences in the impact of environmental regulation on industrial transfer. Therefore, the central and western regions should coordinate economic development and environmental protection when undertaking industrial transfer from the east, to optimize and upgrade industrial structure, and promote long-term economic development.",2021-06-28,2021,Shuke Fu; Zhuo Ma; Bing Ni; Jiachao Peng; Lijing Zhang,Macquarie University,Ecological Indicators,127,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107921,Space_Aerospace,China; Environmental pollution; Pollution; Business; Natural resource economics,0.15
W3119813001,Communicating Scientific Uncertainty in an Age of COVID-19: An Investigation into the Use of Preprints by Digital Media Outlets,"In this article, we investigate the surge in use of COVID-19-related preprints by media outlets. Journalists are a main source of reliable public health information during crises and, until recently, journalists have been reluctant to cover preprints because of the associated scientific uncertainty. Yet, uploads of COVID-19 preprints and their uptake by online media have outstripped that of preprints about any other topic. Using an innovative approach combining altmetrics methods with content analysis, we identified a diversity of outlets covering COVID-19-related preprints during the early months of the pandemic, including specialist medical news outlets, traditional news media outlets, and aggregators. We found a ubiquity of hyperlinks as citations and a multiplicity of framing devices for highlighting the scientific uncertainty associated with COVID-19 preprints. These devices were rarely used consistently (e.g., mentioning that the study was a preprint, unreviewed, preliminary, and/or in need of verification). About half of the stories we analyzed contained framing devices emphasizing uncertainty. Outlets in our sample were much less likely to identify the research they mentioned as preprint research, compared to identifying it as simply ""research."" This work has significant implications for public health communication within the changing media landscape. While current best practices in public health risk communication promote identifying and promoting trustworthy sources of information, the uptake of preprint research by online media presents new challenges. At the same time, it provides new opportunities for fostering greater awareness of the scientific uncertainty associated with health research findings.",2021-01-03,2021,Alice Fleerackers; Michelle Riedlinger; Laura Moorhead; Rukhsana Ahmed; Juan Pablo Alperín,Queensland University of Technology,Health Communication,126,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1864892,Space_Aerospace,Preprint; Upload; Altmetrics; Digital media; Framing (construction),0.225

W3186182384,Removing Raindrops and Rain Streaks in One Go,"Existing rain-removal algorithms often tackle either rain streak removal or raindrop removal, and thus may fail to handle real-world rainy scenes. Besides, the lack of real-world deraining datasets comprising different types of rain and their corresponding rain-free ground-truth also impedes deraining algorithm development. In this paper, we aim to address real-world deraining problems from two aspects. First, we propose a complementary cascaded network architecture, namely CCN, to remove rain streaks and raindrops in a unified framework. Specifically, our CCN removes raindrops and rain streaks in a complementary fashion, i.e., raindrop removal followed by rain streak removal and vice versa, and then fuses the results via an attention based fusion module. Considering significant shape and structure differences between rain streaks and raindrops, it is difficult to manually design a sophisticated network to remove them effectively. Thus, we employ neural architecture search to adaptively find optimal architectures within our specified deraining search space. Second, we present a new real-world rain dataset, namely RainDS, to prosper the development of deraining algorithms in practical scenarios. RainDS consists of rain images in different types and their corresponding rain-free ground-truth, including rain streak only, raindrop only, and both of them. Extensive experimental results on both existing benchmarks and RainDS demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art.",2021-06-01,2021,Ruijie Quan; Xin Yu; Yuanzhi Liang; Yi Yang,University of Technology Sydney,2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),124,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr46437.2021.00903,Space_Aerospace,Streak; Computer science; Architecture; Meteorology; Artificial intelligence,0.358
W4210434817,Explainable depression detection with multi-aspect features using a hybrid deep learning model on social media,"The ability to explain why the model produced results in such a way is an important problem, especially in the medical domain. Model explainability is important for building trust by providing insight into the model prediction. However, most existing machine learning methods provide no explainability, which is worrying. For instance, in the task of automatic depression prediction, most machine learning models lead to predictions that are obscure to humans. In this work, we propose explainable Multi-Aspect Depression Detection with Hierarchical Attention Network MDHAN, for automatic detection of depressed users on social media and explain the model prediction. We have considered user posts augmented with additional features from Twitter. Specifically, we encode user posts using two levels of attention mechanisms applied at the tweet-level and word-level, calculate each tweet and words' importance, and capture semantic sequence features from the user timelines (posts). Our hierarchical attention model is developed in such a way that it can capture patterns that leads to explainable results. Our experiments show that MDHAN outperforms several popular and robust baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining deep learning with multi-aspect features. We also show that our model helps improve predictive performance when detecting depression in users who are posting messages publicly on social media. MDHAN achieves excellent performance and ensures adequate evidence to explain the prediction.",2022-01-01,2022,Hamad Zogan; Imran Razzak; Xianzhi Wang; Shoaib Jameel; Guandong Xu,University of Technology Sydney,World Wide Web,120,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11280-021-00992-2,Space_Aerospace,Computer science; Timeline; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Social media,0.15

Accordingly, there is an urgent need to robustly quantify the pollution situation and potential sources of plastics in soils. China as the leading producer and user of agricultural plastics is analyzed as a typical case study to highlight the current situation of farmland macro-plastics and MPs. Our study summarized information on the occurrence and abundance of macro-plastics and MPs in Chinese farmland soils for the first time based on 163 publications with 728 sample sites. The results showed that the average concentration of macro-plastics, and the abundance of MPs in Chinese farmlands were 103 kg ha−1 and 4537 items kg−1 (dry soil), respectively. In addition, this study synthesized the latest scientific evidence on sources of macro-plastics and MPs in farmland soils. Agricultural plastic films and organic wastes are the most reported sources, indicating that they contribute significantly to plastic debris in agricultural soils. Furthermore, the modeling methods for quantifying macro-plastics and MPs in soils and estimating the stock and flow of plastic materials within agricultural systems were also summarized.Keywords: Abundancefarmland soilsmacro-plasticsmicroplasticsquantitative methodsource apportionmentHANDLING EDITORS: Hyunjung Kim and Jörg Rinklebe Disclosure statementThe authors report there are no competing interests to declare.Additional informationFundingThis research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant [number 42277097]; the UKRI Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) and the Natural Environment Research Council project, ""Do agricultural microplastics undermine food security and sustainable development in less economically developed countries?"" under Grant [NE/V005871/1]; the International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant [NSFC-UNEP: 32261143459], and the High-level Team Project of China Agricultural University.",2023-09-23,2023,Siyang Ren; Kai Wang; Jinrui Zhang; Jinɡjinɡ Li; Hanyue Zhang,Murdoch University,Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology,120,https://doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2023.2259275,Space_Aerospace,Microplastics; Environmental science; Macro; Pollution; China,0.3
W3121969390,The Drone Revolution of Shark Science: A Review,"Over the past decade, drones have become a popular tool for wildlife management and research. Drones have shown significant value for animals that were often difficult or dangerous to study using traditional survey methods. In the past five years drone technology has become commonplace for shark research with their use above, and more recently, below the water helping to minimise knowledge gaps about these cryptic species. Drones have enhanced our understanding of shark behaviour and are critically important tools, not only due to the importance and conservation of the animals in the ecosystem, but to also help minimise dangerous encounters with humans. To provide some guidance for their future use in relation to sharks, this review provides an overview of how drones are currently used with critical context for shark monitoring. We show how drones have been used to fill knowledge gaps around fundamental shark behaviours or movements, social interactions, and predation across multiple species and scenarios. We further detail the advancement in technology across sensors, automation, and artificial intelligence that are improving our abilities in data collection and analysis and opening opportunities for shark-related beach safety.

This article presents a large-scale cerebellar network model for supervised learning, as well as a cerebellum-inspired neuromorphic architecture to map the cerebellar anatomical structure into the large-scale model. Our multinucleus model and its underpinning architecture contain approximately 3.5 million neurons, upscaling state-of-the-art neuromorphic designs by over 34 times. Besides, the proposed model and architecture incorporate 3411k granule cells, introducing a 284 times increase compared to a previous study including only 12k cells. This large scaling induces more biologically plausible cerebellar divergence/convergence ratios, which results in better mimicking biology. In order to verify the functionality of our proposed model and demonstrate its strong biomimicry, a reconfigurable neuromorphic system is used, on which our developed architecture is realized to replicate cerebellar dynamics during the optokinetic response. In addition, our neuromorphic architecture is used to analyze the dynamical synchronization within the Purkinje cells, revealing the effects of firing rates of mossy fibers on the resonance dynamics of Purkinje cells. Our experiments show that real-time operation can be realized, with a system throughput of up to 4.70 times larger than previous works with high synaptic event rate.

W4364379307,Remote-Sensing Data and Deep-Learning Techniques in Crop Mapping and Yield Prediction: A Systematic Review,"Reliable and timely crop-yield prediction and crop mapping are crucial for food security and decision making in the food industry and in agro-environmental management. The global coverage, rich spectral and spatial information and repetitive nature of remote sensing (RS) data have made them effective tools for mapping crop extent and predicting yield before harvesting. Advanced machine-learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL), can accurately represent the complex features essential for crop mapping and yield predictions by accounting for the nonlinear relationships between variables. The DL algorithm has attained remarkable success in different fields of RS and its use in crop monitoring is also increasing. Although a few reviews cover the use of DL techniques in broader RS and agricultural applications, only a small number of references are made to RS-based crop-mapping and yield-prediction studies. A few recently conducted reviews attempted to provide overviews of the applications of DL in crop-yield prediction. However, they did not cover crop mapping and did not consider some of the critical attributes that reveal the essential issues in the field. This study is one of the first in the literature to provide a thorough systematic review of the important scientific works related to state-of-the-art DL techniques and RS in crop mapping and yield estimation. This review systematically identified 90 papers from databases of peer-reviewed scientific publications and comprehensively reviewed the aspects related to the employed platforms, sensors, input features, architectures, frameworks, training data, spatial distributions of study sites, output scales, evaluation metrics and performances. The review suggests that multiple DL-based solutions using different RS data and DL architectures have been developed in recent years, thereby providing reliable solutions for crop mapping and yield prediction. However, challenges related to scarce training data, the development of effective, efficient and generalisable models and the transparency of predictions should be addressed to implement these solutions at scale for diverse locations and crops.",2023-04-11,2023,Abhasha Joshi; Biswajeet Pradhan; Shilpa Gite; Subrata Chakraborty,University of Technology Sydney,Remote Sensing,108,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15082014,Space_Aerospace,Computer science; Crop yield; Field (mathematics); Yield (engineering); Food security,0.583
W4221025418,Effects of sustainable agricultural practices on farm income and food security in northern Ghana,"Abstract The adoption of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) has been recommended by many experts and international institutions to address food security and climate change problems. Global support for the Sustainable Development Goals has focused attention on efforts to up-scale the adoption of SAPs in developing countries where growth in populations and incomes compromises the resilience of natural resources. This study investigates the factors affecting smallholder farmers’ decisions to adopt SAPs (improved seed, fertilizer, and soil and water conservation) and the impacts of the adoption on farm income and food security, using data collected from Ghana. Food security is captured by the reduced coping strategy index and household dietary diversity. The multinomial endogenous switching regression model is utilized to address selection bias issues. Results show that farmers’ decisions to adopt SAPs are influenced by the social demographics of the households, plot-level characteristics, extension services and locations.

W4291019062,The role of inputs of marine wrack and carrion in sandy‐beach ecosystems: a global review,"ABSTRACT Sandy beaches are iconic interfaces that functionally link the ocean with the land via the flow of organic matter from the sea. These cross‐ecosystem fluxes often comprise uprooted seagrass and dislodged macroalgae that can form substantial accumulations of detritus, termed ‘wrack’, on sandy beaches. In addition, the tissue of the carcasses of marine animals that regularly wash up on beaches form a rich food source (‘carrion’) for a diversity of scavenging animals. Here, we provide a global review of how wrack and carrion provide spatial subsidies that shape the structure and functioning of sandy‐beach ecosystems (sandy beaches and adjacent surf zones), which typically have little in situ primary production. We also examine the spatial scaling of the influence of these processes across the broader land‐ and seascape, and identify key gaps in our knowledge to guide future research directions and priorities. Large quantities of detrital kelp and seagrass can flow into sandy‐beach ecosystems, where microbial decomposers and animals process it. The rates of wrack supply and its retention are influenced by the oceanographic processes that transport it, the geomorphology and landscape context of the recipient beaches, and the condition, life history and morphological characteristics of the macrophyte taxa that are the ultimate source of wrack. When retained in beach ecosystems, wrack often creates hotspots of microbial metabolism, secondary productivity, biodiversity, and nutrient remineralization. Nutrients are produced during wrack breakdown, and these can return to coastal waters in surface flows (swash) and aquifers discharging into the subtidal surf. Beach‐cast kelp often plays a key trophic role, being an abundant and preferred food source for mobile, semi‐aquatic invertebrates that channel imported algal matter to predatory invertebrates, fish, and birds. The role of beach‐cast marine carrion is likely to be underestimated, as it can be consumed rapidly by highly mobile scavengers (e.g. foxes, coyotes, raptors, vultures). These consumers become important vectors in transferring marine productivity inland, thereby linking marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Whilst deposits of organic matter on sandy‐beach ecosystems underpin a range of ecosystem functions and services, they can be at variance with aesthetic perceptions resulting in widespread activities, such as ‘beach cleaning and grooming’. This practice diminishes the energetic base of food webs, intertidal fauna, and biodiversity. Global declines in seagrass beds and kelp forests (linked to global warming) are predicted to cause substantial reductions in the amounts of marine organic matter reaching many beach ecosystems, likely causing flow‐on effects for food webs and biodiversity. Similarly, future sea‐level rise and increased storm frequency are likely to alter profoundly the physical attributes of beaches, which in turn can change the rates at which beaches retain and process the influxes of wrack and animal carcasses. Conservation of the multi‐faceted ecosystem services that sandy beaches provide will increasingly need to encompass a greater societal appreciation and the safeguarding of ecological functions reliant on beach‐cast organic matter on innumerable ocean shores worldwide.",2022-08-11,2022,Glenn A.

W4379744422,Does stakeholder participation improve environmental governance? Evidence from a meta-analysis of 305 case studies,"Participation and collaboration of citizens and organized stakeholders in public decision-making is widely believed to improve environmental governance outputs. However, empirical evidence on the benefits of participatory governance is largely scattered across small-N case studies. To synthesize the available case-based evidence, we conducted a broad case-based meta-analysis across 22 Western democracies, including 305 individual cases of public environmental decision-making. We asked: How do 'more' participatory decision-making processes compare against 'less' participatory ones in fostering - or hindering - strong environmental governance outputs, (i.e. environmental provisions in plans, agreements or permits)? Which design features make a difference? What role does the decision-making context play? How do results change if we control for the intentions of the leading governmental agency? To capture the central design features of decision-making processes, we distinguish three dimensions of participation: the intensity of communication among participants and process organizers; the extent to which participants can shape decisions (""power delegation""); and the extent to which different stakeholder groups are represented. Our regression analysis yields robust evidence that these three design features of participation impact upon the environmental standard of governance outputs, even when controlling for the goals of governmental agencies. Power delegation is shown to be the most stable predictor of strong environmental outputs. However, communication intensity only predicts the conservation-related standard of outputs, but not the environmental health-related standard of outputs. Participants' environmental stance was another strong predictor, with considerable variation across different contexts. While our results remain broadly stable across a wide range of contexts, certain contextual conditions stood out in shaping the relation between participation and environmental outputs. Overall, our findings can inform the design of participatory processes that deliver governance outputs of a high environmental standard.",2023-06-08,2023,Jens Newig; Nicolas W.

W4225391652,Indigenous oyster fisheries persisted for millennia and should inform future management,"Historical ecology has revolutionized our understanding of fisheries and cultural landscapes, demonstrating the value of historical data for evaluating the past, present, and future of Earth's ecosystems. Despite several important studies, Indigenous fisheries generally receive less attention from scholars and managers than the 17th-20th century capitalist commercial fisheries that decimated many keystone species, including oysters. We investigate Indigenous oyster harvest through time in North America and Australia, placing these data in the context of sea level histories and historical catch records. Indigenous oyster fisheries were pervasive across space and through time, persisting for 5000-10,000 years or more. Oysters were likely managed and sometimes ""farmed,"" and are woven into broader cultural, ritual, and social traditions. Effective stewardship of oyster reefs and other marine fisheries around the world must center Indigenous histories and include Indigenous community members to co-develop more inclusive, just, and successful strategies for restoration, harvest, and management.",2022-05-03,2022,Leslie Reeder-Myers; Todd J.

W4323362488,National CO<sub>2</sub> budgets (2015–2020) inferred from atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> observations in support of the global stocktake,"Abstract. Accurate accounting of emissions and removals of CO2 is critical for the planning and verification of emission reduction targets in support of the Paris Agreement. Here, we present a pilot dataset of country-specific net carbon exchange (NCE; fossil plus terrestrial ecosystem fluxes) and terrestrial carbon stock changes aimed at informing countries' carbon budgets. These estimates are based on “top-down” NCE outputs from the v10 Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) modeling intercomparison project (MIP), wherein an ensemble of inverse modeling groups conducted standardized experiments assimilating OCO-2 column-averaged dry-air mole fraction (XCO2) retrievals (ACOS v10), in situ CO2 measurements or combinations of these data. The v10 OCO-2 MIP NCE estimates are combined with “bottom-up” estimates of fossil fuel emissions and lateral carbon fluxes to estimate changes in terrestrial carbon stocks, which are impacted by anthropogenic and natural drivers. These flux and stock change estimates are reported annually (2015–2020) as both a global 1∘ × 1∘ gridded dataset and a country-level dataset and are available for download from the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites' (CEOS) website: https://doi.org/10.48588/npf6-sw92 (Byrne et al., 2022). Across the v10 OCO-2 MIP experiments, we obtain increases in the ensemble median terrestrial carbon stocks of 3.29–4.58 Pg CO2 yr−1 (0.90–1.25 Pg C yr−1). This is a result of broad increases in terrestrial carbon stocks across the northern extratropics, while the tropics generally have stock losses but with considerable regional variability and differences between v10 OCO-2 MIP experiments. We discuss the state of the science for tracking emissions and removals using top-down methods, including current limitations and future developments towards top-down monitoring and verification systems.",2023-03-07,2023,Brendan Byrne; D.

W4214587927,Predicting Canopy Chlorophyll Content in Sugarcane Crops Using Machine Learning Algorithms and Spectral Vegetation Indices Derived from UAV Multispectral Imagery,"The use of satellite-based Remote Sensing (RS) is a well-developed field of research. RS techniques have been successfully utilized to evaluate the chlorophyll content for the monitoring of sugarcane crops. This research provides a new framework for inferring the chlorophyll content in sugarcane crops at the canopy level using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and spectral vegetation indices processed with multiple machine learning algorithms. Studies were conducted in a sugarcane field located in Sugarcane Research Institute (SRI, Uda Walawe, Sri Lanka), with various fertilizer applications over the entire growing season from 2020 to 2021. An UAV with multispectral camera was used to collect the aerial images to generate the vegetation indices. Ground measurements of leaf chlorophyll were used as indications for fertilizer status in the sugarcane field. Different machine learning (ML) algorithms were used ground-truthing data of chlorophyll content and spectral vegetation indices to forecast sugarcane chlorophyll content. Several machine learning algorithms such as MLR, RF, DT, SVR, XGB, KNN and ANN were applied in two ways: before feature selection (BFS) by training the algorithms with all twenty-four (24) vegetation indices with five (05) spectral bands and after feature selection (AFS) by training algorithms with fifteen (15) vegetation indices. All the algorithms with both BFS and AFS methods were compared with an estimated coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Spectral indices such as RVI and DVI were shown to be the most reliable indices for estimating chlorophyll content in sugarcane fields, with coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.94 and 0.93, respectively. XGB model shows the highest validation score (R2) and lowest RMSE in both methods of BFS (0.96 and 0.14) and AFS (0.98 and 0.78), respectively. However, KNN and SVR algorithms show the lowest validation accuracy than other models. According to the results, the AFS validation score is higher than BFS in MLR, SVR, XGB and KNN. Even though, validation score of the ANN model is decreased in AFS. The findings demonstrated that the use of multispectral UAV could be utilized to estimate chlorophyll content and measure crop health status over a larger sugarcane field. This methodology will aid in real-time crop nutrition management in sugarcane plantations by reducing the need for conventional measurement of sugarcane chlorophyll content.",2022-02-25,2022,A.

W4286817043,"Floods and diarrheal morbidity: Evidence on the relationship, effect modifiers, and attributable risk from Sichuan Province, China","Although studies have provided the estimates of floods-diarrhoea associations, little is known about the lag effect, effect modification, and attributable risk. Based on Sichuan, China, an uneven socio-economic development province with plateau, basin, and mountain terrains spanning different climatic zones, we aimed to systematically examine the impacts of floods on diarrheal morbidity.We retrieved information on daily diarrheal cases, floods, meteorological variables, and annual socio-economic characteristics for 21 cities in Sichuan from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019. We fitted time-series Poisson models to estimate the city-specific floods-diarrhoea relation over the lags of 0-14 days, and then pooled them using meta-analysis for cumulative and lag effects. We further employed meta-regression to explore potential effect modifiers and identify effect modification. We calculated the attributable diarrheal cases and fraction of attributable morbidity within the framework of the distributed lag model.Floods had a significant cumulative association with diarrhoea at the provincial level, but varied by regions and cities. The effects of the floods appeared on the second day after the floods and lasted for 5 days. Floods-diarrhoea relations were modified by three effect modifiers, with stronger flood effects on diarrhoea found in areas with higher air pressure, lower diurnal temperature range, or warmer temperature. Floods were responsible for advancing a fraction of diarrhoea, corresponding to 0.25% within the study period and 0.48% within the flood season.The impacts imposed by floods were mainly distributed within the first week. The floods-diarrhoea relations varied by geographic and climatic conditions. The diarrheal burden attributable to floods is currently low in Sichuan, but this figure could increase with the exposure more intensive and the effect modifiers more detrimental in the future. Our findings are expected to provide evidence for the formulation of temporal- and spatial-specific strategies to reduce potential risks of flood-related diarrhoea.",2022-07-24,2022,Tianjiao Lan; Y.

W4281896427,The Metaverse as a Virtual Form of Data-Driven Smart Urbanism: On Post-Pandemic Governance through the Prism of the Logic of Surveillance Capitalism,"The Metaverse, as a gigantic ecosystem application enabled mainly by Artificial Intelligence (AI), the IoT, Big Data, and Extended Reality (XR) technologies, represents an idea of a hypothetical ""parallel virtual environment"" that incarnates ways of living in virtually inhabitable cities. It is increasingly seen as a transition from smart cities to virtual cities and a new target for city governments to attain “new” goals. However, the Metaverse project was launched amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a crisis purported to be a rare opportunity that should be seized to reset and reimagine the world—though mainly in regard to its digital incarnation, and what this entails in terms of both cementing and normalizing the corporate-led, top-down, technocratic, tech-mediated, algorithmic mode of governance, as well as new forms of controlling ways of living in urban society. The “new normal” has already set the stage for undemocratically resetting and unilaterally reimagining the world, resulting in an abrupt large-scale digital transformation of urban society, a process of digitization and digitalization that is in turn paving the way for a new era of merging virtuality and urbanity. This has raised serious concerns over the risks and impacts of the surveillance technologies that have been rapidly and massively deployed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. These concerns also relate to the global architecture of the computer mediation of the Metaverse upon which the logic of surveillance capitalism depends, and which is constituted by control and commodification mechanisms that seek to monitor, predict, control, and trade the behavior of human users, as well as to exile them from their own. This viewpoint paper explores and questions the Metaverse from the prism of the social and economic logic of surveillance capitalism, focusing on how and why the practices of the post-pandemic governance of urban society are bound to be undemocratic and unethical. The novelty of the viewpoint lies in providing new insights into understanding the dark side of the ostensible fancier successor of the Internet of today, thereby its value and contribution to the ongoing scholarly debates in the field of Science, Technology, and Society (STS). In addition, by shedding light on the emergence of the Metaverse as a computing platform, the viewpoint seeks to help policymakers understand and assess the ramifications of its wide adoption, as well as to help users make informed decisions about its usage in everyday activity—if it actualizes.",2022-05-31,2022,Simon Elias Bibri; Zaheer Allam,Deakin University,Smart Cities,96,https://doi.org/10.3390/smartcities5020037,Space_Aerospace,Metaverse; Technocracy; Corporate governance; Bricolage; Capitalism,0.583
W4211244415,What are the real environmental impacts of Antarctic tourism? Unveiling their importance through a comprehensive meta-analysis,"Human activities in Antarctica were increasing before the COVID-19 pandemic, and tourism was not an exception. The growth and diversification of Antarctic tourism over the last few decades have been extensively studied. However, environmental impacts associated with this activity have received less attention despite an increasing body of scholarship examining environmental issues related to Antarctic tourism. Aside from raising important research questions, the potential negative effects of tourist visits in Antarctica are also an issue discussed by Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties. This study presents the results of a meta-analysis of scholarly publications that synthesizes and updates our current knowledge of environmental impacts resulting from Antarctic tourism. A first publication database containing 233 records that focussed on this topic was compiled and subjected to a general bibliometric and content analysis. Further, an in-depth content analysis was performed on a subset of 75 records, which were focussed on showing specific research on Antarctic tourism impacts. The main topic, methods, management proposals, and research gaps highlighted by the respective authors of these 75 publications were assessed. The range of research topics addressed, the methods used – including the application of established research designs from the field of environmental impact assessment –, and the conclusions reached by the study authors are discussed. Interestingly, almost one third of the studies did not detect a direct relationship between tourism and significant negative effects on the environment. Cumulative impacts of tourism have received little attention, and long-term and comprehensive monitoring programs have been discussed only rarely, leading us to assume that such long-term programs are scarce. More importantly, connections between research and policy or management do not always exist. This analysis highlights the need for a comprehensive strategy to investigate and monitor the environmental impacts of tourism in Antarctica. A first specific research and monitoring programme to stimulate a debate among members of the Antarctic scientific and policy communities is proposed, with the ultimate goal of advancing the regulation and management of Antarctic tourism collaboratively.",2022-02-09,2022,Pablo Tejedo; Javier Benayas del Álamo; Daniela Cajiao; Yu‐Fai Leung; Daniela De Filippo,University of Canterbury,Journal of Environmental Management,95,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114634,Space_Aerospace,Tourism; Antarctic treaty; Scholarship; Diversification (marketing strategy); Environmental impact assessment,0.15
W4224099165,Land use for bioenergy: Synergies and trade-offs between sustainable development goals,"Bioenergy aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contribute to meeting global climate change mitigation targets. Nevertheless, several sustainability concerns are associated with bioenergy, especially related to the impacts of using land for dedicated energy crop production. Cultivating energy crops can result in synergies or trade-offs between GHG emission reductions and other sustainability effects depending on context-specific conditions. Using the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework, the main synergies and trade-offs associated with land use for dedicated energy crop production were identified. Furthermore, the context-specific conditions (i.e., biomass feedstock, previous land use, climate, soil type and agricultural management) which affect those synergies and trade-offs were also identified. The most recent literature was reviewed and a pairwise comparison between GHG emission reduction (SDG 13) and other SDGs was carried out. A total of 427 observations were classified as either synergy (170), trade-off (176), or no effect (81). Most synergies with environmentally-related SDGs, such as water quality and biodiversity conservation, were observed when perennial crops were produced on arable land, pasture or marginal land in the ‘cool temperate moist’ climate zone and ‘high activity clay’ soils. Most trade-offs were related to food security and water availability. Previous land use and feedstock type are more impactful in determining synergies and trade-offs than climatic zone and soil type. This study highlights the importance of considering context-specific conditions in evaluating synergies and trade-offs and their relevance for developing appropriate policies and practices to meet worldwide demand for bioenergy in a sustainable manner.",2022-04-07,2022,Ivan Vera; Birka Wicke; Patrick Lamers; Annette Cowie; Anna Repo,University of New England,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,89,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2022.112409,Space_Aerospace,Sustainability; Greenhouse gas; Bioenergy; Context (archaeology); Environmental science,0.375
W4310155624,Mapping the planet’s critical natural assets,"Abstract Sustaining the organisms, ecosystems and processes that underpin human wellbeing is necessary to achieve sustainable development. Here we define critical natural assets as the natural and semi-natural ecosystems that provide 90% of the total current magnitude of 14 types of nature’s contributions to people (NCP), and we map the global locations of these critical natural assets at 2 km resolution. Critical natural assets for maintaining local-scale NCP (12 of the 14 NCP) account for 30% of total global land area and 24% of national territorial waters, while 44% of land area is required to also maintain two global-scale NCP (carbon storage and moisture recycling). These areas overlap substantially with cultural diversity (areas containing 96% of global languages) and biodiversity (covering area requirements for 73% of birds and 66% of mammals). At least 87% of the world’s population live in the areas benefitting from critical natural assets for local-scale NCP, while only 16% live on the lands containing these assets. Many of the NCP mapped here are left out of international agreements focused on conserving species or mitigating climate change, yet this analysis shows that explicitly prioritizing critical natural assets and the NCP they provide could simultaneously advance development, climate and conservation goals.",2022-11-28,2022,Rebecca Chaplin‐Kramer; Rachel Neugarten; Richard Sharp; Pamela Collins; Stephen Polasky,University of Tasmania,Nature Ecology & Evolution,86,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-022-01934-5,Space_Aerospace,Biodiversity; Environmental resource management; Natural (archaeology); Ecosystem services; Ecosystem,0.225
W4386519854,"Waste-derived nanobiochar: A new avenue towards sustainable agriculture, environment, and circular bioeconomy","The greatest challenge for the agriculture sector in the twenty-first century is to increase agricultural production to feed the burgeoning global population while maintaining soil health and the integrity of the agroecosystem. Currently, the application of biochar is widely implemented as an effective means for boosting sustainable agriculture while having a negligible influence on ecosystems and the environment. In comparison to traditional biochar, nano-biochar (nano-BC) boasts enhanced specific surface area, adsorption capacity, and mobility properties within soil, allowing it to promote soil properties, crop growth, and environmental remediation. Additionally, carbon sequestration and reduction of methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture can be achieved with nano-BC applications, contributing to climate change mitigation. Nonetheless, due to cost-effectiveness, sustainability, and environmental friendliness, waste-derived nano-BC may emerge as the most viable alternative to conventional waste management strategies, contributing to the circular bioeconomy and the broader goal of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, it's important to note that research on nano-BC is still in its nascent stages. Potential risks, including toxicity in aquatic and terrestrial environments, necessitate extensive field investigations. This review delineates the potential of waste-derived nano-BC for sustainable agriculture and environmental applications, outlining current advancements, challenges, and possibilities in the realms from a sustainability and circular bioeconomy standpoint.",2023-09-07,2023,Md.

W4224111564,Computer vision and deep learning for fish classification in underwater habitats: A survey,"Abstract Marine scientists use remote underwater image and video recording to survey fish species in their natural habitats. This helps them get a step closer towards understanding and predicting how fish respond to climate change, habitat degradation and fishing pressure. This information is essential for developing sustainable fisheries for human consumption, and for preserving the environment. However, the enormous volume of collected videos makes extracting useful information a daunting and time‐consuming task for a human being. A promising method to address this problem is the cutting‐edge deep learning (DL) technology. DL can help marine scientists parse large volumes of video promptly and efficiently, unlocking niche information that cannot be obtained using conventional manual monitoring methods. In this paper, we first provide a survey of computer visions (CVs) and DL studies conducted between 2003 and 2021 on fish classification in underwater habitats. We then give an overview of the key concepts of DL, while analysing and synthesizing DL studies. We also discuss the main challenges faced when developing DL for underwater image processing and propose approaches to address them. Finally, we provide insights into the marine habitat monitoring research domain and shed light on what the future of DL for underwater image processing may hold. This paper aims to inform marine scientists who would like to gain a high‐level understanding of essential DL concepts and survey state‐of‐the‐art DL‐based fish classification in their underwater habitat.",2022-04-15,2022,Alzayat Saleh; Marcus Sheaves; Mostafa Rahimi Azghadi,James Cook University,Fish and Fisheries,81,https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12666,Space_Aerospace,Underwater; Computer science; Habitat; Marine habitats; Fishing,0.225

Once confined to the realm of science fiction and small-scale technological experiments, AI is now all around us, in the shape of urban artificial intelligences including autonomous cars, robots, city brains and urban software agents. The aim of this article is to critically examine the nature of urbanism in the emergent age of AI. More specifically, we shed light on how urban AI is impacting the development of cities, and argue that an urbanism influenced by AI, which we term AI urbanism, differs in theory and practice from smart urbanism. In the future, the rise of a post-smart urbanism driven by AI has the potential to form autonomous cities that transcend, theoretically and empirically, traditional smart cities.

W4322580305,Introduction to the Special Issue of “TikTok and Social Movements”,"This Special Issue of “TikTok and Social Movements” emerges from an attempt to map out the landscape of social movements happening on TikTok, drawing from the online symposium “TikTok and Social Movements” hosted in September 2021 by the TikTok Cultures Research Network, a research portal for interdisciplinary scholarship on TikTok cultures. The recent growing popularity of TikTok has transformed the cultures and practices of social movements worldwide. Through the platform’s participatory affordances, many users find meaningful ways to engage with the platform and its cultures, by leading and participating in a variety of activist initiatives for global awareness, social change, and civic politics. Within this context, this introduction to the Special Issue titled “TikTok and Social Movements” begins by thinking about how social media pop cultures have served as a vehicle for mobilizing and engaging in social movements for social (in)justice and politics in the era of social media. By situating TikTok, a nascent platform and culture of short video, within the ongoing discussion of digitally mobilized movements and social justice, this introduction addresses several crucial points to consider when discussing TikTok cultures and social movements that are happening or interrupted on the platform. These points are interrogated with more details and cultural contexts in the five case studies and three expert commentaries in this Special Issue. Specifically, the collection of papers interrogate how TikTok’s interactive and creative affordances have augmented and altered our cultures, practices, politics, and power dynamics of engaging with publics for various beliefs and social agendas.",2023-01-01,2023,Jin Lee; Crystal Abidin,Curtin University,Social Media + Society,71,https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051231157452,Space_Aerospace,Social movement; Social media; Affordance; Sociology; Popularity,0.225
W4386020824,Challenges and opportunities for grassland restoration: A global perspective of best practices in the era of climate change,"Grasslands are ubiquitous globally, and their conservation and restoration are critical to combat both the biodiversity and climate crises. There is increasing interest in implementing effective multifunctional grassland restoration to restore biodiversity concomitant with above- and belowground carbon sequestration, delivery of carbon credits and/or integration with land dedicated to solar panels. Other common multifunctional restoration considerations include improved forage value, erosion control, water management, pollinator services, and wildlife habitat provisioning. In addition, many grasslands are global biodiversity hotspots. Nonetheless, relative to their impact, and as compared to forests, the importance of preservation, conservation, and restoration of grasslands has been widely overlooked due to their subtle physiognomy and underappreciated contributions to human and planetary well-being. Ultimately, the global success of carbon sequestration will depend on more complete and effective grassland ecosystem restoration. In this review, supported by examples from across the Western world, we call for more strenuous and unified development of best practices for grassland restoration in three areas of concern: initial site conditions and site preparation; implementation of restoration measures and management; and social context and sustainability. For each area, we identify the primary challenges to grassland restoration and highlight case studies with proven results to derive successful and generalizable solutions.",2023-08-22,2023,Kelly G.

W4321020071,How to measure light pollution—A systematic review of methods and applications,"Artificial light at night (ALAN) is ever-present in modern society and has revolutionised our lives. Along with its many benefits, ALAN can have adverse effects that are studied across many fields, including astronomy, epidemiology, and ecology. This paper collates multi-disciplinary knowledge on measuring light pollution through a systematic review of 140 articles. The measurement tools used in each context are comprehensively discussed, gaps are identified in current techniques, and benchmarking information is provided to aid future research. It is found that no single device meets all measurement objectives, and opportunities exist for further development, such as refining low-cost imaging tools. The paper highlights that each tool's limitations must be acknowledged to avoid incorrect conclusions. Thorough experimental reporting, including details on instrument location and aiming, is also essential for the replication of research. Collaboration is needed to develop unified measurement techniques, units and terminologies rather than maintaining disciplinary silos. This will enable light measurement to keep pace with lighting technologies and the growing effects of light pollution.",2023-02-17,2023,Susan Mander; Fakhrul Alam; Ruggiero Lovreglio; Melanie Po‐Leen Ooi,Massey University,Sustainable Cities and Society,65,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2023.104465,Space_Aerospace,Context (archaeology); Light pollution; Pace; Benchmarking; Computer science,0.15
W4386378690,"Global Burden of Lumpy Skin Disease, Outbreaks, and Future Challenges","Lumpy skin disease (LSD), a current global concern, causes economic devastation in livestock industries, with cattle and water buffalo reported to have higher morbidity and lower mortality rates. LSD is caused by lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), a member of the Poxviridae family. It is an enzootic, rapidly explorative and sometimes fatal infection, characterized by multiple raised nodules on the skin of infected animals. It was first reported in Zambia in 1929 and is considered endemic in Africa south of the Sahara desert. It has gradually spread beyond Africa into the Middle East, with periodic occurrences in Asian and East European countries. Recently, it has been spreading in most Asian countries including far East Asia and threatens incursion to LSD-free countries. Rapid and accurate diagnostic capabilities, virus identification, vaccine development, vector control, regional and international collaborations and effective biosecurity policies are important for the control, prevention, and eradication of LSD infections. This review critically evaluates the global burden of LSD, the chronological historical outbreaks of LSD, and future directions for collaborative global actions.",2023-08-31,2023,Mahfuza Akther; S Akter; Subir Sarker; Joshua W.

W4389289181,Record-high Antarctic Peninsula temperatures and surface melt in February 2022: a compound event with an intense atmospheric river,"Abstract The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) experienced a new extreme warm event and record-high surface melt in February 2022, rivaling the recent temperature records from 2015 and 2020, and contributing to the alarming series of extreme warm events over this region showing stronger warming compared to the rest of Antarctica. Here, the drivers and impacts of the event are analyzed in detail using a range of observational and modeling data. The northern/northwestern AP was directly impacted by an intense atmospheric river (AR) attaining category 3 on the AR scale, which brought anomalous heat and rainfall, while the AR-enhanced foehn effect further warmed its northeastern side. The event was triggered by multiple large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns linking the AR formation to tropical convection anomalies and stationary Rossby waves, with an anomalous Amundsen Sea Low and a record-breaking high-pressure system east of the AP. This multivariate and spatial compound event culminated in widespread and intense surface melt across the AP. Circulation analog analysis shows that global warming played a role in the amplification and increased probability of the event. Increasing frequency of such events can undermine the stability of the AP ice shelves, with multiple local to global impacts, including acceleration of the AP ice mass loss and changes in sensitive ecosystems.",2023-12-04,2023,Irina Gorodetskaya; Claudio Durán-Alarcón; Sergi González; Kyle R.

We document abnormal returns, volatility and volume reactions to climate policy events among green stocks. However, the magnitude of the reactions varies between the tightening and loosening of climate policy and across subgroups of the green stock markets. Our connectedness analysis further investigates the spillover patterns among individual green stocks and confirms their heterogeneous natures when responding to the occurrence of these climate policy events.

W4317036758,Market reaction to the Russian Ukrainian war: a global analysis of the banking industry,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the market reactions of the banking industry to the Russian–Ukraine war. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses an event study methodology, regression analyses and interaction effects to study the effect of the war on banks stock prices and analyze factors that explain the cumulative abnormal return. Findings First, this study finds a significant decline of almost 1.5% in return on the war date. Similar patterns were observed for all continents, but Europe had the most severe drop of about 4%. Second, after excluding the contemporaneous influence of the whole market using the market model, global bank equities returns fell by about 1% on the war date, indicating that bank stocks were more severely impacted by the war than the average stock market. Net-of-market return approach further reveals that bank stock prices decreased 1.4% more on the event day compared to the prewar market average. Third, the impacts of the war and sanctions were persistent when the war continued. Banks stocks were most hit in Europe, Asia and North America. Originality/value This paper pioneers the study of the effect of the Russia–Ukraine war on the banking industry.

W4386324994,A Review on UAV-Based Applications for Plant Disease Detection and Monitoring,"Remote sensing technology is vital for precision agriculture, aiding in early issue detection, resource management, and environmentally friendly practices. Recent advances in remote sensing technology and data processing have propelled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into valuable tools for obtaining detailed data on plant diseases with high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution. Given the growing body of scholarly research centered on UAV-based disease detection, a comprehensive review and analysis of current studies becomes imperative to provide a panoramic view of evolving methodologies in plant disease monitoring and to strategically evaluate the potential and limitations of such strategies. This study undertakes a systematic quantitative literature review to summarize existing literature and discern current research trends in UAV-based applications for plant disease detection and monitoring. Results reveal a global disparity in research on the topic, with Asian countries being the top contributing countries (43 out of 103 papers). World regions such as Oceania and Africa exhibit comparatively lesser representation. To date, research has largely focused on diseases affecting wheat, sugar beet, potato, maize, and grapevine. Multispectral, reg-green-blue, and hyperspectral sensors were most often used to detect and identify disease symptoms, with current trends pointing to approaches integrating multiple sensors and the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques. Future research should prioritize (i) development of cost-effective and user-friendly UAVs, (ii) integration with emerging agricultural technologies, (iii) improved data acquisition and processing efficiency (iv) diverse testing scenarios, and (v) ethical considerations through proper regulations.",2023-08-31,2023,Louis Kouadio; Moussa El Jarroudi; Zineb Belabess; Salah‐Eddine Laasli; Md Zohurul Kadir Roni,University of Southern Queensland,Remote Sensing,59,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15174273,Space_Aerospace,Hyperspectral imaging; Computer science; Precision agriculture; Plant disease; Multispectral image,0.433
W4380927629,Determinants of continuance intention to use food delivery apps: findings from PLS and fsQCA,"Purpose Customers increasingly use food delivery applications (FDAs) to place orders. Despite the popularity of FDAs, limited research has investigated the drivers of the continuance intention to use FDAs. This study aims to uncover the drivers of the continuance intention to use FDAs by integrating the “technology continuance theory” (TCT) with perceived task-technology fit, perceived value and perceived food safety. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 398 individuals in Thailand and evaluated using “partial least squares” (PLS) and “fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis” (fsQCA). Findings The PLS results supported the significance of all direct relationships, except the effects of perceived ease of use on attitude and perceived usefulness on continuance intention. Accordingly, perceived food safety positively moderated the impact of perceived ease of use on attitudes. The fsQCA uncovered seven solutions with various combinations of factors that predicted high continuance intention. Practical implications This study enables food delivery apps to develop effective strategies for retaining users and sustaining financial performance. Originality/value This research contributes to the literature by investigating the factors underlying the continuous use of FDAs with a new PLS-fsQCA technique and applying TCT in a new technological context, FDAs and enriching it by adding three variables: perceived task-technology fit, perceived value and perceived food safety.",2023-06-16,2023,Behzad Foroughi; Elaheh Yadegaridehkordi; Mohammad Iranmanesh; Teerachart Sukcharoen; Morteza Ghobakhlo,Edith Cowan University,International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management,57,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijchm-10-2022-1209,Space_Aerospace,Continuance; Qualitative comparative analysis; Psychology; Usability; Context (archaeology),0.3

These places of local and global socio-ecological importance face significant threats from industrial development expansion, but the risk of conversion of these lands remains unclear. Here we combine global datasets of Indigenous Peoples' lands, their current ecological condition, and future industrial development pressure to assess conversion threats. To assess vulnerability and risk of conversion, we create an index based on indicators of the strength and security of Indigenous Peoples' rights to their territories and resources, their representation and engagement in decisions impacting them, and the capital available to support conservation and sustainable development. We find that nearly 60% of Indigenous Peoples' lands (22.7 million km2) are threatened in 64 countries. Among the 37 countries with the highest threat, socio-economic and political vulnerabilities increase conversion risk, particularly the limited recognition and protection of territorial rights. We suggest strategies and actions to bolster Indigenous Peoples' self-determination, rights, and leadership to reduce this risk and foster socio-ecological well-being.",2023-08-01,2023,Christina M.

W4322774370,"Risk, lifestyle and non-communicable diseases of poverty","Common discourse in public health and preventive medicine frames non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, as diseases of 'lifestyle'; the choice of terminology implies that their prevention, control and management are amenable to individual action. In drawing attention to global increases in the incidence and prevalence of non-communicable disease, however, we increasingly observe that these are non-communicable diseases of poverty. In this article, we call for the reframing of discourse to emphasize the underlying social and commercial determinants of health, including poverty and the manipulation of food markets. We demonstrate this by analysing trends in disease, which indicate that diabetes- and cardiovascular-related DALYS and deaths are increasing particularly in countries categorized as low-middle to middle levels of development. In contrast, countries with very low levels of development contribute least to diabetes and document low levels of CVDs. Although this might suggest that NCDs track increased national wealth, the metrics obscure the ways in which the populations most affected by these diseases are among the poorest in many countries, and hence, disease incidence is a marker of poverty not wealth. We also illustrate variations in five countries - Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, India and Nigeria - by gender, and argue that these differences are associated with gender norms that vary by context rather than sex-specific biological pathways.We tie these trends to shifts in food consumption from whole foods to ultra-processed foods, under colonialism and with continued globalization. Industrialization and the manipulation of global food markets influence food choice in the context of limited household income, time, and household and community resources. Other factors that constitute risk factors for NCDs are likewise constrained by low household income and the poverty of the environment for people with low income, including the capacity of individuals in sedentary occupations to engage in physical activity. These contextual factors highlight extremely limited personal power over diet and exercise. In acknowledging the importance of poverty in shaping diet and activity, we argue the merit in using the term non-communicable diseases of poverty and the acronym NCDP. In doing so, we call for greater attention and interventions to address structural determinants of NCDs.",2023-03-02,2023,Lenore Manderson; Sara Jewett,Monash University,Globalization and Health,54,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-023-00914-z,Space_Aerospace,Poverty; Non-communicable disease; Public health; Tobacco control; Context (archaeology),0.15
W4361303511,A review of the IPCC Sixth Assessment and implications for tourism development and sectoral climate action,"The Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change represents the state of knowledge of anthropogenic disruption to the climate system, its diverse ecosystem and societal impacts, and the imperative for and challenges of mitigation and adaptation responses. It is foundational for global climate policymaking. This paper examines the place of tourism in AR6 and reviews its key findings for tourism's future. Overall, tourism related content declined relative to previous assessments. While notable improvements in content occurred for Africa, visible knowledge gaps remain in the tourism growth regions of South America, Middle East, and South Asia. There remains limited discussion of many impacts, and very limited understanding of integrated impacts and the effectiveness of adaptation strategies at the destination scale. The contribution of tourism to global emissions was omitted, however tourism was discussed in the context of luxury emissions and just transitions. Tourism is repeatedly identified in solution space discussions, particularly for ecosystem protection, but without consideration of the future of tourism in a rapidly decarbonizing and climate disrupted economy. With only 21% of published climate change and tourism literature in the AR6 review period cited, tourism academics should elevate tourism content and engagement in future assessments.",2023-03-29,2023,Daniel Scott; C.

W4366506520,Mainstreaming nature-based solutions in cities: A systematic literature review and a proposal for facilitating urban transitions,"Nature-based solutions are gaining prominence in urban sustainability discourses, especially in climate adaptation, in efforts to increase resilience, and as a means of promoting a range of social, environmental, and economic benefits. There are however barriers and inertia that slow the adoption of such solutions, and a term commonly used for overcoming such factors is mainstreaming. The term mainstreaming in relation to nature-based solutions is ambiguous, as it is entangled within or conflated with other similar concepts that also describe change processes. This lack of clarity is a cause for potential misdirection of planning with nature-based solutions towards more climate resilient cities. Therefore, this article expands and deepens the understanding of mainstreaming nature-based solutions in cities by proposing a (re)conceptualisation of the term mainstreaming. Our (re)conceptualisation explores mainstreaming in the context of multi-level governance, to unpack where mainstreaming can unfold within and across levels, and focuses on knowledge drivers, to unpack how mainstreaming activities are shaped. These dimensions are important for unpacking where mainstreaming can happen and what informs mainstreaming activities, facilitating more effective discourses, policy-making, and wider adoption of urban nature-based solutions. We report on a systematic literature review and synthesis of 147 articles, which proposes a new mainstreaming framework and definition by identifying five mechanisms and four roles to explain how mainstreaming processes unfold or mobilise in cities. This adds a framework and language to the academic and policy debate that is needed for operationalising nature-based solutions mainstreaming processes, and thereby to transform urban planning practices.",2023-04-20,2023,Clare Adams; Niki Frantzeskaki; Magnus Moglia,Swinburne University of Technology,Land Use Policy,54,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106661,Space_Aerospace,Mainstreaming; Context (archaeology); Corporate governance; Mainstream; Adaptation (eye),0.15

W4313471968,"Drones for Flood Monitoring, Mapping and Detection: A Bibliometric Review","Floods are one of the most often occurring and damaging natural hazards. They impact the society on a massive scale and result in significant damages. To reduce the impact of floods, society needs to keep benefiting from the latest technological innovations. Drones equipped with sensors and latest algorithms (e.g., computer vision and deep learning) have emerged as a potential platform which may be useful for flood monitoring, mapping and detection activities in a more efficient way than current practice. To better understand the scope and recent trends in the domain of drones for flood management, we performed a detailed bibliometric analysis. The intent of performing the bibliometric analysis waws to highlight the important research trends, co-occurrence relationships and patterns to inform the new researchers in this domain. The bibliometric analysis was performed in terms of performance analysis (i.e., publication statistics, citations statistics, top publishing countries, top publishing journals, top publishing institutions, top publishers and top Web of Science (WoS) categories) and science mapping (i.e., citations by country, citations by journals, keyword co-occurrences, co-authorship, co-citations and bibliographic coupling) for a total of 569 records extracted from WoS for the duration 2000–2022. The VOSviewer open source tool has been used for generating the bibliographic network maps. Subjective discussions of the results explain the obtained trends from the bibliometric analysis.

W4396695907,It's time to broaden what we consider a ‘blue carbon ecosystem’,"Abstract Photoautotrophic marine ecosystems can lock up organic carbon in their biomass and the associated organic sediments they trap over millennia and are thus regarded as blue carbon ecosystems. Because of the ability of marine ecosystems to lock up organic carbon for millennia, blue carbon is receiving much attention within the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a nature‐based solution (NBS) to climate change, but classically still focuses on seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, and tidal marshes. However, other coastal ecosystems could also be important for blue carbon storage, but remain largely neglected in both carbon cycling budgets and NBS strategic planning. Using a meta‐analysis of 253 research publications, we identify other coastal ecosystems—including mud flats, fjords, coralline algal (rhodolith) beds, and some components or coral reef systems—with a strong capacity to act as blue carbon sinks in certain situations. Features that promote blue carbon burial within these ‘non‐classical’ blue carbon ecosystems included: (1) balancing of carbon release by calcification via carbon uptake at the individual and ecosystem levels; (2) high rates of allochthonous organic carbon supply because of high particle trapping capacity; (3) high rates of carbon preservation and low remineralization rates; and (4) location in depositional environments. Some of these features are context‐dependent, meaning that these ecosystems were blue carbon sinks in some locations, but not others. Therefore, we provide a universal framework that can evaluate the likelihood of a given ecosystem to behave as a blue carbon sink for a given context. Overall, this paper seeks to encourage consideration of non‐classical blue carbon ecosystems within NBS strategies, allowing more complete blue carbon accounting.",2024-05-01,2024,Kelly James; Peter I.

W4391339901,Diversity in the digital age: how consumers respond to diverse virtual influencers,"In recent years the popularity of social media influencers has grown exponentially, in part because influencers tend to not be seen as advertising and they enable brands to reach engaged audiences. As such, influencer marketing is perceived as an effective and cost-effective marketing tool. However, like all areas of marketing there are broad-based shifts that are having significant effects on the domain of influencer marketing. First, there are calls for greater levels of diversity and broader representation of diverse communities. Second, digital innovation is having a profound effect on the field of influencer marketing, leading to the advent of virtual influencers that are artificially created, often through generative AI. These shifts raise questions about the effect of diversity in influencer marketing – with implications for brands that engage virtual influencers. In this paper, we present two experiments that investigate the effect of diversity representation in the context of virtual influencers. Results show that when brands engage virtual influencers to represent diverse subgroups, novelty and likeability act to mediate positive effects for the influencer (word-of-mouth and follow intentions) and the brand (purchase intentions).

Conservation efforts often prioritize safeguarding specific species, habitats, or intact ecosystems but overlook biodiversity's fundamental role in providing Nature's Contributions to People (NCP) in human-modified landscapes. Here, we systematically review 154 peer-reviewed studies to estimate the minimum levels of (semi-)natural habitat quantity, quality, and spatial configuration needed in human-modified landscapes to secure functional integrity essential for sustaining NCP provision. We find that the provision of multiple NCP is threatened when (semi-)natural habitat in the landscape falls below an area of 20%–25% for each km2. Five NCP almost completely disappear below a level of 10% habitat. The exact quantity, quality, and spatial configuration of habitat required depends on local context and specific NCP. Today, about two-thirds of human-modified lands have insufficient (semi-)natural habitat, requiring action for NCP regeneration.

W4390534399,Enhancing urban flood resilience: A coupling coordinated evaluation and geographical factor analysis under SES-PSR framework,"Urban flooding has emerged as a significant urban issue in cities worldwide, with China being particularly affected. To effectively manage and mitigate urban floods, a holistic examination of the interaction between urban subsystems is required to improve urban flood resilience. However, the interactions and mechanisms between urban subsystems under flood disaster haven't been addressed adequately in previous studies. Therefore, this paper established a conceptual framework for illustrating the interactions between urban natural-ecological and social-economic subsystem considering urban pressure, state, and response within flood cycle. The objective is to investigate the coupling coordination degree (CCD) between these subsystems and identify the driving factors with a geographical detector model, and the cities in Yangtze River Delta are selected as an empirical example. The findings reveal an overall upward trend towards coordination for the whole area with notable variability among the cities. The resilience of the state dimension emerges as a crucial aspect in determining the CCD of the urban flood resilience of the area. Key driving factors for the coordinated development of urban flood resilience are identified as air pollution, global warming, technological innovation, governance power, financial strength, and urbanization. Based on the findings and the interactions among the driving factors, this paper presents potential implications that can serve as effective guidance and offer insights for policymakers, planners, and researchers in their efforts to enhance urban flood resilience for sustainable development in the future.",2024-01-03,2024,Shi‐Yao Zhu; Haibo Feng; Mehrdad Arashpour; Fan Zhang,Monash University,International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,32,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2024.104243,Space_Aerospace,Flood myth; Urbanization; Urban resilience; Environmental planning; Psychological resilience,0.375
W4391074624,Residual wave vision U-Net for flood mapping using dual polarization Sentinel-1 SAR imagery,"The increasing severity, duration, and frequency of destructive floods can be attributed to shifts in climate, infrastructure, land use, and population demographics. Obtaining precise and timely data about the extent of floodwaters is crucial for effective emergency preparedness and mitigation efforts. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown astonishing effectiveness in various remote sensing applications, including flood mapping. One of the key limitations of CNNs is that they can only predict whether a desired feature will appear in an image, not where it can be recognized. To address this limitation, the incorporation of self-attention mechanisms deployed in vision transformers (ViTs) can be particularly effective. However, the self-attention modules in the ViTs are complex and computationally expensive, and they require a wealth of ground data to attain their full capability in image classification/segmentation. Thus, in this paper, we develop the Residual Wave Vision U-Net (WVResU-Net), a deep learning segmentation architecture that utilizes advanced Vision Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and ResU-Net for accurate and reliable flood mapping using Sentinel-1 SAR's dual polarization data. Results showed the significant superiority of the developed WVResU-Net algorithms over several well-known CNN and ViT deep learning models, including Swin U-Net, U-Net+++, Attention U-Net, R2U-Net, ResU-Net, TransU-Net and TransU-Net++. For example, the segmentation accuracy of TransU-Net++, SwinU-Net, ResU-Net, R2U-Net, Attention U-Net, TransU-Net, and U-Net+++, was significantly improved by approximately 5, 12, 13, 13, 16, 19, and 23 percentage points, respectively in terms of recall obtained by the WVResU-Net with a recall value of about 69.67%.

W4392194410,Freshwater wetland restoration and conservation are long-term natural climate solutions,"Freshwater wetlands have a disproportionately large influence on the global carbon cycle, with the potential to serve as long-term carbon sinks. Many of the world's freshwater wetlands have been destroyed or degraded, thereby affecting carbon-sink capacity. Ecological restoration of degraded wetlands is thus becoming an increasingly sought-after natural climate solution. Yet the time required to revert a degraded wetland from a carbon source to sink remains largely unknown. Moreover, increased methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions might complicate the climate benefit that wetland restoration may represent. We conducted a global meta-analysis to evaluate the benefits of wetland restoration in terms of net ecosystem carbon and greenhouse gas balance. Most studies (76 %) investigated the benefits of wetland restoration in peatlands (bogs, fens, and peat swamps) in the northern hemisphere, whereas the effects of restoration in non-peat wetlands (freshwater marshes, non-peat swamps, and riparian wetlands) remain largely unexplored. Despite higher CH4 emissions, most restored (77 %) and all natural peatlands were net carbon sinks, whereas most degraded peatlands (69 %) were carbon sources. Conversely, CH4 emissions from non-peat wetlands were similar across degraded, restored, and natural non-peat wetlands. When considering the radiative forcings and atmospheric lifetimes of the different greenhouse gases, the average time for restored wetlands to have a net cooling effect on the climate after restoration is 525 years for peatlands and 141 years for non-peat wetlands. The radiative benefit of wetland restoration does, therefore, not meet the timeframe set by the Paris Agreement to limit global warming by 2100. The conservation and protection of natural freshwater wetlands should be prioritised over wetland restoration as those ecosystems already play a key role in climate change mitigation.",2024-02-27,2024,Lukas Schuster; Pierre Taillardat; Peter I.

W4396698340,A review of nature‐based infrastructures and their effectiveness for urban flood risk mitigation,"Abstract Anthropogenic climate change and rapid urbanization are contributing to more frequent and intense urban flooding. There is widespread agreement that traditional gray infrastructure, a single‐purpose solution, fails to address the problem properly and contributes to adverse direct and indirect environmental impacts. As such, Nature‐based Solutions (NbS) can provide improved outcomes to flood risk management along with co‐benefits to society and the economy, as they have numerous benefits incuding often a smaller carbon footprint or even sometimes sequestering carbon. However, there is ambiguity and misconception about NbS and the uptake of NbS for flood management, which is still inadequate compared to traditional gray infrastructure. This research seeks to explore various nature‐based infrastructures including their present status of application for flood risk management to build resilience to urban flooding through a systematic literature review. The robustness of some NbS is questionable and varies across different spatial scales from plot to watershed. NbS can work stand‐alone in many cases as well as supplement traditional gray infrastructure to achieve wider benefits. The review provides a comparison of nature‐based solutions with gray infrastructure, identifies flood mitigation infrastructures that include nature‐based elements, and provides an overview of their effectiveness across different scales. The research findings should contribute to a better understanding of appropriate and diverse options of NbS, gray, and hybrid designs by policymakers and decision‐makers to enable them in effectively designing and implementing urban flood risk mitigation measures.

W4399793851,Environmental policy stringency and ecological footprint linkage: Mitigation measures of renewable energy and innovation,"We scrutinize the environmental policies' efficacy in reducing ecological footprint by interweaving two other vibrant parameters of environmental degradation mitigation, i.e., renewable energy sources and innovation. To this end, we apply a Cross-Sectional Autoregressive Distributed Lags (CS-ARDL) approach to analyze panel time-series data (1990–2018) in the context of OECD countries. Our analysis shows that environmental policy significantly reduces ecological footprint through renewable energy and innovation channels. Our findings also support the idea that environmental policy's effectiveness is conditional on countries' bio-capacity surplus/deficit and the level of industrialization. The overall findings hold up well in the presence of cross-sectional dependence, short-run heterogeneity, and long-run homogeneity under the respective sample. Our findings underscore the need for more stringent environmental policies, supported by technological advancements and clean energy initiatives, to mitigate the impact of human economic activities on natural resources.",2024-06-18,2024,Kazi Sohag; Shaiara Husain; Uğur Soytaş,Curtin University,Energy Economics,31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107721,Space_Aerospace,Ecological footprint; Renewable energy; Environmental degradation; Economics; Natural resource economics,0.375
W4394713403,Dynamics between energy intensity and carbon emissions: What does the clustering effect of labor and capital play?,"Energy depletion and environmental degradation have emerged as pressing concerns in the era of China's high-quality green economic development. We present an integrated framework that incorporate energy consumption intensity, industrial clustering, and carbon emissions into the STIRPAT framework. Our study examines 30 Chinese provinces from 2006 to 2017. Unlike previous analyses, our study measures industrial clustering from two dimensions: labor and capital clustering. Specifically, the benchmark results confirm that a 1% increase in energy consumption intensity will, on average, raise regional carbon emission intensity by 0.03389%. Moderating analysis shows that labor and capital clustering significantly lower carbon emission intensity by reducing energy consumption. These findings have been consolidated after performing a panel vector autoregressive model. Interestingly, the promoting effect of energy consumption intensity on carbon emission intensity tends to be tightened when labor clustering surpasses a threshold. In contrast, the corresponding effects substantially weaken after capital clustering exceeds a threshold. In all, these findings provide new evidence to understand the energy-emission nexus from an industrial clustering perspective.",2024-04-11,2024,Miaomiao Tao; Le Wen; Mingyue Selena Sheng; Zheng Yan; Stephen Poletti,University of Auckland,Journal of Cleaner Production,30,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142223,Space_Aerospace,Cluster analysis; Energy consumption; Greenhouse gas; Energy intensity; Intensity (physics),0.3
W4390937900,Older Adult Compendium of Physical Activities: Energy costs of human activities in adults aged 60 and older,"To describe the development of a Compendium for estimating the energy costs of activities in adults ≥60 years (OA Compendium). Physical activities (PAs) and their metabolic equivalent of task (MET) values were obtained from a systematic search of studies published in 4 sport and exercise databases (PubMed, Embase, SPORTDiscus (EBSCOhost), and Scopus) and a review of articles included in the 2011 Adult Compendium that measured PA in older adults. MET values were computed as the oxygen cost (VO2, mL/kg/min) during PA divided by 2.7 mL/kg/min (MET60+) to account for the lower resting metabolic rate in older adults. We identified 68 articles and extracted energy expenditure data on 427 PAs. From these, we derived 99 unique Specific Activity codes with corresponding MET60+ values for older adults. We developed a website to present the OA Compendium MET60+ values: https://pacompendium.com. The OA Compendium uses data collected from adults ≥60 years for more accurate estimation of the energy cost of PAs in older adults. It is an accessible resource that will allow researchers, educators, and practitioners to find MET60+ values for older adults for use in PA research and practice.",2024-01-01,2024,Erik A.

There is a complex relationship between food security and mental health. We carried out a narrative review study aiming to address how food insecurity impacts mental wellbeing by focusing on the mental health repercussions of food insecurity, recognizing its pivotal role in attaining Sustainable Development Goals 2 (on hunger) and 3 (on enhancing global wellbeing). A comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed and Google Scholar, incorporating Google searches for pertinent reports and policy documents. To address these questions, we emphasized and elucidated the interconnectedness between food security and mental health. The review shows that food security and mental health share a profound relationship influenced by multifaceted factors like socioeconomic conditions, access to nutritious food, and societal inequalities. We then provide recommendations for integrating food security into mental health strategies based on the insights and conclusions drawn. Strategies ranging from sustainable farming practices to urban agriculture initiatives and digital mental health services demonstrate avenues for enhancing food safety and mental wellbeing.

W3015636663,Federated Learning in Mobile Edge Networks: A Comprehensive Survey,"In recent years, mobile devices are equipped with increasingly advanced sensing and computing capabilities. Coupled with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), this opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications, e.g., for medical purposes and in vehicular networks. Traditional cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) approaches require the data to be centralized in a cloud server or data center. However, this results in critical issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency. To this end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been proposed to bring intelligence closer to the edge, where data is produced. However, conventional enabling technologies for ML at mobile edge networks still require personal data to be shared with external parties, e.g., edge servers. Recently, in light of increasingly stringent data privacy legislations and growing privacy concerns, the concept of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, end devices use their local data to train an ML model required by the server. The end devices then send the model updates rather than raw data to the server for aggregation. FL can serve as an enabling technology in mobile edge networks since it enables the collaborative training of an ML model and also enables DL for mobile edge network optimization. However, in a large-scale and complex mobile edge network, heterogeneous devices with varying constraints are involved. This raises challenges of communication costs, resource allocation, and privacy and security in the implementation of FL at scale. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the background and fundamentals of FL. Then, we highlight the aforementioned challenges of FL implementation and review existing solutions. Furthermore, we present the applications of FL for mobile edge network optimization. Finally, we discuss the important challenges and future research directions in FL.",2020-01-01,2020,Wei Yang Bryan Lim; Nguyen Cong Luong; Dinh Thai Hoang; Yutao Jiao; Ying‐Chang Liang,University of Technology Sydney,IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials,1930,https://doi.org/10.1109/comst.2020.2986024,Digital_Transformation,Computer science; Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution; Telecommunications,0.433

W3110989801,"Towards 6G wireless communication networks: vision, enabling technologies, and new paradigm shifts","Abstract The fifth generation (5G) wireless communication networks are being deployed worldwide from 2020 and more capabilities are in the process of being standardized, such as mass connectivity, ultra-reliability, and guaranteed low latency. However, 5G will not meet all requirements of the future in 2030 and beyond, and sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks are expected to provide global coverage, enhanced spectral/energy/cost efficiency, better intelligence level and security, etc. To meet these requirements, 6G networks will rely on new enabling technologies, i.e., air interface and transmission technologies and novel network architecture, such as waveform design, multiple access, channel coding schemes, multi-antenna technologies, network slicing, cell-free architecture, and cloud/fog/edge computing. Our vision on 6G is that it will have four new paradigm shifts. First, to satisfy the requirement of global coverage, 6G will not be limited to terrestrial communication networks, which will need to be complemented with non-terrestrial networks such as satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks, thus achieving a space-air-ground-sea integrated communication network. Second, all spectra will be fully explored to further increase data rates and connection density, including the sub-6 GHz, millimeter wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), and optical frequency bands. Third, facing the big datasets generated by the use of extremely heterogeneous networks, diverse communication scenarios, large numbers of antennas, wide bandwidths, and new service requirements, 6G networks will enable a new range of smart applications with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies. Fourth, network security will have to be strengthened when developing 6G networks. This article provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances and future trends in these four aspects. Clearly, 6G with additional technical requirements beyond those of 5G will enable faster and further communications to the extent that the boundary between physical and cyber worlds disappears.",2020-11-24,2020,Xiaohu You; Cheng‐Xiang Wang; Jie Huang; Xiqi Gao; Zaichen Zhang,University of Technology Sydney,Science China Information Sciences,1474,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11432-020-2955-6,Digital_Transformation,Computer science; Network architecture; Wireless network; Wireless; Computer network,0.85

W3095673945,Risk and Protective Factors for Prospective Changes in Adolescent Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The restrictions put in place to contain the COVID-19 virus have led to widespread social isolation, impacting mental health worldwide. These restrictions may be particularly difficult for adolescents, who rely heavily on their peer connections for emotional support. However, there has been no longitudinal research examining the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among adolescents. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' mental health, and moderators of change, as well as assessing the factors perceived as causing the most distress. Two hundred and forty eight adolescents (Mage = 14.4; 51% girls; 81.8% Caucasian) were surveyed over two time points; in the 12 months leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak (T1), and again two months following the implementation of government restrictions and online learning (T2). Online surveys assessed depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction at T1 and T2, and participants' schooling, peer and family relationships, social connection, media exposure, COVID-19 related stress, and adherence to government stay-at-home directives at T2 only. In line with predictions, adolescents experienced significant increases in depressive symptoms and anxiety, and a significant decrease in life satisfaction from T1 to T2, which was particularly pronounced among girls. Moderation analyses revealed that COVID-19 related worries, online learning difficulties, and increased conflict with parents predicted increases in mental health problems from T1 to T2, whereas adherence to stay-at-home orders and feeling socially connected during the COVID-19 lockdown protected against poor mental health. This study provides initial longitudinal evidence for the decline of adolescent's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results suggest that adolescents are more concerned about the government restrictions designed to contain the spread of the virus, than the virus itself, and that those concerns are associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and decreased life satisfaction.",2020-10-27,2020,Natasha R.

W3016959715,Family violence and COVID‐19: Increased vulnerability and reduced options for support,"Family violence refers to threatening or other violent behaviours within families that may be physical, sexual, psychological, or economic, and can include child abuse and intimate partner violence (Peterman et al. 2020, van Gelder et al. 2020). Family violence during pandemics is associated with a range of factors including economic stress, disaster-related instability, increased exposure to exploitative relationships, and reduced options for support (Peterman et al. 2020). Due to the social isolation measures implemented across the globe to help reduce the spread of COVID-19, people living in volatile situations of family violence are restricted to their homes. Social isolation exacerbates personal and collective vulnerabilities while limiting accessible and familiar support options (van Gelder et al. 2020). In many countries, including Australia, we have already seen an increase in demand for domestic violence services and reports of increased risk for children not attending schools (Duncan, 2020), a pattern similar to previous episodes of social isolation associated with epidemics and pandemics (Boddy, Young & O'Leary 2020). In Australia, as stay-at-home orders came into force, the police in some parts of the country reported a 40% drop in crime overall, but a 5% increase in domestic abuse call-outs (Kagi 2020). At the same time in Australia, Google reported a 75% increase in Internet searches relating to support for domestic abuse (Poate 2020). This pattern is repeated internationally. Reports of domestic abuse and family violence have increased around the world since social isolation and quarantine measures came into force. Recently, anecdotal evidence from the United States, China, Brazil, and Australia indicates increases in intimate partner, women, and children violence due to isolation and quarantine (Campbell 2020; Peterman et al. 2020; van Gelder et al. 2020). China, the first country to impose mass quarantine in the Wuhan province, saw reported domestic abuse incidents rise threefold in February 2020 compared to the previous year (Allen-Ebrahimian 2020). As Europe imposed quarantine measures in an effort to slow the tide of infection, the Italian government began commissioning hotels to provide shelter to the increasing number of people fleeing abusive situations (Davies & Batha 2020). Similarly, France reported a 32% - 36% increase in domestic abuse complaints following the implementation of self-isolation and quarantine measures (Reuters News Agency 2020). France also began commissioning hotels as shelters for those fleeing abuse. As quarantine measures extended to the United States, individual states reported similar increases in domestic abuse incidents ranging from 21% to 35% (Wagers 2020). Back in Europe, the UK has also seen concerns about increase in family violence (Bradbury-Jones & Isham 2020). There have been reports of homicide associated with family violence in several countries (Bradbury-Jones & Isham 2020; Reuters News Agency 2020). The National Domestic Abuse Hotline in the UK saw a 25% increase in calls since stay-at-home measures were implemented (Kelly & Morgan 2020), recording at least eight family violence-related deaths (Knowles 2020). As the novel coronavirus outbreak has intensified globally, countries are adopting dedicated measures to slow the spread of the virus through mitigation and containment (van Gelder et al. 2020; Campbell 2020). Social distancing and isolation are central to the public health strategy adopted by many countries, and in many settings, penalties are in place for any person who breaches these imposed restrictions. Social isolation requires families to remain in their homes resulting in intense and unrelieved contact as well as the depletion of existing support networks, such as through extended family as well as through social or community-based support networks for families at risk. Additionally, isolation places children at greater risk of neglect as well as physical, emotional, sexual, and domestic abuse (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children [NSPCC] 2020). Due to (necessary) imposed social distancing and isolation strategies, and the resulting shortages of essential resources and economic consequences of these measures, people globally are living under stressful conditions. While social isolation is an effective measure of infection control, it can lead to significant social, economic, and psychological consequences, which can be the catalyst for stress that can lead to violence. Isolation paired with psychological and economic stressors accompanying the pandemic as well as potential increases in negative coping mechanisms (e.g. excessive alcohol consumption) can come together in a perfect storm to trigger an unprecedented wave of family violence (van Gelder et al. 2020). In Australia, as social distancing measures came into place, alcohol good sales rose more than 36% (Commonwealth Bank Group 2020), and as restaurants, bars, and pubs closed, people are now drinking more within the confines of their homes. Unemployment figures around the world have rapidly risen into the double digits, with millions signing up for welfare payments and a worldwide recession predicted in the near future (Kennedy 2020). Substance misuse, financial strain, and isolation are all well-known domestic abuse risk factors (Richards 2009). During isolation, there are also fewer opportunities for people living with family violence to call for help. Isolation also helps to keep the abuse hidden with physical or emotional signs of family violence and abuse less visible to others (Stark 2009). Reports show that COVID-19 is used as a coercive control mechanism whereby perpetrators exert further control in an abusive relationship, specifically in the use of containment, fear, and threat of contagion as a mechanism of abuse. In Australia, charities providing support to people experiencing domestic abuse have highlighted concerns specifically related to reports from people whose intimate partners are using COVID-19 as a form of abuse. There have been reports of misinformation used by intimate partners related to the extent of quarantine measures (Gearin & Knight 2020) and other forms of COVID-19-related abuse (Fielding 2020). Further, there are reports that those experiencing domestic abuse may be afraid to go to hospital for fear of contracting COVID-19 (Fielding 2020). We recognize that these are challenging times for all of us, but especially for the most vulnerable families and children. The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently called for countries to prioritize support and set up emergency warning systems for people living with family violence (News Wires 2020). Pharmacies and grocery stores in France are now providing emergency warning systems to help enable people to indicate that they are in danger and need support (Guenfound 2020), through the introduction of code words to alert staff they need help (Davies & Batha 2020). Domestic abuse support agencies in some areas have published specific guidance on domestic abuse in COVID-19 focussing on what friends and family can do to support people who are isolated (Domestic Violence Resource Centre Australia [DVRCA] 2020). Charities are also recognizing the role that neighbours can play in supporting people living with family violence, providing advice on what to listen for and look for while they themselves are home, and encouraging conversation with neighbours (Gerster 2020). The fear and uncertainty associated with pandemics provide an enabling environment that may exacerbate or spark diverse forms of violence. Actions such as social distancing, sheltering in place, restricted travel, and closures of key community resources are likely to dramatically increase the risk of family violence (Campbell, 2020). Governments and policymakers must create awareness about an increased risk of violence during pandemics and highlight the need for people to keep in touch with each other (while observing precautionary measures) and the great importance of reporting any concerns of abuse. It is important to remember that maintaining social connectedness is an important strategy during times of isolation (Usher et al. 2020), even more so with family or friends you suspect may be at risk of family violence. In addition, information about services available locally (e.g. hotlines, tele-health, respite services, shelters, rape crisis centres, and counselling) must be made known to the general public through a range of sources, including social media, the mainstream media, and health facilities.

The ARRIVE guidelines need no introduction and we will not rehearse the arguments in depth here, other than to restate that the lack of key in vivo experimental details has been identified as a major contributing factor to the poor reproducibility of pre-clinical research. This fact was the primary driver for establishment by the NC3Rs of the first version of the ARRIVE guidelines. ARRIVE provided a 20-point checklist, specifying all of the experimental details (procedures and fixed factors) that should be included in manuscripts for proper reporting of animal research. The guidelines were rapidly endorsed internationally by funding bodies, universities, learned societies and, importantly, Life Science journals. Currently there are 1,046 journals endorsing ARRIVE including BJP, which was one of the original six influential journals that published the guidelines in full in 2010 (Kilkenny, Browne, Cuthill, Emerson, & Altman, 2010b). However, ARRIVE has not had the effect that was originally hoped for, despite this widespread support and endorsement. In 2016 and in 2018 assessments of adherence of articles published in endorsing journals identified a lack of engagement. As an example, one systematic review of reports of studies investigating acute lung injury revealed that, of the items expected for ARRIVE compliance, only 45% of those advised for inclusion in the Methods, and only 29% of those for inclusion in the Results section, were present (Avey et al., 2016). Moreover, formal endorsement of the ARRIVE guidelines by journals did not necessarily improve compliance (Leung, Rousseau-Blass, Beauchamp, & Pang, 2018). Such disappointing reports of outcome triggered a reappraisal of the guidelines led by the NC3Rs who, in 2018, established a new, international Working Group to review and update the ARRIVE guidelines to generate ARRIVE 2.0 (Percie du Sert et al., 2018). As with the team of experts brought together to establish the first iteration of ARRIVE, the Editor in Chief of the BJP is a member of the new team that was assembled. As such, the BJP has been well-placed to influence the content, testing and final publication of both iterations of the guidelines. In 2015, the BJP published an editorial reporting findings from a survey of compliance with ARRIVE in articles published in 2014 in two issues of the journal (McGrath & Lilley, 2015). The results were not as had been hoped for, as was also evident from assessments elsewhere, and revealed scope for improving compliance in respect of both the design of the (animal) experiments and the description of experimental procedures. To help remedy this problem, a checklist was developed that provided an aide memoire of the details of the animals and research procedures that should be reported in manuscripts submitted to the journal. A further editorial focussed on experimental design and data analysis (Curtis et al., 2018) for all types of experimental data published in the journal, including those emanating from experiments with animals, was also published. A key issue with many of the studies reported in BJP prior to this related to inadequate experimental design and inappropriate statistical analysis. At the same time, the Instructions to Authors were revised, to include the new rubric, and the editorial scrutiny of these aspects of the peer review process was tightened up. As a further prompt, in 2016, authors were required to make a Declaration as part of the submission process, to confirm that their manuscript was ARRIVE compliant. In addition to these measures, two new 'specialist' editors were appointed: a Design & Analysis Advisor and a Consulting Editor in ARRIVE Guidelines and Animal Welfare. The brief of the latter was to monitor ARRIVE compliance in BJP publications and to assist Senior Editors with their appraisal of manuscripts. All these changes still remain in place with the addition of a Consulting Editor in Statistical Analysis to ensure that the research reports match BJP criteria and so qualify for publication. ARRIVE 2.0 together with an 'Explanation and Elaboration' document was loaded onto the NC3Rs website in July 2019 as a preprint (i.e., before peer review (Percie du Sert et al., 2019)), and is now published in full in PLOS Biology (Percie du Sert et al., 2020), with simultaneous publication in several international journals, including this issue of the BJP (Percie du Sert et al., 2020). In preparation for the publication of the new guidelines we conducted surveys assessing compliance to ARRIVE in the BJP over 4 years, the results of which can be seen in Table 1. These data together with the July 2019 preprint of ARRIVE 2.0 were discussed extensively by the Senior Editorial Board of the BJP in December 2019. This editorial explains the ensuing changes in the journal's editorial policy as a result of those discussions and how they relate to ARRIVE 2.0. The principle of full disclosure lies at the heart of what we expect from authors wishing to publish in the BJP and in support of this principle is the absence of a word restriction for the Methods section. Judging from articles surveyed, between July 2014 and October 2019, most authors are conscientious about compliance with our 'Instructions to Authors' in respect of confirming ethical approval of the research, specifying the source, species and strain of animals and the inclusion of a statement on the translational relevance of the research study (Table 1). However, a general observation is that, although many manuscripts include lengthy details of the molecular biological or biochemical techniques that were used in the study, when experiments involved the use of animals, both the design of experiments and the description of the experimental procedures are often inadequately detailed making reproducibility challenging. Reporting of the method for killing animals has improved over the years but is still inconsistent, despite the need for manuscripts to be clear about when and how animals were killed. Information on housing and husbandry is often provided but, again, the level of detail is highly variable. Important elements, such as stocking density, configuration of group-housed animals (in respect of littermates, genotypes, or randomised mixed-caging, for example) provision of food (including, ideally, the composition of the laboratory diet) and water and environmental enrichment are not always disclosed, despite increasing recognition that these factors can affect the research findings (Finney et al., 2020; Reardon, 2016). The poor reporting of the provision of analgesia in the surgical context is particularly worrying. Of course, a lack of any mention of analgesia in the manuscript does not mean that none was provided; there could also be a strong scientific justification for withholding analgesia in some experiments. However, that did not apply to any of the manuscripts that were reviewed: in all those cases, analgesia could and should have been provided. Two options were considered by the Senior Editorial Board in December 2019: (i) endorse ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines and adopt them verbatim as official BJP policy or (ii) endorse ARRIVE 2.0 but devise our own reporting policy, which would be particularly relevant for pharmacologists. In considering the results of our surveys and the content of the ARRIVE 2.0 preprint, the Board decided on the latter approach. Authors should be reassured that nothing major has changed in practice. This journal has always taken inspiration from ARRIVE, while adopting a 'bespoke' approach to the reporting of the types of animal research carried out by pharmacologists. Authors should also note that requirements in respect of experimental design and analysis in articles published in BJP have not changed at all and can be found at: https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.14153 (Curtis et al., 2018). That said, we strongly advise authors to use the NC3Rs Experimental Design Assistant (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/experimental-design-assistant-eda) (Percie du Sert et al., 2017) when planning the experimental design and the data analysis of their work. The most striking change in the updated ARRIVE guidelines is the subdivision of the original checklist into two tables/checklists: the 'Essential 10' and the 'Recommended set'. The former focuses mainly on aspects of the experimental design that are essential for reducing bias (subjective or systematic), whereas the latter deals with points that pertain to the factors that authors are advised to disclose in order to enable others to replicate the experiment. Our current guidelines for experimental design and statistical analysis address many of the 'Essential 10', and for our modified approach we concentrate on many of the items in the 'Recommended set'. Our updated'BJP Declaration of Transparency and Scientific Rigour: Checklist for Animal Experimentation' is shown in Table 2, along with indicators of how each element connects with ARRIVE 2.0. These amendments do not challenge the importance of either version of ARRIVE. On the contrary, we strongly recommend that all authors read ARRIVE 2.0 (Percie du Sert, Hurst, et al., 2020) and familiarise themselves with the complementary 'Explanation and Elaboration' document (Percie du Sert et al., 2020). Essential 8 Essential 9 Recommended Recommended 12 Recommended 14 Recommended 15 Recommended 16 In terms of the details that should be included in every manuscript submitted to the BJP, the new checklist for reporting animal research will consist of the following six mandatory elements (see also Table 2): Details of the source, species, strain, sex, age and/or weight range of the animals used in the study must be given. A comprehensive account of the experimental procedure with particular attention to the use of any pharmacologically active agents at any stage of the study, including: anaesthesia, analgesia, antibiotics or any veterinary treatment administered for welfare purposes. Authors should also confirm that, for all surgical procedures, precautions to ensure aseptic conditions were applied throughout. Details of post-surgical analgesia and care of the animals should be provided, as should any procedures for monitoring the animals during post-operative recovery: e.g., the frequency and duration of the observations, temperature control etc. If analgesia cannot be given, this needs to be justified scientifically. A statement to confirm that the animals were killed by an individual trained to do this procedure, together with a description of how and when animals are killed, must also be included. In this context, authors should bear in mind that only certain methods for humane killing are permitted in the UK (and other countries governed by Directive 2010/63/EU) and these are stringently regulated. As a consequence, it might not be possible to consider a manuscript for publication in this journal if euthanasia has been carried out using a procedure that is regarded as unacceptable in the UK.One notable change to our policy is that whenever welfare assessments, or other precautions, were necessary during any stage of the research, these must now be reported, together with a clear definition of humane end-points. We acknowledge that these aspects of experimental conduct may well be implemented routinely in individual laboratories but, hitherto, they have not been perceived as an essential aspect of the research report. We want authors to include this information, as a matter of course, not least because other researchers in the field would find it important and helpful. Full details of the specific animal model that was used and the scientific justification for the choice of that model in the context of achieving the research objectives should be provided. This aspect of the report can be challenging, but we hope to encourage authors to be conservative and realistic when claiming to have used an animal 'model' of a complex human disorder (see next section). A statement to confirm that the research reported in the manuscript obtained local ethical approval is essential. BJP seeks to publish research on animals that conforms to standards upheld in the UK. Some elements should always be included, for example: type of housing, type of cage (open or individually ventilated) stocking density, food and water provision, bedding material, environmental enrichment, lighting regimen. For fish, details of the tank and the number of fish in each one should be included. Information on other elements should be included if they are crucial for the study or if they could affect the experimental results: e.g., the time of day the study took place, nature of handling/capture. The configuration of animals within cages should also be specified for instance, mixed or separate housing of genetically-altered/wildtypes or disease-susceptible/normal animals should be provided. Any welfare-related assessments, measurements and interventions that were carried out before, during, or after the study, especially if these were intended to ameliorate or limit the harms to the animals (e.g., humane end-points) must be reported. Another change is that both ARRIVE 2.0 and our revised BJP Declaration have removed the obligation to report any advance in the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) that has emerged from the research. This is partly because compliance with this has been negligible. Nevertheless, the BJP Senior Editorial Board recognises the importance of the 3Rs as part of the ethical framework for all research that uses animals and so we encourage authors to include this information whenever their findings have made a useful contribution to any of the 3Rs. The ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines are certainly viewed as an important step in helping to address the problem of poor reproducibility and translation of research findings in the biomedical sciences. However, successful translation also depends on a sound rationale for the research. So far, the attempts to improve reproducibility have somewhat overshadowed the growing scepticism about the validity of 'animal models' of some human disorders. In many cases, the creation of an animal model in order to carry out experiments, which would not be permitted in humans, is an entirely reasonable objective. That would be the case for human disorders that have an established link with a single genetic abnormality, such as cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Even in cases where a specific genetic mutation is a common, but not invariable, cause of the disorder (e.g., Fragile X syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), it is still reasonable to back-translate the mutation to create an animal model to investigate the underlying biological abnormalities and potential treatments. Few people would argue that those research findings are not instructive or that the description of the animal as a 'model' of the human disorder is scientifically unjustified. Even when there is no such clear causal link, it is valid to describe an animal as a 'model' when it expresses an abnormality that is convincingly analogous to the diagnostic biomarker(s) in humans. Examples of these would include: neoplasia, Cushing's/Addison's disease, diabetes, skin pigmentation diseases, myasthenia gravis. Even though treatment strategies that are effective in the animals often do not translate into humans, it is still reasonable to regard them as 'models' of the human condition and such research has contributed a great deal to our understanding of the illnesses. It is far more difficult to be confident about the validity of animal models of complex, multifactorial human illnesses, which can comprise a mixture of any of several pathological, physiological and behavioural abnormalities, which can be primary or secondary features of the illness. These would include conditions such as: hypertension, heart failure, renal failure, metabolic syndrome, neurological and psychiatric disorders. In all these cases, the profile and/or severity of the underlying problems can differ substantially from patient to patient, but still meet the criteria for the same broad clinical diagnosis. In such cases, we hope to encourage authors to be more cautious about claims that their 'animal model' is analogous to the human condition. This is especially important for 'models' that are based on evidence from procedures that are normally used as drug screens to predict therapeutic efficacy in humans (see, for example: Stanford, 2017). In such cases, authors should justify their assumption that the abnormality that is being evaluated in the baseline condition (i.e, with no experimental intervention such as drug treatment or genetic alteration) is a valid model of the human illness or a particular aspects of that illness. On the other hand, we want to discourage non-committal descriptions such as 'cirrhosis-like', 'epilepsy-like' or 'autism-like', or vague terms, such as 'asthma' instead of 'respiratory allergy'. Instead, our aim is to encourage authors to be precise about the extent to which aspect(s) of the human disorder are expressed in the animal model, and also to acknowledge its limitations. Where these questions have been very well analysed for any particular model, it is appropriate for authors to cite the relevant literature explaining why the animal model is appropriate. We believe this is timely advice because there is burgeoning interest in research of 'endophenotypes' in which a specific aspect of an animal's normal/abnormal physiology or behaviour can be mapped onto an underlying genetic mutation or physiological system (e.g., neuronal network, or other physiological feedback loop) – and which are often not confined to a single human disorder. This approach further acknowledges that some human illnesses are better regarded as assemblies of endophenotypes, rather than unitary disorders. Obviously, the definition of an endophenotype also needs scrupulous validation, but this change of mindset will be essential for successful progress in stratified and personalised medicine. A final point, addressed only indirectly by ARRIVE 2.0, concerns the validity of some research procedures that are used to produce the 'model' (see: Stanford, 2020). Examples include some experimental interventions to induce end-stage heart failure, or the use of environmental stressors that are intended to alter the physiology and/or behaviour of the animals. Examples include the use of environmental stressors, such as electric shocks or a series of unpredictable stressors that change from day to day, sometimes for several weeks. In most cases, the individual stressors are mild and can arguably be regarded as analogous to challenges faced by some humans and which impair their mental health, but this is not always the case. Some of these experiments involve prolonged bouts of stressors, which would be regarded as severe, especially when their cumulative harm is taken into account. In such cases, the BJP will require authors to provide assurance that the severity and duration of the aversive stimuli was the minimum required to meet the scientific objectives of the study, particularly when using a series of unpredictable stressors, for instance. Also, in order to underpin the validity of such animal 'models', authors should include a statement to clarify the ways in which the aversive stimuli used in the research are relevant to the manifestation of the disorder of interest, which is being modelled in the animals. In response to the publication of the revised ARRIVE guidelines (ARRIVE 2.0), the Senior Editorial Board of this journal has revised the policy on reporting of animal research. The primary principle remains the same as before, which is to encourage full disclosure of all relevant information and to expect to see evidence for high standards of animal welfare. It is important to remember that this is not simply for the benefit of the animals. High standards of experimental design, reporting and animal welfare are crucial if the research is to be reproducible and translatable. In that context, we encourage authors to read Drummond and Vowler (2013). The BJP has, for some time, taken the view that the prevailing standards expected by the regulatory framework in the UK should be reflected in the journal's publications. For example, studies of proprietary tobacco products are not permitted in the UK and the BJP will not publish them. Similarly, death as an endpoint, in non-regulatory studies would not normally be acceptable (with the exception of studies of anti-cancer and certain antimicrobial drugs, for example), but when current regulatory guidelines still mandate mortality endpoints, we expect humane endpoints to be described fully and implemented. Some experiments that involve procedures that would be regarded as 'severe' but can, nonetheless, be scientifically justified. However, the justification for some such procedures might not be clear. In most of these cases, a discussion between the editor(s) and the authors would seek to confirm whether or not there was a robust justification for using such procedures, or humane endpoints, regardless of any local ethical approval for the study. If this turns out to be the case, the manuscript may be published. Finally, raising the standard of research reporting will certainly help to improve reproducibility but, to improve translation will also require a more realistic, evidence-based appraisal of the validity of the experimental procedures and research 'models'. To that end, we want to encourage authors to consider the extent to which the models they have investigated really do offer insight into the causes, pathology and treatment of multifactorial human disorders. In cases where there is any doubt, authors should be assured that more modest objectives and clarity about the specific features of the disorder that have been 'modelled' would attract even more confidence and scientific merit.

W3159080474,Federated Learning for Internet of Things: A Comprehensive Survey,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is penetrating many facets of our daily life with the proliferation of intelligent services and applications empowered by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may not be feasible in realistic application scenarios due to the high scalability of modern IoT networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed collaborative AI approach that can enable many intelligent IoT applications, by allowing for AI training at distributed IoT devices without the need for data sharing. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging applications of FL in IoT networks, beginning from an introduction to the recent advances in FL and IoT to a discussion of their integration. Particularly, we explore and analyze the potential of FL for enabling a wide range of IoT services, including IoT data sharing, data offloading and caching, attack detection, localization, mobile crowdsensing, and IoT privacy and security. We then provide an extensive survey of the use of FL in various key IoT applications such as smart healthcare, smart transportation, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), smart cities, and smart industry. The important lessons learned from this review of the FL-IoT services and applications are also highlighted.

W4323653529,Technology Roadmap for Flexible Sensors,"Humans rely increasingly on sensors to address grand challenges and to improve quality of life in the era of digitalization and big data. For ubiquitous sensing, flexible sensors are developed to overcome the limitations of conventional rigid counterparts. Despite rapid advancement in bench-side research over the last decade, the market adoption of flexible sensors remains limited. To ease and to expedite their deployment, here, we identify bottlenecks hindering the maturation of flexible sensors and propose promising solutions. We first analyze challenges in achieving satisfactory sensing performance for real-world applications and then summarize issues in compatible sensor-biology interfaces, followed by brief discussions on powering and connecting sensor networks. Issues en route to commercialization and for sustainable growth of the sector are also analyzed, highlighting environmental concerns and emphasizing nontechnical issues such as business, regulatory, and ethical considerations. Additionally, we look at future intelligent flexible sensors. In proposing a comprehensive roadmap, we hope to steer research efforts towards common goals and to guide coordinated development strategies from disparate communities.

W3103622949,Strategies for the Stabilization of Zn Metal Anodes for Zn‐Ion Batteries,"Abstract Zinc‐ion batteries (ZIBs) are regarded as a promising candidate for next‐generation energy storage systems due to their high safety, resource availability, and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, the instability of the Zn metal anode has impeded ZIBs from being reliably deployed in their proposed applications. Specifically, dendrite formation and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the Zn surface significantly compromise the Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability of ZIBs. In recent years, increasing efforts have been devoted to overcoming these obstacles by electrode structure design, interface modification, and electrolyte/separator optimization. To achieve an insightful and comprehensive understanding of these strategies, it is worth analyzing and categorizing them according to their intrinsic mechanisms. Considering this, an overview of the anodic stabilization strategies is provided. First, the fundamentals of the Zn metal anode are introduced, and the associated reaction mechanisms are presented. Furthermore, strategies of dendrite and HER suppression are categorized, discussed, and analyzed in detail. Last, suggestions for Zn anode deployment in ZIBs from research, industrialization, and commercialization aspects are proposed. It is expected that this Review and the proposed strategies will shed light on the roadmap for the exploration of novel Zn metal anodes for ZIBs.",2020-11-16,2020,Zhehan Yi; Guoyuan Chen; Feng Hou; Liqun Wang; Ji Liang,University of Wollongong,Advanced Energy Materials,838,https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202003065,Digital_Transformation,Materials science; Anode; Faraday efficiency; Nanotechnology; Commercialization,0.3
W3100536113,Toward Smart Wireless Communications via Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces: A Contemporary Survey,"This paper presents a literature review on recent applications and design aspects of the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in the future wireless networks. Conventionally, the network optimization has been limited to transmission control at two endpoints, i.e., end users and network controller. The fading wireless channel is uncontrollable and becomes one of the main limiting factors for performance improvement. The IRS is composed of a large array of scattering elements, which can be individually configured to generate additional phase shifts to the signal reflections. Hence, it can actively control the signal propagation properties in favor of signal reception, and thus realize the notion of a smart radio environment. As such, the IRS's phase control, combined with the conventional transmission control, can potentially bring performance gain compared to wireless networks without IRS. In this survey, we first introduce basic concepts of the IRS and the realizations of its reconfigurability. Then, we focus on applications of the IRS in wireless communications. We overview different performance metrics and analytical approaches to characterize the performance improvement of IRS-assisted wireless networks. To exploit the performance gain, we discuss the joint optimization of the IRS's phase control and the transceivers' transmission control in different network design problems, e.g., rate maximization and power minimization problems. Furthermore, we extend the discussion of IRS-assisted wireless networks to some emerging use cases. Finally, we highlight important practical challenges and future research directions for realizing IRS-assisted wireless networks in beyond 5G communications.",2020-01-01,2020,Shimin Gong; Xiao Lu; Dinh Thai Hoang; Dusit Niyato; Lei Shu,University of Technology Sydney,IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials,831,https://doi.org/10.1109/comst.2020.3004197,Digital_Transformation,Wireless; Telecommunications; Computer science; Human–computer interaction,0.358
W3005050626,Scientists' warning to humanity on insect extinctions,"Here we build on the manifesto 'World Scientists' Warning to Humanity, issued by the Alliance of World Scientists. As a group of conservation biologists deeply concerned about the decline of insect populations, we here review what we know about the drivers of insect extinctions, their consequences, and how extinctions can negatively impact humanity. We are causing insect extinctions by driving habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, use of polluting and harmful substances, the spread of invasive species, global climate change, direct overexploitation, and co-extinction of species dependent on other species. With insect extinctions, we lose much more than species. We lose abundance and biomass of insects, diversity across space and time with consequent homogenization, large parts of the tree of life, unique ecological functions and traits, and fundamental parts of extensive networks of biotic interactions. Such losses lead to the decline of key ecosystem services on which humanity depends. From pollination and decomposition, to being resources for new medicines, habitat quality indication and many others, insects provide essential and irreplaceable services. We appeal for urgent action to close key knowledge gaps and curb insect extinctions. An investment in research programs that generate local, regional and global strategies that counter this trend is essential.

W4280540675,A guide to the organ-on-a-chip,"Organs-on-chips (OoCs) are systems containing engineered or natural miniature tissues grown inside microfluidic chips. To better mimic human physiology, the chips are designed to control cell microenvironments and maintain tissue-specific functions. Combining advances in tissue engineering and microfabrication, OoCs have gained interest as a next-generation experimental platform to investigate human pathophysiology and the effect of therapeutics in the body. There are as many examples of OoCs as there are applications, making it difficult for new researchers to understand what makes one OoC more suited to an application than another. This Primer is intended to give an introduction to the aspects of OoC that need to be considered when developing an application-specific OoC. The Primer covers guiding principles and considerations to design, fabricate and operate an OoC, as well as subsequent assaying techniques to extract biological information from OoC devices. Alongside this is a discussion of current and future applications of OoC technology, to inform design and operational decisions during the implementation of OoC systems.

W3048071531,True Meaning of Pseudocapacitors and Their Performance Metrics: Asymmetric versus Hybrid Supercapacitors,"The development of pseudocapacitive materials for energy-oriented applications has stimulated considerable interest in recent years due to their high energy-storing capacity with high power outputs. Nevertheless, the utilization of nanosized active materials in batteries leads to fast redox kinetics due to the improved surface area and short diffusion pathways, which shifts their electrochemical signatures from battery-like to the pseudocapacitive-like behavior. As a result, it becomes challenging to distinguish ""pseudocapacitive"" and ""battery"" materials. Such misconceptions have further impacted on the final device configurations. This Review is an earnest effort to clarify the confusion between the battery and pseudocapacitive materials by providing their true meanings and correct performance metrics. A method to distinguish battery-type and pseudocapacitive materials using the electrochemical signatures and quantitative kinetics analysis is outlined. Taking solid-state supercapacitors (SSCs, only polymer gel electrolytes) as an example, the distinction between asymmetric and hybrid supercapacitors is discussed. The state-of-the-art progress in the engineering of active materials is summarized, which will guide for the development of real-pseudocapacitive energy storage systems.",2020-08-06,2020,Nilesh R.

W3017089210,Blockchain for Industry 4.0: A Comprehensive Review,"Due to the proliferation of ICT during the last few decades, there is an exponential increase in the usage of various smart applications such as smart farming, smart healthcare, supply-chain & logistics, business, tourism and hospitality, energy management etc. However, for all the aforementioned applications, security and privacy are major concerns keeping in view of the usage of the open channel, i.e., Internet for data transfer. Although many security solutions and standards have been proposed over the years to enhance the security levels of aforementioned smart applications, but the existing solutions are either based upon the centralized architecture (having single point of failure) or having high computation and communication costs. Moreover, most of the existing security solutions have focussed only on few aspects and fail to address scalability, robustness, data storage, network latency, auditability, immutability, and traceability. To handle the aforementioned issues, blockchain technology can be one of the solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we present a systematic review of various blockchain-based solutions and their applicability in various Industry 4.0-based applications. Our contributions in this paper are in four fold. Firstly, we explored the current state-of-the-art solutions in the blockchain technology for the smart applications.

Accordingly, by drawing on the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, we explain how individuals' positivity can result in their flourishment and development in any aspect of life, including L2 learning and teaching. Then, we introduce and conceptualize seven instances of positive psychology variables, namely academic engagement, emotion regulation, enjoyment, grit, loving pedagogy, resilience, and well-being and explain how these positive factors contribute to desirable L2 learning and teaching experiences. Subsequently, potential theoretical and pedagogical implications are drawn to enhance the quality and effectiveness of language education systems and their respective stakeholders. In the end, the limitations of the studies in this area are explicated, and suggestions for future research are provided to expand the extant literature on positive psychology in the domain of L2 education.",2021-08-19,2021,Yongliang Wang; Ali Derakhshan; Lawrence Jun Zhang,University of Auckland,Frontiers in Psychology,649,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.731721,Digital_Transformation,Positive psychology; Psychology; Foreign language; Extant taxon; Psychological resilience,0.15

W3211270128,Enabling Joint Communication and Radar Sensing in Mobile Networks—A Survey,"Mobile network is evolving from a communication-only network towards one with joint communication and radar/radio sensing (JCAS) capabilities, that we call perceptive mobile network (PMN). Radio sensing here refers to information retrieval from received mobile signals for objects of interest in the environment surrounding the radio transceivers, and it may go beyond the functions of localization, tracking, and object recognition of traditional radar. In PMNs, JCAS integrates sensing into communications, sharing a majority of system modules and the same transmitted signals. The PMN is expected to provide a ubiquitous radio sensing platform and enable a vast number of novel smart applications, whilst providing non-compromised communications. In this paper, we present a broad picture of the motivation, methodologies, challenges, and research opportunities of realizing PMN, by providing a comprehensive survey for systems and technologies developed mainly in the last ten years. Beginning by reviewing the work on coexisting communication and radar systems, we highlight their limits on addressing the interference problem, and then introduce the JCAS technology. We then set up JCAS in the mobile network context and envisage its potential applications. We continue to provide a brief review of three types of JCAS systems, with particular attention to their differences in design philosophy. We then introduce a framework of PMN, including the system platform and infrastructure, three types of sensing operations, and signals usable for sensing. Subsequently, we discuss required system modifications to enable sensing on current communication-only infrastructure. Within the context of PMN, we review stimulating research problems and potential solutions, organized under nine topics: performance bounds, waveform optimization, antenna array design, clutter suppression, sensing parameter estimation, resolution of sensing ambiguity, pattern analysis, networked sensing under cellular topology, and sensing-assisted communications. We conclude the paper by listing key open research problems for the aforementioned topics and sharing some lessons that we have learned.",2021-10-25,2021,J. Andrew Zhang; Md.

W3049115827,From Li‐Ion Batteries toward Na‐Ion Chemistries: Challenges and Opportunities,"Abstract Among the existing energy storage technologies, lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) have unmatched energy density and versatility. From the time of their first commercialization in 1991, the growth in LIBs has been driven by portable devices. In recent years, however, large‐scale electric vehicle and stationary applications have emerged. Because LIB raw material deposits are unevenly distributed and prone to price fluctuations, these large‐scale applications have put unprecedented pressure on the LIB value chain, resulting in the need for alternative energy storage chemistries. The sodium‐ion battery (SIB) chemistry is one of the most promising “beyond‐lithium” energy storage technologies. Herein, the prospects and key challenges for the commercialization of SIBs are discussed. By comparing the technological evolutions of both LIBs and SIBs, key differences between the two battery chemistries are unraveled. Based on outstanding results in power, cyclability, and safety, the path toward SIB commercialization is seen imminent.",2020-08-12,2020,Kudakwashe Chayambuka; Grietus Mulder; Dmitri L.

W4285004952,"The Metaverse as a Virtual Form of Smart Cities: Opportunities and Challenges for Environmental, Economic, and Social Sustainability in Urban Futures","Data infrastructures, economic processes, and governance models of digital platforms are increasingly pervading urban sectors and spheres of urban life. This phenomenon is known as platformization, which has in turn given rise to the phenomena of platform society, where platforms have permeated the core of urban societies. A recent manifestation of platformization is the Metaverse, a global platform project launched by Meta (formerly Facebook) as a globally operating platform company. The Metaverse represents an idea of a hypothetical “parallel virtual world” that incarnate ways of living and working in virtual cities as an alternative to smart cities of the future. Indeed, with emerging innovative technologies—such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, the IoT, and Digital Twins—providing rich datasets and advanced computational understandings of human behavior, the Metaverse has the potential to redefine city designing activities and service provisioning towards increasing urban efficiencies, accountabilities, and quality performance. However, there still remain ethical, human, social, and cultural concerns as to the Metaverse’s influence upon the quality of human social interactions and its prospective scope in reconstructing the quality of urban life. This paper undertakes an upper-level literature review of the area of the Metaverse from a broader perspective. Further, it maps the emerging products and services of the Metaverse, and explores their potential contributions to smart cities with respect to their virtual incarnation, with a particular focus on the environmental, economic, and social goals of sustainability. This study may help urban policy makers to better understand the opportunities and implications of the Metaverse upon tech-mediated practices and applied urban agendas, as well as assess the positives and negatives of this techno-urban vision. This paper also offers thoughts regarding the argument that the Metaverse has disruptive and substantive effects on forms of reconstructing reality in an increasingly platformized urban society.

W3000455992,A Hybrid BlockChain-Based Identity Authentication Scheme for Multi-WSN,"Internet of Things (IoT) equipment is usually in a harsh environment, and its security has always been a widely concerned issue. Node identity authentication is an important means to ensure its security. Traditional IoT identity authentication protocols usually rely on trusted third parties. However, many IoT environments do not allow such conditions, and are prone to single point failure. Blockchain technology with decentralization features provides a new solution for distributed IoT system. In this paper, a blockchain based multi-WSN authentication scheme for IoT is proposed. The nodes of IoT are divided into base stations, cluster head nodes and ordinary nodes according to their capability differences, which are formed to a hierarchical network. A blockchain network is constructed among different types of nodes to form a hybrid blockchain model, including local chain and public chain. In this hybrid model, nodes identity mutual authentication in various communication scenarios is realized, ordinary node identity authentication operation is accomplished by local blockchain, and cluster head node identity authentication are realized in public blockchain. The analysis of security and performance shows that the scheme has comprehensive security and better performance.",2020-01-01,2020,Zhihua Cui; Fei Xue; Shiqiang Zhang; Xingjuan Cai; Yang Cao,Swinburne University of Technology,IEEE Transactions on Services Computing,453,https://doi.org/10.1109/tsc.2020.2964537,Digital_Transformation,Computer science; Blockchain; Authentication (law); Node (physics); Computer network,0.867

Phthalates can be found in most products that have contact with plastics during producing, packaging, or delivering. Despite the short half-lives in tissues, chronic exposure to phthalates will adversely influence the endocrine system and functioning of multiple organs, which has negative long-term impacts on the success of pregnancy, child growth and development, and reproductive systems in both young children and adolescents. Several countries have established restrictions and regulations on some types of phthalates; however, we think that more countries should establish constraints or substitute measures for phthalates to reduce health risks.

W3045516846,Dynamic Event-Triggered Distributed Coordination Control and its Applications: A Survey of Trends and Techniques,"Distributed coordination control is the current trend in networked systems and finds prosperous applications across a variety of fields, such as smart grids and intelligent transportation systems. One fundamental issue in coordinating and controlling a large group of distributed and networked agents is the influence of intermittent interagent interactions caused by constrained communication resources. Event-triggered communication scheduling stands out as a promising enabler to strike a balance between the desired control performance and the satisfactory resource efficiency. What distinguishes dynamic event-triggered scheduling from traditional static event-triggered scheduling is that the triggering mechanism can be dynamically adjusted over time in accordance with both available system information and additional dynamic variables. This article provides an up-to-date overview of dynamic event-triggered distributed coordination control. The motivation of dynamic event-triggered scheduling is first introduced in the context of distributed coordination control.

Drawing from an international sample of N = 739 higher education teachers in 58 countries, the present study sheds light on teachers' readiness for OTL at the time of the pandemic by (a) identifying teacher profiles based on a set of key dimensions of readiness; (b) explaining profile membership by individual teacher characteristics, contextual aspects of the shift to OTL, and country-level indicators representing educational innovation and cultural orientation. We conducted latent profile analysis and identified three teacher profiles with consistently high or low readiness or an inconsistent readiness profile—hence, teachers in higher education are not a homogeneous group. Importantly, key individual and contextual variables, such as teachers' gender and prior OTL experience, the context of the OTL shift, the innovation potential in education, and cultural orientation, explained profile membership. We discuss these findings with respect to the nature of the profiles, how they can be understood with respect to key determinants, and their implications for OTL in higher education.",2020-12-30,2020,Ronny Scherer; Sarah Howard; Jo Tondeur; Fazilat Siddiq,University of Wollongong,Computers in Human Behavior,443,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106675,Digital_Transformation,Profiling (computer programming); Psychology; Mathematics education; Online learning; Pedagogy,0.225

The discovery of temporal soliton states (DKS dissipative Kerr solitons) [4,7-11] as a means of modelocking microcombs has enabled breakthroughs in many fields including spectroscopy [12,13], microwave photonics [14], frequency synthesis [15], optical ranging [16,17], quantum sources [18,19], metrology [20,21] and more. One of their most promising applications has been optical fibre communications where they have enabled massively parallel ultrahigh capacity multiplexed data transmission [22,23]. Here, by using a new and powerful class of microcomb called soliton crystals [11], we achieve unprecedented data transmission over standard optical fibre using a single integrated chip source. We demonstrate a line rate of 44.2 Terabits per second using the telecommunications C band at 1550nm with a spectral efficiency, a critically important performance metric, of 10.4 bits/s/Hz. Soliton crystals exhibit robust and stable generation and operation as well as a high intrinsic efficiency that, together with a low soliton microcomb spacing of 48.9 GHz enable the use of a very high coherent data modulation format of 64 QAM (quadrature amplitude modulated). We demonstrate error free transmission over 75 km of standard optical fibre in the laboratory as well as in a field trial over an installed metropolitan optical fibre network. These experiments were greatly aided by the ability of the soliton crystals to operate without stabilization or feedback control.

Since its debut in the mid-1990s, Siesta's flexibility, efficiency, and free distribution have given advanced materials simulation capabilities to many groups worldwide. The core methodological scheme of Siesta combines finite-support pseudo-atomic orbitals as basis sets, norm-conserving pseudopotentials, and a real-space grid for the representation of charge density and potentials and the computation of their associated matrix elements. Here, we describe the more recent implementations on top of that core scheme, which include full spin-orbit interaction, non-repeated and multiple-contact ballistic electron transport, density functional theory (DFT)+U and hybrid functionals, time-dependent DFT, novel reduced-scaling solvers, density-functional perturbation theory, efficient van der Waals non-local density functionals, and enhanced molecular-dynamics options. In addition, a substantial effort has been made in enhancing interoperability and interfacing with other codes and utilities, such as wannier90 and the second-principles modeling it can be used for, an AiiDA plugin for workflow automatization, interface to Lua for steering Siesta runs, and various post-processing utilities. Siesta has also been engaged in the Electronic Structure Library effort from its inception, which has allowed the sharing of various low-level libraries, as well as data standards and support for them, particularly the PSeudopotential Markup Language definition and library for transferable pseudopotentials, and the interface to the ELectronic Structure Infrastructure library of solvers.

W3095114374,Sleep and the athlete: narrative review and 2021 expert consensus recommendations,"Elite athletes are particularly susceptible to sleep inadequacies, characterised by habitual short sleep (&lt;7 hours/night) and poor sleep quality (eg, sleep fragmentation). Athletic performance is reduced by a night or more without sleep, but the influence on performance of partial sleep restriction over 1–3 nights, a more real-world scenario, remains unclear. Studies investigating sleep in athletes often suffer from inadequate experimental control, a lack of females and questions concerning the validity of the chosen sleep assessment tools. Research only scratches the surface on how sleep influences athlete health. Studies in the wider population show that habitually sleeping &lt;7 hours/night increases susceptibility to respiratory infection. Fortunately, much is known about the salient risk factors for sleep inadequacy in athletes, enabling targeted interventions. For example, athlete sleep is influenced by sport-specific factors (relating to training, travel and competition) and non-sport factors (eg, female gender, stress and anxiety). This expert consensus culminates with a sleep toolbox for practitioners (eg, covering sleep education and screening) to mitigate these risk factors and optimise athlete sleep. A one-size-fits-all approach to athlete sleep recommendations (eg, 7–9 hours/night) is unlikely ideal for health and performance. We recommend an individualised approach that should consider the athlete’s perceived sleep needs. Research is needed into the benefits of napping and sleep extension (eg, banking sleep).",2020-11-03,2020,Neil P. Walsh; Shona L. Halson; Charli Sargent; Gregory D.

Special attention is paid to tracking the surface reconstruction process and identifying real catalytic species under different testing conditions, which highlight the significant distinctions of corresponding electrochemical reconstruction mechanisms. Advances in catalyst designs for industry‐relevant water electrolysis are also summarized, which reveal the progress of moving the practical applications forward and accelerating synergies between material science and engineering.

W3122785574,Tuning the Selective Adsorption Site of Biomass on Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> by Ir Single Atoms for Electrosynthesis,"Abstract The electrosynthesis from 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is considered a green strategy to achieve biomass‐derived high‐value chemicals. As the molecular structure of HMF is relatively complicated, understanding the HMF adsorption/catalysis behavior on electrocatalysts is vital for biomass‐based electrosynthesis. The electrocatalysis behavior can be modulated by tuning the adsorption energy of the reactive molecules. In this work, the HMF adsorption behavior on spinel oxide, Co 3 O 4 is discovered. Correspondingly, the adsorption energy of HMF on Co 3 O 4 is successfully tuned by decorating with single‐atom Ir. It is observed that compared with bare Co 3 O 4 , single‐atom‐Ir‐loaded Co 3 O 4 (Ir‐Co 3 O 4 ) can enhance adsorption with the CC groups of HMF. The synergetic adsorption can enhance the overall conversion of HMF on electrocatalysts. With the modulated HMF adsorption, the as‐designed Ir‐Co 3 O 4 exhibits a record performance (with an onset potential of 1.15 V RHE ) for the electrosynthesis from HMF.",2021-01-20,2021,Yuxuan Lu; Tianyang Liu; Chung‐Li Dong; Yucheng Huang; Yafei Li,University of Wollongong,Advanced Materials,380,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202007056,Digital_Transformation,Electrosynthesis; Adsorption; Electrocatalyst; Catalysis; Materials science,0.3

ICD-11’s information framework comprises a semantic knowledge base (the Foundation), a biomedical ontology linked to the Foundation and classifications derived from the Foundation. ICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (ICD-11-MMS) is the primary derived classification and the main successor to ICD-10. Innovations enabled by the new architecture include an online coding tool (replacing the index and providing additional functions), an application program interface to enable remote access to ICD-11 content and services, enhanced capability to capture and combine clinically relevant characteristics of cases and integrated support for multiple languages. Conclusions ICD-11 was adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2019. Transition to implementation is in progress. ICD-11 can be accessed at icd.who.int.",2021-11-01,2021,James Harrison; Stefanie Weber; Robert Jakob; Christopher G.

W3095553850,Photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction to CO over Ni Single Atoms Supported on Defect‐Rich Zirconia,"The photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) holds great promise for curbing anthropogenic CO2 emissions, though boosting photocatalyst activity and tuning product selectivity remain key priorities. Herein, isolated Ni single atoms dispersed on defect rich zirconia (Ni-SA-x/ZrO2) are identified as a very promising photocatalyst for CRR under Xe lamp irradiation, showing good activity and CO selectivity in the absence of added sacrificial agents or sensitizers. Due to an abundance of accessible nickel single atomic sites, the optimized photocatalyst affords CO at a rate of 11.8 µmol g−1 h−1 (92.5% selectivity). Experimental and theoretical investigations determine that the atomically dispersed Ni sites lower the energy barrier for CO2 to CO conversion via an adsorbed COOH intermediate, while also suppressing H2 desorption in the competing water splitting reaction. The Ni single atom sites thus simultaneously promote CO2 conversion and CO selectivity, thus offering valuable new insights for the future design of improved metal single-atom catalysts for CRR.",2020-10-26,2020,Xuyang Xiong; Chengliang Mao; Zhaojun Yang; Qinghua Zhang; Geoffrey I.

W3111367879,Hydrogels as Drug Delivery Systems: A Review of Current Characterization and Evaluation Techniques,"Owing to their tunable properties, controllable degradation, and ability to protect labile drugs, hydrogels are increasingly investigated as local drug delivery systems. However, a lack of standardized methodologies used to characterize and evaluate drug release poses significant difficulties when comparing findings from different investigations, preventing an accurate assessment of systems. Here, we review the commonly used analytical techniques for drug detection and quantification from hydrogel delivery systems. The experimental conditions of drug release in saline solutions and their impact are discussed, along with the main mathematical and statistical approaches to characterize drug release profiles. We also review methods to determine drug diffusion coefficients and in vitro and in vivo models used to assess drug release and efficacy with the goal to provide guidelines and harmonized practices when investigating novel hydrogel drug delivery systems.",2020-12-07,2020,Margaux Vigata; Christoph Meinert; Dietmar W.

W4229371730,Personalization in personalized marketing: Trends and ways forward,"Abstract In marketing, personalization is the action of designing and producing in ways that resonate with customer preferences. Content and products that are personalized according to customer preferences can reduce customer fatigue and time in making choices, thereby decreasing their cognitive load. Despite its importance, the literature on personalized marketing remains fragmented due to the absence of a comprehensive review that consolidates the intellectual structure of the field. This study bridges this knowledge gap through a bibliometric review using performance analysis and science mapping. Through a comprehensive review of 383 publications, this study reveals the publication and citation trends, the most prolific authors, journals, and publications, and six major themes (i.e., personalized recommendation, personalized relationship, personalization–privacy paradox, personalized advertising, personalization concept and discourse in marketing, and customer insights in personalized marketing) that characterize the body of knowledge of personalized marketing. The study concludes with future research directions as ways forward for personalized marketing, wherein a focus on new‐age technologies involving artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain, internet of things, and wearables is encouraged to explore new ways to curate personalized experiences across online and offline channels.",2022-05-09,2022,Shobhana Chandra; Sanjeev Verma; Weng Marc Lim; Satish Kumar; Naveen Donthu,Swinburne University of Technology,Psychology and Marketing,369,https://doi.org/10.1002/mar.21670,Digital_Transformation,Personalization; Personalized marketing; The Internet; Field (mathematics); Computer science,0.358
W3159562992,Energy-Efficient Smart Routing Based on Link Correlation Mining for Wireless Edge Computing in IoT,"Modern Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications are heavily data driven and often require reliable data streams to achieve high-quality data mining. The concept of edge computing is introduced to reduce data latency and communication bandwidth between the cloud server and IoT edge devices. However, inefficient routing that may cause transmission failure or unnecessary data (re)transmission is still a key obstacle to obtain good and reliable data mining results. In this article, network coding combined with opportunistic routing is used to improve energy efficiency in wireless IoT infrastructure, considering the existence of link correlation. Studies have shown that packet receptions on wireless links are correlated, which is completely contrary to the assumption of link independence used in existing routing mechanisms. This assumption causes estimation errors in the calculation of expected number of transmissions for forwarders, which further affects the selection of forwarder set, and ultimately affects the performance of the protocol. We propose an intrasession network coding mechanism based on the mining of link correlation. A novel smart routing method is proposed to accurately estimate the number of transmissions required by forwarders, together with an algorithm for selecting a forwarder set with more optimal number of transmissions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can achieve fewer transmissions and offer more energy-efficient communications for wireless edge IoT applications.",2021-05-06,2021,Xiaokang Zhou; Xiang Yang; Jianhua Ma; Kevin I‐Kai Wang,University of Auckland,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,363,https://doi.org/10.1109/jiot.2021.3077937,Digital_Transformation,Computer science; Computer network; Forwarder; Network packet; Distributed computing,0.492
