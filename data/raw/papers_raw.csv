The PRISMA 2020 statement: an updated guideline for reporting systematic reviews,"The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, published in 2009, was designed to help systematic reviewers transparently report why the review was done, what the authors did, and what they found. Over the past decade, advances in systematic review methodology and terminology have necessitated an update to the guideline. The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement and includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise, and synthesise studies. The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation. In this article, we present the PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagrams for original and updated reviews.","[""Matthew J.

Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently.MethodsIn an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety.Download a PDF of the Research Summary.ResultsA total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups.ConclusionsA two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines. (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04368728.)

An interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time,"In December, 2019, a local outbreak of pneumonia of initially unknown cause was detected in Wuhan (Hubei, China), and was quickly determined to be caused by a novel coronavirus,1WHOWHO statement regarding cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China.https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/09-01-2020-who-statement-regarding-cluster-of-pneumonia-cases-in-wuhan-chinaDate: Jan 9, 2020Date accessed: February 11, 2020Google Scholar namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak has since spread to every province of mainland China as well as 27 other countries and regions, with more than 70 000 confirmed cases as of Feb 17, 2020.2WHOCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation reports.https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reportsDate accessed: February 17, 2020Google Scholar In response to this ongoing public health emergency, we developed an online interactive dashboard, hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA, to visualise and track reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in real time. The dashboard, first shared publicly on Jan 22, illustrates the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries for all affected countries. It was developed to provide researchers, public health authorities, and the general public with a user-friendly tool to track the outbreak as it unfolds. All data collected and displayed are made freely available, initially through Google Sheets and now through a GitHub repository, along with the feature layers of the dashboard, which are now included in the Esri Living Atlas. The dashboard reports cases at the province level in China; at the city level in the USA, Australia, and Canada; and at the country level otherwise. During Jan 22–31, all data collection and processing were done manually, and updates were typically done twice a day, morning and night (US Eastern Time). As the outbreak evolved, the manual reporting process became unsustainable; therefore, on Feb 1, we adopted a semi-automated living data stream strategy. Our primary data source is DXY, an online platform run by members of the Chinese medical community, which aggregates local media and government reports to provide cumulative totals of COVID-19 cases in near real time at the province level in China and at the country level otherwise. Every 15 min, the cumulative case counts are updated from DXY for all provinces in China and for other affected countries and regions. For countries and regions outside mainland China (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), we found DXY cumulative case counts to frequently lag behind other sources; we therefore manually update these case numbers throughout the day when new cases are identified. To identify new cases, we monitor various Twitter feeds, online news services, and direct communication sent through the dashboard. Before manually updating the dashboard, we confirm the case numbers with regional and local health departments, including the respective centres for disease control and prevention (CDC) of China, Taiwan, and Europe, the Hong Kong Department of Health, the Macau Government, and WHO, as well as city-level and state-level health authorities. For city-level case reports in the USA, Australia, and Canada, which we began reporting on Feb 1, we rely on the US CDC, the government of Canada, the Australian Government Department of Health, and various state or territory health authorities. All manual updates (for countries and regions outside mainland China) are coordinated by a team at Johns Hopkins University. The case data reported on the dashboard aligns with the daily Chinese CDC3Chinese Center for Disease Control and PreventionTracking the epidemic.http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/news/TrackingtheEpidemic.htmDate accessed: February 11, 2020Google Scholar and WHO situation reports2WHOCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation reports.https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reportsDate accessed: February 17, 2020Google Scholar for within and outside of mainland China, respectively (figure). Furthermore, the dashboard is particularly effective at capturing the timing of the first reported case of COVID-19 in new countries or regions (appendix). With the exception of Australia, Hong Kong, and Italy, the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University has reported newly infected countries ahead of WHO, with Hong Kong and Italy reported within hours of the corresponding WHO situation report. Given the popularity and impact of the dashboard to date, we plan to continue hosting and managing the tool throughout the entirety of the COVID-19 outbreak and to build out its capabilities to establish a standing tool to monitor and report on future outbreaks. We believe our efforts are crucial to help inform modelling efforts and control measures during the earliest stages of the outbreak. This online publication has been corrected.

Full-Text PDF SeroTracker: a global SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence dashboardAs the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic passes its peak in many countries, serological studies are becoming increasingly important in guiding public health responses. Antibody testing is crucial for monitoring the evolution of the pandemic, providing a more complete picture of the total number of people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) than molecular diagnostic testing alone.1 All individuals with SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies have been exposed to the virus, so antibody testing can highlight differences in past exposure between regions, demographic groups, and occupations.

"Global Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases and Risk Factors, 1990–2019","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), principally ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, are the leading cause of global mortality and a major contributor to disability. This paper reviews the magnitude of total CVD burden, including 13 underlying causes of cardiovascular death and 9 related risk factors, using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019. GBD, an ongoing multinational collaboration to provide comparable and consistent estimates of population health over time, used all available population-level data sources on incidence, prevalence, case fatality, mortality, and health risks to produce estimates for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Prevalent cases of total CVD nearly doubled from 271 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 257 to 285 million) in 1990 to 523 million (95% UI: 497 to 550 million) in 2019, and the number of CVD deaths steadily increased from 12.1 million (95% UI:11.4 to 12.6 million) in 1990, reaching 18.6 million (95% UI: 17.1 to 19.7 million) in 2019. The global trends for disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost also increased significantly, and years lived with disability doubled from 17.7 million (95% UI: 12.9 to 22.5 million) to 34.4 million (95% UI:24.9 to 43.6 million) over that period. The total number of DALYs due to IHD has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 182 million (95% UI: 170 to 194 million) DALYs, 9.14 million (95% UI: 8.40 to 9.74 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 197 million (95% UI: 178 to 220 million) prevalent cases of IHD in 2019. The total number of DALYs due to stroke has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 143 million (95% UI: 133 to 153 million) DALYs, 6.55 million (95% UI: 6.00 to 7.02 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 101 million (95% UI: 93.2 to 111 million) prevalent cases of stroke in 2019. Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of disease burden in the world. CVD burden continues its decades-long rise for almost all countries outside high-income countries, and alarmingly, the age-standardized rate of CVD has begun to rise in some locations where it was previously declining in high-income countries. There is an urgent need to focus on implementing existing cost-effective policies and interventions if the world is to meet the targets for Sustainable Development Goal 3 and achieve a 30% reduction in premature mortality due to noncommunicable diseases.","[""Gregory A.

Review of Particle Physics,"Abstract The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 2,143 new measurements from 709 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Machine Learning, and one on Spectroscopy of Light Meson Resonances. The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 97 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 23 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings. The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print, as a web version optimized for use on phones, and as an Android app.","[""Ronald Workman"", ""Volker Burkert"", ""V.

"The revised International Association for the Study of Pain definition of pain: concepts, challenges, and compromises","The current International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) definition of pain as ""An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage""was recommended by the Subcommittee on Taxonomy and adopted by the IASP Council in 1979. This definition has become accepted widely by health care professionals and researchers in the pain field and adopted by several professional, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, including the World Health Organization. In recent years, some in the field have reasoned that advances in our understanding of pain warrant a reevaluation of the definition and have proposed modifications. Therefore, in 2018, the IASP formed a 14-member, multinational Presidential Task Force comprising individuals with broad expertise in clinical and basic science related to pain, to evaluate the current definition and accompanying note and recommend whether they should be retained or changed. This review provides a synopsis of the critical concepts, the analysis of comments from the IASP membership and public, and the committee's final recommendations for revisions to the definition and notes, which were discussed over a 2-year period. The task force ultimately recommended that the definition of pain be revised to ""An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage,""and that the accompanying notes be updated to a bulleted list that included the etymology. The revised definition and notes were unanimously accepted by the IASP Council early this year.","[""Srinivasa N. Raja"", ""Daniel B.

"Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder Among Children Aged 8 Years — Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 11 Sites, United States, 2016","Description of System:The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network is an active surveillance program that provides estimates of the prevalence of ASD among children aged 8 years whose parents or guardians live in 11 ADDM Network sites in the United States (Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin).Surveillance is conducted in two phases.The first phase involves review and abstraction of comprehensive evaluations that were completed by medical and educational service providers in the community.In the second phase, experienced clinicians who systematically review all abstracted information determine ASD case status.The case definition is based on ASD criteria described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Results: For 2016, across all 11 sites, ASD prevalence was 18.5 per 1,000 (one in 54) children aged 8 years, and ASD was 4.3 times as prevalent among boys as among girls.ASD prevalence varied by site, ranging from 13.1 (Colorado) to 31.4 (New Jersey).Prevalence estimates were approximately identical for non-Hispanic white (white), non-Hispanic black (black), and Asian/ Pacific Islander children (18.5, 18.3, and 17.9, respectively) but lower for Hispanic children (15.4).Among children with ASD for whom data on intellectual or cognitive functioning were available, 33% were classified as having intellectual disability (intelligence quotient [IQ] ≤70); this percentage was higher among girls than boys (40% versus 32%) and among black and Hispanic than white children (47%, 36%, and 27%, respectively).Black children with ASD were less likely to have a first evaluation by age 36 months than were white children with ASD (40% versus 45%).The overall median age at earliest known ASD diagnosis (51 months) was similar by sex and racial and ethnic groups; however, black children with IQ ≤70 had a later median age at ASD diagnosis than white children with IQ ≤70 (48 months versus 42 months). Interpretation:The prevalence of ASD varied considerably across sites and was higher than previous estimates since 2014.Although no overall difference in ASD prevalence between black and white children aged 8 years was observed, the disparities for black children persisted in early evaluation and diagnosis of ASD.Hispanic children also continue to be identified as having ASD less frequently than white or black children.Public Health Action: These findings highlight the variability in the evaluation and detection of ASD across communities and between sociodemographic groups.Continued efforts are needed for early and equitable identification of ASD and timely enrollment in services.","[""Matthew J.

Copper induces cell death by targeting lipoylated TCA cycle proteins,"Copper is an essential cofactor for all organisms, and yet it becomes toxic if concentrations exceed a threshold maintained by evolutionarily conserved homeostatic mechanisms. How excess copper induces cell death, however, is unknown. Here, we show in human cells that copper-dependent, regulated cell death is distinct from known death mechanisms and is dependent on mitochondrial respiration. We show that copper-dependent death occurs by means of direct binding of copper to lipoylated components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This results in lipoylated protein aggregation and subsequent iron-sulfur cluster protein loss, which leads to proteotoxic stress and ultimately cell death. These findings may explain the need for ancient copper homeostatic mechanisms.","[""Peter Tsvetkov"", ""Shannon Coy"", ""Boryana Petrova"", ""Margaret Dreishpoon"", ""Ana Verma"", ""Mai Abdusamad"", ""Jordan Rossen"", ""Lena Joesch-Cohen"", ""Ranad Humeidi"", ""Ryan D.

The Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative: Standardized Quantitative Radiomics for High-Throughput Image-based Phenotyping,"The image biomarker standardisation initiative (IBSI) is an independent international collaboration which works towards standardising the extraction of image biomarkers from acquired imaging for the purpose of high-throughput quantitative image analysis (radiomics). Lack of reproducibility and validation of high-throughput quantitative image analysis studies is considered to be a major challenge for the field. Part of this challenge lies in the scantiness of consensus-based guidelines and definitions for the process of translating acquired imaging into high-throughput image biomarkers. The IBSI therefore seeks to provide image biomarker nomenclature and definitions, benchmark data sets, and benchmark values to verify image processing and image biomarker calculations, as well as reporting guidelines, for high-throughput image analysis.","[""Alex Zwanenburg"", ""Martin Valli\u00e8res"", ""Mahmoud A.

A framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblasts,"Abstract Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a key component of the tumour microenvironment with diverse functions, including matrix deposition and remodelling, extensive reciprocal signalling interactions with cancer cells and crosstalk with infiltrating leukocytes. As such, they are a potential target for optimizing therapeutic strategies against cancer. However, many challenges are present in ongoing attempts to modulate CAFs for therapeutic benefit. These include limitations in our understanding of the origin of CAFs and heterogeneity in CAF function, with it being desirable to retain some antitumorigenic functions. On the basis of a meeting of experts in the field of CAF biology, we summarize in this Consensus Statement our current knowledge and present a framework for advancing our understanding of this critical cell type within the tumour microenvironment.","[""Erik Sahai"", ""Igor Astsaturov"", ""Edna Cukierman"", ""David G.

Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes,"Cancer is driven by genetic change, and the advent of massively parallel sequencing has enabled systematic documentation of this variation at the whole-genome scale1-3. Here we report the integrative analysis of 2,658 whole-cancer genomes and their matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We describe the generation of the PCAWG resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4-5 driver mutations when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however, in around 5% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis, in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations, structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter4; identifies new signatures of mutational processes that cause base substitutions, small insertions and deletions and structural variation5,6; analyses timings and patterns of tumour evolution7; describes the diverse transcriptional consequences of somatic mutation on splicing, expression levels, fusion genes and promoter activity8,9; and evaluates a range of more-specialized features of cancer genomes8,10-18.","[""Lauri A.

Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in U.S. Children and Adolescents,"Understanding the epidemiology and clinical course of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and its temporal association with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is important, given the clinical and public health implications of the syndrome. We conducted targeted surveillance for MIS-C from March 15 to May 20, 2020, in pediatric health centers across the United States. The case definition included six criteria: serious illness leading to hospitalization, an age of less than 21 years, fever that lasted for at least 24 hours, laboratory evidence of inflammation, multisystem organ involvement, and evidence of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), antibody testing, or exposure to persons with Covid-19 in the past month. Clinicians abstracted the data onto standardized forms. We report on 186 patients with MIS-C in 26 states. The median age was 8.3 years, 115 patients (62%) were male, 135 (73%) had previously been healthy, 131 (70%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or antibody testing, and 164 (88%) were hospitalized after April 16, 2020. Organ-system involvement included the gastrointestinal system in 171 patients (92%), cardiovascular in 149 (80%), hematologic in 142 (76%), mucocutaneous in 137 (74%), and respiratory in 131 (70%). The median duration of hospitalization was 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 10); 148 patients (80%) received intensive care, 37 (20%) received mechanical ventilation, 90 (48%) received vasoactive support, and 4 (2%) died. Coronary-artery aneurysms (z scores ≥2.5) were documented in 15 patients (8%), and Kawasaki's disease-like features were documented in 74 (40%). Most patients (171 [92%]) had elevations in at least four biomarkers indicating inflammation. The use of immunomodulating therapies was common: intravenous immune globulin was used in 144 (77%), glucocorticoids in 91 (49%), and interleukin-6 or 1RA inhibitors in 38 (20%). Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with SARS-CoV-2 led to serious and life-threatening illness in previously healthy children and adolescents.

Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (4th edition)<sup>1</sup>,"In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines formonitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a Do not distribute. difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated fromstimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate withmore autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis,whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be themost appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field.","[""Daniel J.

Expanded encyclopaedias of DNA elements in the human and mouse genomes,"Abstract The human and mouse genomes contain instructions that specify RNAs and proteins and govern the timing, magnitude, and cellular context of their production. To better delineate these elements, phase III of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project has expanded analysis of the cell and tissue repertoires of RNA transcription, chromatin structure and modification, DNA methylation, chromatin looping, and occupancy by transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins. Here we summarize these efforts, which have produced 5,992 new experimental datasets, including systematic determinations across mouse fetal development. All data are available through the ENCODE data portal ( https://www.encodeproject.org ), including phase II ENCODE 1 and Roadmap Epigenomics 2 data. We have developed a registry of 926,535 human and 339,815 mouse candidate cis -regulatory elements, covering 7.9 and 3.4% of their respective genomes, by integrating selected datatypes associated with gene regulation, and constructed a web-based server (SCREEN; http://screen.encodeproject.org ) to provide flexible, user-defined access to this resource. Collectively, the ENCODE data and registry provide an expansive resource for the scientific community to build a better understanding of the organization and function of the human and mouse genomes.","[""Federico Abascal"", ""Reyes Acosta"", ""Nicholas J.

"2019 American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation Guideline for the Management of Osteoarthritis of the Hand, Hip, and Knee","Objective To develop an evidence‐based guideline for the comprehensive management of osteoarthritis ( OA ) as a collaboration between the American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) and the Arthritis Foundation, updating the 2012 ACR recommendations for the management of hand, hip, and knee OA . Methods We identified clinically relevant population, intervention, comparator, outcomes questions and critical outcomes in OA . A Literature Review Team performed a systematic literature review to summarize evidence supporting the benefits and harms of available educational, behavioral, psychosocial, physical, mind‐body, and pharmacologic therapies for OA . Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to rate the quality of the evidence. A Voting Panel, including rheumatologists, an internist, physical and occupational therapists, and patients, achieved consensus on the recommendations. Results Based on the available evidence, either strong or conditional recommendations were made for or against the approaches evaluated. Strong recommendations were made for exercise, weight loss in patients with knee and/or hip OA who are overweight or obese, self‐efficacy and self‐management programs, tai chi, cane use, hand orthoses for first carpometacarpal ( CMC ) joint OA , tibiofemoral bracing for tibiofemoral knee OA , topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAID s) for knee OA , oral NSAID s, and intraarticular glucocorticoid injections for knee OA . Conditional recommendations were made for balance exercises, yoga, cognitive behavioral therapy, kinesiotaping for first CMC OA , orthoses for hand joints other than the first CMC joint, patellofemoral bracing for patellofemoral knee OA , acupuncture, thermal modalities, radiofrequency ablation for knee OA , topical NSAID s, intraarticular steroid injections and chondroitin sulfate for hand OA , topical capsaicin for knee OA , acetaminophen, duloxetine, and tramadol. Conclusion This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making treatment decisions for the management of OA . Clinicians and patients should engage in shared decision‐making that accounts for patients’ values, preferences, and comorbidities. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.","[""Sharon L. Kolasinski"", ""Tuhina Neogi"", ""Marc C. Hochberg"", ""Carol A. Oatis"", ""Gordon Guyatt"", ""Joel A.

Minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles (MISEV2023): From basic to advanced approaches,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs), through their complex cargo, can reflect the state of their cell of origin and change the functions and phenotypes of other cells. These features indicate strong biomarker and therapeutic potential and have generated broad interest, as evidenced by the steady year-on-year increase in the numbers of scientific publications about EVs. Important advances have been made in EV metrology and in understanding and applying EV biology. However, hurdles remain to realising the potential of EVs in domains ranging from basic biology to clinical applications due to challenges in EV nomenclature, separation from non-vesicular extracellular particles, characterisation and functional studies. To address the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) updates its 'Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles', which was first published in 2014 and then in 2018 as MISEV2014 and MISEV2018, respectively. The goal of the current document, MISEV2023, is to provide researchers with an updated snapshot of available approaches and their advantages and limitations for production, separation and characterisation of EVs from multiple sources, including cell culture, body fluids and solid tissues. In addition to presenting the latest state of the art in basic principles of EV research, this document also covers advanced techniques and approaches that are currently expanding the boundaries of the field. MISEV2023 also includes new sections on EV release and uptake and a brief discussion of in vivo approaches to study EVs. Compiling feedback from ISEV expert task forces and more than 1000 researchers, this document conveys the current state of EV research to facilitate robust scientific discoveries and move the field forward even more rapidly.","[""Joshua A Welsh"", ""Deborah C.

"Sequencing of 53,831 diverse genomes from the NHLBI TOPMed Program","Abstract The Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) programme seeks to elucidate the genetic architecture and biology of heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders, with the ultimate goal of improving diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these diseases. The initial phases of the programme focused on whole-genome sequencing of individuals with rich phenotypic data and diverse backgrounds. Here we describe the TOPMed goals and design as well as the available resources and early insights obtained from the sequence data. The resources include a variant browser, a genotype imputation server, and genomic and phenotypic data that are available through dbGaP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes) 1 . In the first 53,831 TOPMed samples, we detected more than 400 million single-nucleotide and insertion or deletion variants after alignment with the reference genome. Additional previously undescribed variants were detected through assembly of unmapped reads and customized analysis in highly variable loci. Among the more than 400 million detected variants, 97% have frequencies of less than 1% and 46% are singletons that are present in only one individual (53% among unrelated individuals). These rare variants provide insights into mutational processes and recent human evolutionary history. The extensive catalogue of genetic variation in TOPMed studies provides unique opportunities for exploring the contributions of rare and noncoding sequence variants to phenotypic variation. Furthermore, combining TOPMed haplotypes with modern imputation methods improves the power and reach of genome-wide association studies to include variants down to a frequency of approximately 0.01%.","[""Daniel Taliun"", ""Daniel Harris"", ""Michael D.

COVID-19: the gendered impacts of the outbreak,"Policies and public health efforts have not addressed the gendered impacts of disease outbreaks.1Smith J Overcoming the ""tyranny of the urgent"": integrating gender into disease outbreak preparedness and response.Gender Develop. 2019; 27: 355-369Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar The response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears no different. We are not aware of any gender analysis of the outbreak by global health institutions or governments in affected countries or in preparedness phases. Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions. Although sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men and women so far, there seem to be sex differences in mortality and vulnerability to the disease.2The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology TeamThe epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVD-19).China CDC Weekly. 2020; 2: 113-122Google Scholar Emerging evidence suggests that more men than women are dying, potentially due to sex-based immunological3Chen N Zhou M Dong X et al.Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 507-513Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14366) Google Scholar or gendered differences, such as patterns and prevalence of smoking.4Liu S Zhang M Yang L et al.Prevalence and patterns of tobacco smoking among Chinese adult men and women: findings of the 2010 national smoking survey.J Epidemiol Community Health. 2017; 71: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar However, current sex-disaggregated data are incomplete, cautioning against early assumptions. Simultaneously, data from the State Council Information Office in China suggest that more than 90% of health-care workers in Hubei province are women, emphasising the gendered nature of the health workforce and the risk that predominantly female health workers incur.5Boniol M McIsaac M Xu L Wuliji T Diallo K Campbell J Gender equity in the health workforce: analysis of 104 countries: Working Paper 1.

Feb 18, 2020; Google Scholar Consideration is further needed of the gendered implications of quarantine, such as whether women and men's different physical, cultural, security, and sanitary needs are recognised. Experience from past outbreaks shows the importance of incorporating a gender analysis into preparedness and response efforts to improve the effectiveness of health interventions and promote gender and health equity goals. During the 2014–16 west African outbreak of Ebola virus disease, gendered norms meant that women were more likely to be infected by the virus, given their predominant roles as caregivers within families and as front-line health-care workers.7Davies SE Bennett B A gendered human rights analysis of Ebola and Zika: locating gender in global health emergencies.Int Aff. 2016; 92: 1041-1060Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar Women were less likely than men to have power in decision making around the outbreak, and their needs were largely unmet.8Harman S Ebola, gender and conspicuously invisible women in global health governance.Third World Quart. 2016; 37: 524-541Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar For example, resources for reproductive and sexual health were diverted to the emergency response, contributing to a rise in maternal mortality in a region with one of the highest rates in the world.9Sochas L Channon AA Nam S Counting indirect crisis-related deaths in the context of a low-resilience health system: the case of maternal and neonatal health during the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone.Health Policy Plan. 2017; 32: iii32-iii39Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar During the Zika virus outbreak, differences in power between men and women meant that women did not have autonomy over their sexual and reproductive lives,10Wenham C Arevalo A Coast E et al.Zika, abortion and health emergencies: a review of contemporary debates.Global Health. 2019; 15: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar which was compounded by their inadequate access to health care and insufficient financial resources to travel to hospitals for check-ups for their children, despite women doing most of the community vector control activities.11Wenham C Nunes J Correa Matta G de Oliveira Nogueira C Aparecida Valente P Pimenta DN Gender mainstreaming as a pathway for sustainable arbovirus control in Latin America.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2020; 14e0007954Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar Given their front-line interaction with communities, it is concerning that women have not been fully incorporated into global health security surveillance, detection, and prevention mechanisms.

Although women should not be further burdened, particularly considering much of their labour during health crises goes underpaid or unpaid, incorporating women's voices and knowledge could be empowering and improve outbreak preparedness and response. Despite the WHO Executive Board recognising the need to include women in decision making for outbreak preparedness and response,12WHOExecutive Board EB146/Conf/17: strengthening preparedness for health emergencies; implementation of International Health Regulations, IHR (2005).

March 3, 2020; Google Scholar If the response to disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 is to be effective and not reproduce or perpetuate gender and health inequities, it is important that gender norms, roles, and relations that influence women's and men's differential vulnerability to infection, exposure to pathogens, and treatment received, as well as how these may differ among different groups of women and men, are considered and addressed. We call on governments and global health institutions to consider the sex and gender effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, both direct and indirect, and conduct an analysis of the gendered impacts of the multiple outbreaks, incorporating the voices of women on the front line of the response to COVID-19 and of those most affected by the disease within preparedness and response policies or practices going forward. We declare no competing interests. Maintaining a gendered perspective in scientific meetings during the COVID-19 pandemicSeveral studies have pointed towards the COVID-19 pandemic's potential to negatively affect career paths of women in science.1,2 Although the impact on manuscript submissions and publications, as one career path mechanism, has been well documented,3 an area that is often difficult to elucidate as part of the mechanisms underlying differential progress of male and female researchers is that of invitations to give scientific talks and to chair scientific meetings.

GenomeScope 2.0 and Smudgeplot for reference-free profiling of polyploid genomes,"Abstract An important assessment prior to genome assembly and related analyses is genome profiling, where the k-mer frequencies within raw sequencing reads are analyzed to estimate major genome characteristics such as size, heterozygosity, and repetitiveness. Here we introduce GenomeScope 2.0 ( https://github.com/tbenavi1/genomescope2.0 ), which applies combinatorial theory to establish a detailed mathematical model of how k-mer frequencies are distributed in heterozygous and polyploid genomes. We describe and evaluate a practical implementation of the polyploid-aware mixture model that quickly and accurately infers genome properties across thousands of simulated and several real datasets spanning a broad range of complexity. We also present a method called Smudgeplot ( https://github.com/KamilSJaron/smudgeplot ) to visualize and estimate the ploidy and genome structure of a genome by analyzing heterozygous k-mer pairs. We successfully apply the approach to systems of known variable ploidy levels in the Meloidogyne genus and the extreme case of octoploid Fragaria × ananassa .","[""T.

In the realm of the Hubble tension—a review of solutions <sup>*</sup>,"Abstract The simplest ΛCDM model provides a good fit to a large span of cosmological data but harbors large areas of phenomenology and ignorance. With the improvement of the number and the accuracy of observations, discrepancies among key cosmological parameters of the model have emerged. The most statistically significant tension is the 4 σ to 6 σ disagreement between predictions of the Hubble constant, H 0 , made by the early time probes in concert with the ‘vanilla’ ΛCDM cosmological model, and a number of late time, model-independent determinations of H 0 from local measurements of distances and redshifts. The high precision and consistency of the data at both ends present strong challenges to the possible solution space and demands a hypothesis with enough rigor to explain multiple observations—whether these invoke new physics, unexpected large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors. A thorough review of the problem including a discussion of recent Hubble constant estimates and a summary of the proposed theoretical solutions is presented here. We include more than 1000 references, indicating that the interest in this area has grown considerably just during the last few years. We classify the many proposals to resolve the tension in these categories: early dark energy, late dark energy, dark energy models with 6 degrees of freedom and their extensions, models with extra relativistic degrees of freedom, models with extra interactions, unified cosmologies, modified gravity, inflationary models, modified recombination history, physics of the critical phenomena, and alternative proposals. Some are formally successful, improving the fit to the data in light of their additional degrees of freedom, restoring agreement within 1–2 σ between Planck 2018, using the cosmic microwave background power spectra data, baryon acoustic oscillations, Pantheon SN data, and R20, the latest SH0ES Team Riess, et al (2021 Astrophys. J. 908 L6) measurement of the Hubble constant ( H 0 = 73.2 ± 1.3 km s −1 Mpc −1 at 68% confidence level). However, there are many more unsuccessful models which leave the discrepancy well above the 3 σ disagreement level. In many cases, reduced tension comes not simply from a change in the value of H 0 but also due to an increase in its uncertainty due to degeneracy with additional physics, complicating the picture and pointing to the need for additional probes. While no specific proposal makes a strong case for being highly likely or far better than all others, solutions involving early or dynamical dark energy, neutrino interactions, interacting cosmologies, primordial magnetic fields, and modified gravity provide the best options until a better alternative comes along.","[""Eleonora Di Valentino"", ""Olga Mena"", ""Supriya Pan"", ""Luca Visinelli"", ""Weiqiang Yang"", ""A.

A Comprehensive Measurement of the Local Value of the Hubble Constant with 1 km s<sup>−1</sup> Mpc<sup>−1</sup> Uncertainty from the Hubble Space Telescope and the SH0ES Team,"We report observations from HST of Cepheids in the hosts of 42 SNe Ia used to calibrate the Hubble constant (H0). These include all suitable SNe Ia in the last 40 years at z<0.01, measured with >1000 orbits, more than doubling the sample whose size limits the precision of H0. The Cepheids are calibrated geometrically from Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, masers in N4258 (here tripling that Cepheid sample), and DEBs in the LMC. The Cepheids were measured with the same WFC3 instrument and filters (F555W, F814W, F160W) to negate zeropoint errors. We present multiple verifications of Cepheid photometry and tests of background determinations that show measurements are accurate in the presence of crowding. The SNe calibrate the mag-z relation from the new Pantheon+ compilation, accounting here for covariance between all SN data, with host properties and SN surveys matched to negate differences. We decrease the uncertainty in H0 to 1 km/s/Mpc with systematics. We present a comprehensive set of ~70 analysis variants to explore the sensitivity of H0 to selections of anchors, SN surveys, z range, variations in the analysis of dust, metallicity, form of the P-L relation, SN color, flows, sample bifurcations, and simultaneous measurement of H(z). Our baseline result from the Cepheid-SN sample is H0=73.04+-1.04 km/s/Mpc, which includes systematics and lies near the median of all analysis variants. We demonstrate consistency with measures from HST of the TRGB between SN hosts and NGC 4258 with Cepheids and together these yield 72.53+-0.99. Including high-z SN Ia we find H0=73.30+-1.04 with q0=-0.51+-0.024. We find a 5-sigma difference with H0 predicted by Planck+LCDM, with no indication this arises from measurement errors or analysis variations considered to date. The source of this now long-standing discrepancy between direct and cosmological routes to determining the Hubble constant remains unknown.","[""Adam G. Riess"", ""Wenlong Yuan"", ""Lucas M.

"Prevalence and Characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder Among Children Aged 8 Years — Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 11 Sites, United States, 2018","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).2018.The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network conducts active surveillance of ASD. This report focuses on the prevalence and characteristics of ASD among children aged 8 years in 2018 whose parents or guardians lived in 11 ADDM Network sites in the United States (Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin). To ascertain ASD among children aged 8 years, ADDM Network staff review and abstract developmental evaluations and records from community medical and educational service providers. In 2018, children met the case definition if their records documented 1) an ASD diagnostic statement in an evaluation (diagnosis), 2) a special education classification of ASD (eligibility), or 3) an ASD International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code.For 2018, across all 11 ADDM sites, ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 years ranged from 16.5 in Missouri to 38.9 in California. The overall ASD prevalence was 23.0 per 1,000 (one in 44) children aged 8 years, and ASD was 4.2 times as prevalent among boys as among girls. Overall ASD prevalence was similar across racial and ethnic groups, except American Indian/Alaska Native children had higher ASD prevalence than non-Hispanic White (White) children (29.0 versus 21.2 per 1,000 children aged 8 years). At multiple sites, Hispanic children had lower ASD prevalence than White children (Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, and Utah), and non-Hispanic Black (Black) children (Georgia and Minnesota). The associations between ASD prevalence and neighborhood-level median household income varied by site. Among the 5,058 children who met the ASD case definition, 75.8% had a diagnostic statement of ASD in an evaluation, 18.8% had an ASD special education classification or eligibility and no ASD diagnostic statement, and 5.4% had an ASD ICD code only. ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 years that was based exclusively on documented ASD diagnostic statements was 17.4 overall (range: 11.2 in Maryland to 29.9 in California). The median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis ranged from 36 months in California to 63 months in Minnesota. Among the 3,007 children with ASD and data on cognitive ability, 35.2% were classified as having an intelligence quotient (IQ) score ≤70. The percentages of children with ASD with IQ scores ≤70 were 49.8%, 33.1%, and 29.7% among Black, Hispanic, and White children, respectively. Overall, children with ASD and IQ scores ≤70 had earlier median ages of ASD diagnosis than children with ASD and IQ scores >70 (44 versus 53 months).In 2018, one in 44 children aged 8 years was estimated to have ASD, and prevalence and median age of identification varied widely across sites. Whereas overall ASD prevalence was similar by race and ethnicity, at certain sites Hispanic children were less likely to be identified as having ASD than White or Black children. The higher proportion of Black children compared with White and Hispanic children classified as having intellectual disability was consistent with previous findings.The variability in ASD prevalence and community ASD identification practices among children with different racial, ethnic, and geographical characteristics highlights the importance of research into the causes of that variability and strategies to provide equitable access to developmental evaluations and services. These findings also underscore the need for enhanced infrastructure for diagnostic, treatment, and support services to meet the needs of all children.","[""Matthew J.

New Creatinine- and Cystatin C–Based Equations to Estimate GFR without Race,"New Equations for Estimating GFR without Race Equations for estimating GFR with serum creatinine overestimate measured GFR in Blacks. The authors report new equations, without race as an inflation factor, using cystatin C and creatinine that reduced errors in estimation between Black participants and non-Black participants. Background Current equations for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that use serum creatinine or cystatin C incorporate age, sex, and race to estimate measured GFR. However, race in eGFR equations is a social and not a biologic construct. Methods We developed new eGFR equations without race using data from two development data sets: 10 studies (8254 participants, 31.5% Black) for serum creatinine and 13 studies (5352 participants, 39.7% Black) for both serum creatinine and cystatin C. In a validation data set of 12 studies (4050 participants, 14.3% Black), we compared the accuracy of new eGFR equations to measured GFR. We projected the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and GFR stages in a sample of U.S. adults, using current and new equations. Results In the validation data set, the current creatinine equation that uses age, sex, and race overestimated measured GFR in Blacks (median, 3.7 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 5.4) and to a lesser degree in non-Blacks (median, 0.5 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2); 95% CI, 0.0 to 0.9). When the adjustment for Black race was omitted from the current eGFR equation, measured GFR in Blacks was underestimated (median, 7.1 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2); 95% CI, 5.9 to 8.8). A new equation using age and sex and omitting race underestimated measured GFR in Blacks (median, 3.6 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2); 95% CI, 1.8 to 5.5) and overestimated measured GFR in non-Blacks (median, 3.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2); 95% CI, 3.4 to 4.4). For all equations, 85% or more of the eGFRs for Blacks and non-Blacks were within 30% of measured GFR. New creatinine-cystatin C equations without race were more accurate than new creatinine equations, with smaller differences between race groups. As compared with the current creatinine equation, the new creatinine equations, but not the new creatinine-cystatin C equations, increased population estimates of CKD prevalence among Blacks and yielded similar or lower prevalence among non-Blacks. Conclusions New eGFR equations that incorporate creatinine and cystatin C but omit race are more accurate and led to smaller differences between Black participants and non-Black participants than new equations without race with either creatinine or cystatin C alone.

Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models,"We study empirical scaling laws for language model performance on the cross-entropy loss. The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.","[""Jared Kaplan"", ""Sam McCandlish"", ""Tom Henighan"", ""T.

Social Determinants of Health and Diabetes: A Scientific Review,"Decades of research have demonstrated that diabetes affects racial and ethnic minority and low-income adult populations in the U.S. disproportionately, with relatively intractable patterns seen in these populations’ higher risk of diabetes and rates of diabetes complications and mortality (1). With a health care shift toward greater emphasis on population health outcomes and value-based care, social determinants of health (SDOH) have risen to the forefront as essential intervention targets to achieve health equity (2–4). Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted unequal vulnerabilities borne by racial and ethnic minority groups and by disadvantaged communities. In the wake of concurrent pandemic and racial injustice events in the U.S., the American College of Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, Society of General Internal Medicine, National Academy of Medicine, and other professional organizations have published statements on SDOH (5–8), and calls to action focus on amelioration of these determinants at individual, organizational, and policy levels (9–11).

In diabetes, understanding and mitigating the impact of SDOH are priorities due to disease prevalence, economic costs, and disproportionate population burden (12–14). In 2013, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) published a scientific statement on socioecological determinants of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (15). Toward the goal ofunderstanding and advancing opportunities for health improvement among the population with diabetes through addressing SDOH, ADA convened the current SDOH and diabetes writing committee, prepandemic, to review the literature on 1 ) associations of SDOH with diabetes risk and outcomes and 2 ) impact of interventions targeting amelioration of SDOH on diabetes outcomes. This article begins with an overview of key definitions and SDOH frameworks. The literature review focuses primarily on U.S.-based studies of adults with diabetes and on five SDOH: socioeconomic status (education, income, occupation); neighborhood and physical environment (housing, built environment, toxic environmental …","[""Felicia Hill\u2010Briggs"", ""Nancy E.

Age-specific mortality and immunity patterns of SARS-CoV-2,"Estimating the size of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the infection severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is made challenging by inconsistencies in the available data. The number of deaths associated with COVID-19 is often used as a key indicator for the size of the epidemic, but the observed number of deaths represents only a minority of all infections1,2. In addition, the heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes and the variable reporting of deaths of older individuals can hinder direct comparisons of mortality rates and the underlying levels of transmission across countries3. Here we use age-specific COVID-19-associated death data from 45 countries and the results of 22 seroprevalence studies to investigate the consistency of infection and fatality patterns across multiple countries. We find that the age distribution of deaths in younger age groups (less than 65 years of age) is very consistent across different settings and demonstrate how these data can provide robust estimates of the share of the population that has been infected. We estimate that the infection fatality ratio is lowest among 5–9-year-old children, with a log-linear increase by age among individuals older than 30 years. Population age structures and heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes explain some but not all of the heterogeneity between countries in infection fatality ratios. Among the 45 countries included in our analysis, we estimate that approximately 5% of these populations had been infected by 1 September 2020, and that much higher transmission rates have probably occurred in a number of Latin American countries. This simple modelling framework can help countries to assess the progression of the pandemic and can be applied in any scenario for which reliable age-specific death data are available. The relative risk of COVID-19-associated death for younger individuals (under 65) is consistent across countries and can be used to robustly compare the underlying number of infections in each country.","[""Megan O\u2019Driscoll"", ""Gabriel Ribeiro dos Santos"", ""Lin Wang"", ""Derek A.

Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor Testing in Breast Cancer: ASCO/CAP Guideline Update,"PURPOSE To update key recommendations of the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) testing in breast cancer guideline. METHODS A multidisciplinary international Expert Panel was convened to update the clinical practice guideline recommendations informed by a systematic review of the medical literature. RECOMMENDATIONS The Expert Panel continues to recommend ER testing of invasive breast cancers by validated immunohistochemistry as the standard for predicting which patients may benefit from endocrine therapy, and no other assays are recommended for this purpose. Breast cancer samples with 1% to 100% of tumor nuclei positive should be interpreted as ER positive. However, the Expert Panel acknowledges that there are limited data on endocrine therapy benefit for cancers with 1% to 10% of cells staining ER positive. Samples with these results should be reported using a new reporting category, ER Low Positive, with a recommended comment. A sample is considered ER negative if &lt; 1% or 0% of tumor cell nuclei are immunoreactive. Additional strategies recommended to promote optimal performance, interpretation, and reporting of cases with an initial low to no ER staining result include establishing a laboratory-specific standard operating procedure describing additional steps used by the laboratory to confirm/adjudicate results. The status of controls should be reported for cases with 0% to 10% staining. Similar principles apply to PgR testing, which is used primarily for prognostic purposes in the setting of an ER-positive cancer. Testing of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) for ER is recommended to determine potential benefit of endocrine therapies to reduce risk of future breast cancer, while testing DCIS for PgR is considered optional.

Estimating the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in France,"France has been heavily affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and went into lockdown on 17 March 2020. Using models applied to hospital and death data, we estimate the impact of the lockdown and current population immunity. We find that 2.9% of infected individuals are hospitalized and 0.5% of those infected die (95% credible interval: 0.3 to 0.9%), ranging from 0.001% in those under 20 years of age to 8.3% in those 80 years of age or older. Across all ages, men are more likely to be hospitalized, enter intensive care, and die than women. The lockdown reduced the reproductive number from 2.90 to 0.67 (77% reduction). By 11 May 2020, when interventions are scheduled to be eased, we project that 3.5 million people (range: 2.1 million to 6.0 million), or 5.3% of the population (range: 3.3 to 9.3%), will have been infected. Population immunity appears to be insufficient to avoid a second wave if all control measures are released at the end of the lockdown.","[""Henrik Salje"", ""C\u00e9cile Tran Kiem"", ""No\u00e9mie Lefrancq"", ""No\u00e9mie Courtejoie"", ""Paolo Bosetti"", ""Juliette Paireau"", ""Alessio Andronico"", ""Nathana\u00ebl Hoz\u00e9"", ""Jehanne Richet"", ""Claire-Lise Dubost"", ""Yann Le Strat"", ""Justin Lessler"", ""D L\u00e9vy-Br\u00fchl"", ""Arnaud Fontanet"", ""Lulla Opatowski"", ""Pi\u00e9rre-Yves Bo\u00eblle"", ""Simon Cauchemez""]",2020-05-13,University of Melbourne,https://openalex.org/W3025090814,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abc3517,"[""Pandemic"", ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"", ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"", ""Medicine"", ""Population"", ""Herd immunity"", ""Demography"", ""2019-20 coronavirus outbreak"", ""Intensive care"", ""Coronavirus""]",Science,1118,https://openalex.org/W3025090814
"Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Geneva, Switzerland (SEROCoV-POP): a population-based study","BackgroundAssessing the burden of COVID-19 on the basis of medically attended case numbers is suboptimal given its reliance on testing strategy, changing case definitions, and disease presentation. Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) antibodies provide one method for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic. Here, we estimate weekly seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of Geneva, Switzerland, during the epidemic.MethodsThe SEROCoV-POP study is a population-based study of former participants of the Bus Santé study and their household members. We planned a series of 12 consecutive weekly serosurveys among randomly selected participants from a previous population-representative survey, and their household members aged 5 years and older. We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available ELISA. We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian logistic regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva's population. Here we present results from the first 5 weeks of the study.FindingsBetween April 6 and May 9, 2020, we enrolled 2766 participants from 1339 households, with a demographic distribution similar to that of the canton of Geneva. In the first week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 4·8% (95% CI 2·4–8·0, n=341). The estimate increased to 8·5% (5·9–11·4, n=469) in the second week, to 10·9% (7·9–14·4, n=577) in the third week, 6·6% (4·3–9·4, n=604) in the fourth week, and 10·8% (8·2–13·9, n=775) in the fifth week. Individuals aged 5–9 years (relative risk [RR] 0·32 [95% CI 0·11–0·63]) and those older than 65 years (RR 0·50 [0·28–0·78]) had a significantly lower risk of being seropositive than those aged 20–49 years. After accounting for the time to seroconversion, we estimated that for every reported confirmed case, there were 11·6 infections in the community.InterpretationThese results suggest that most of the population of Geneva remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the region (5000 reported clinical cases over <2·5 months in the population of half a million people). Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from coming to an end by means of fewer susceptible people in the population. Further, a significantly lower seroprevalence was observed for children aged 5–9 years and adults older than 65 years, compared with those aged 10–64 years. These results will inform countries considering the easing of restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.FundingSwiss Federal Office of Public Health, Swiss School of Public Health (Corona Immunitas research program), Fondation de Bienfaisance du Groupe Pictet, Fondation Ancrage, Fondation Privée des Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève, and Center for Emerging Viral Diseases.","[""Silvia Stringhini"", ""Ania Wisniak"", ""Giovanni Piumatti"", ""Andrew S.

The Lancet Global Health Commission on Global Eye Health: vision beyond 2020,"Eye health and vision have widespread and profound implications for many aspects of life, health, sustainable development, and the economy. Yet nowadays, many people, families, and populations continue to suffer the consequences of poor access to high-quality, affordable eye care, leading to vision impairment and blindness. In 2020, an estimated 596 million people had distance vision impairment worldwide, of whom 43 million were blind. Another 510 million people had uncorrected near vision impairment, simply because of not having reading spectacles. A large proportion of those affected (90%), live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, encouragingly, more than 90% of people with vision impairment have a preventable or treatable cause with existing highly cost-effective interventions. Eye conditions affect all stages of life, with young children and older people being particularly affected. Crucially, women, rural populations, and ethnic minority groups are more likely to have vision impairment, and this pervasive inequality needs to be addressed. By 2050, population ageing, growth, and urbanisation might lead to an estimated 895 million people with distance vision impairment, of whom 61 million will be blind. Action to prioritise eye health is needed now. This Commission defines eye health as maximised vision, ocular health, and functional ability, thereby contributing to overall health and wellbeing, social inclusion, and quality of life. Eye health is essential to achieve many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Poor eye health and impaired vision have a negative effect on quality of life and restrict equitable access to and achievement in education and the workplace. Vision loss has substantial financial implications for affected individuals, families, and communities. Although high-quality data for global economic estimates are scarce, particularly for LMICs, conservative assessments based on the latest prevalence figures for 2020 suggest that annual global productivity loss from vision impairment is approximately US$410·7 billion purchasing power parity. Vision impairment reduces mobility, affects mental wellbeing, exacerbates risk of dementia, increases likelihood of falls and road traffic crashes, increases the need for social care, and ultimately leads to higher mortality rates. By contrast, vision facilitates many daily life activities, enables better educational outcomes, and increases work productivity, reducing inequality. An increasing amount of evidence shows the potential for vision to advance the SDGs, by contributing towards poverty reduction, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, quality education, gender equality, and decent work. Eye health is a global public priority, transforming lives in both poor and wealthy communities. Therefore, eye health needs to be reframed as a development as well as a health issue and given greater prominence within the global development and health agendas. Vision loss has many causes that require promotional, preventive, treatment, and rehabilitative interventions. Cataract, uncorrected refractive error, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy are responsible for most global vision impairment. Research has identified treatments to reduce or eliminate blindness from all these conditions; the priority is to deliver treatments where they are most needed. Proven eye care interventions, such as cataract surgery and spectacle provision, are among the most cost-effective in all of health care. Greater financial investment is needed so that millions of people living with unnecessary vision impairment and blindness can benefit from these interventions. Lessons from the past three decades give hope that this challenge can be met. Between 1990 and 2020, the age-standardised global prevalence of blindness fell by 28·5%. Since the 1990s, prevalence of major infectious causes of blindness—onchocerciasis and trachoma—have declined substantially. Hope remains that by 2030, the transmission of onchocerciasis will be interrupted, and trachoma will be eliminated as a public health problem in every country worldwide. However, the ageing population has led to a higher crude prevalence of age-related causes of blindness, and thus an increased total number of people with blindness in some regions. Key messagesEye health is essential to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; vision needs to be reframed as a development issueThere is extensive evidence showing that improving eye health contributes directly and indirectly to achieving many Sustainable Development Goals, including reducing poverty and improving work productivity, general and mental health, and education and equity. Improving eye health is a practical and cost-effective way of unlocking human potential. Eye health needs to be reframed as an enabling, cross-cutting issue within the sustainable development framework.Almost everyone will experience impaired vision or an eye condition during their lifetime and require eye care services; urgent action is necessary to meet the rapidly growing eye health needIn 2020, 1·1 billion people had distance vision impairment or uncorrected presbyopia. By 2050, this figure is expected to rise to 1·8 billion. Most affected people live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) with avoidable causes of vision impairment. During the life course, most people will experience vision impairment, even if just the need for reading glasses. Because of unmet needs and an ageing global population, eye health is a major public health and sustainable development concern which warrants urgent political action.Eye health is an essential component of universal health coverage; it must be included in planning, resourcing, and delivery of health careUniversal health coverage is not universal without affordable, high quality, equitable eye care. In line with the WHO World report on vision, we urge countries to consider eye care as an essential service within universal health coverage. To deliver comprehensive services including promotion, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation, eye care needs to be included in national strategic health plans and development policies, health financing structures, and health workforce planning. Coordinated intersectoral action is needed to systematically improve population eye health, also within healthy ageing initiatives, schools, and the workplace. Integration of eye health services with multiple relevant components of health service delivery and at all levels of the health system is of central importance.High quality eye health services are not universally delivered; concerted action is needed to improve quality and outcomes, providing effective, efficient, safe, timely, equitable, and people-centred careUse of effective service coverage indicators for cataract and refractive error highlight the delivery gap between population eye health needs and the delivery of good outcomes. We urge eye health providers to take a holistic view to emphasise quality and design service delivery based on individual and population needs: a people-centred approach. Services need to be characterised by inclusiveness and equity in design and delivery, proactively addressing the needs of marginalised and vulnerable groups through targeted interventions. To encourage improved quality in cataract surgery, we support redefining a good vision outcome threshold as 6/12 or better.Highly cost-effective vision-restoring interventions offer enormous potential to improve the economic outlook of individuals and nations; a major scale up of financial investment in eye health is requiredFor 2020, we estimate that vision impairment resulted in $410·7 billion lost economic productivity; the full cost is most likely higher. Treatments for cataract and refractive error would meet more than 90% of unmet needs and are highly cost-effective. The case for countries to invest in improving population eye health is compelling and more financial resources are urgently required.Financial barriers to accessing eye care leave many people behind; eye health needs to be included in national health financing to pool the riskHealth-care costs prevent many people from accessing essential eye health services. Eye care needs to be integrated into general health system financing to remove cost barriers. To improve access for the whole population and mitigate eye care expenditure, mechanisms that pool risk are highly desirable.Technology and treatment developments offer new tools to improve eye health; thoughtful application is needed to maximise the potential to improve coverage, accessibility, quality, efficiency, and affordabilityTechnological developments such as telemedicine, mHealth, and artificial intelligence offer the potential to revolutionise eye health care in the next decade by delivering affordable, high-quality services to remote areas. However, caution is needed to ensure all populations benefit from these developments.The eye health workforce is unable to meet population needs in many countries; major expansion in service capacity is required through increased numbers, sharing tasks, strengthened training, enabling work environments, and effective leadershipMany areas have major shortages of personnel working in eye health. The available workforce needs to be distributed according to population need. Quality of training for the workforce needs to be updated, with renewed emphasis on competency. Enabling working environments need to be created, including appropriate support, supervision, and equipment. Long-standing issues of low productivity need to be systematically resolved. Mentoring and other programmes to cultivate an emerging generation of eye health leaders are needed.Reliable survey and service data are key to progress in eye health; robust indicator data are needed to shape change and drive actionTo monitor progress in delivering improved eye health within universal health coverage, a balanced set of robust indicators are needed, which we outlined in this Commission. Service data should be available and used by implementers and policy makers to drive change. We highlight the scarcity of epidemiological data in several regions, which should be addressed as a priority.Research has been crucial to advances in understanding and treating eye disease; solution-focused, contextually relevant research is urgently needed to deliver innovative prevention and treatment strategies and inform implementation of eye health within universal health coverageImplementation research is needed, particularly in LMICs, to guide effective delivery of services within universal health coverage. Discovery research is needed for specific areas that remain without efficacious interventions. The economic impact of vision impairment, and the costs and benefits of interventions are only partly understood; a coordinated global effort to systematically collect data is needed. A step-change in the capacity of LMICs to do contextually relevant eye health research and a greater commitment are needed to improve diversity and inclusion in the research community.

During the life course, most people will experience vision impairment, even if just the need for reading glasses. Because of unmet needs and an ageing global population, eye health is a major public health and sustainable development concern which warrants urgent political action. Eye health is an essential component of universal health coverage; it must be included in planning, resourcing, and delivery of health care Universal health coverage is not universal without affordable, high quality, equitable eye care. In line with the WHO World report on vision, we urge countries to consider eye care as an essential service within universal health coverage. To deliver comprehensive services including promotion, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation, eye care needs to be included in national strategic health plans and development policies, health financing structures, and health workforce planning. Coordinated intersectoral action is needed to systematically improve population eye health, also within healthy ageing initiatives, schools, and the workplace. Integration of eye health services with multiple relevant components of health service delivery and at all levels of the health system is of central importance. High quality eye health services are not universally delivered; concerted action is needed to improve quality and outcomes, providing effective, efficient, safe, timely, equitable, and people-centred care Use of effective service coverage indicators for cataract and refractive error highlight the delivery gap between population eye health needs and the delivery of good outcomes. We urge eye health providers to take a holistic view to emphasise quality and design service delivery based on individual and population needs: a people-centred approach. Services need to be characterised by inclusiveness and equity in design and delivery, proactively addressing the needs of marginalised and vulnerable groups through targeted interventions. To encourage improved quality in cataract surgery, we support redefining a good vision outcome threshold as 6/12 or better. Highly cost-effective vision-restoring interventions offer enormous potential to improve the economic outlook of individuals and nations; a major scale up of financial investment in eye health is required For 2020, we estimate that vision impairment resulted in $410·7 billion lost economic productivity; the full cost is most likely higher. Treatments for cataract and refractive error would meet more than 90% of unmet needs and are highly cost-effective. The case for countries to invest in improving population eye health is compelling and more financial resources are urgently required. Financial barriers to accessing eye care leave many people behind; eye health needs to be included in national health financing to pool the risk Health-care costs prevent many people from accessing essential eye health services. Eye care needs to be integrated into general health system financing to remove cost barriers. To improve access for the whole population and mitigate eye care expenditure, mechanisms that pool risk are highly desirable. Technology and treatment developments offer new tools to improve eye health; thoughtful application is needed to maximise the potential to improve coverage, accessibility, quality, efficiency, and affordability Technological developments such as telemedicine, mHealth, and artificial intelligence offer the potential to revolutionise eye health care in the next decade by delivering affordable, high-quality services to remote areas. However, caution is needed to ensure all populations benefit from these developments. The eye health workforce is unable to meet population needs in many countries; major expansion in service capacity is required through increased numbers, sharing tasks, strengthened training, enabling work environments, and effective leadership Many areas have major shortages of personnel working in eye health. The available workforce needs to be distributed according to population need. Quality of training for the workforce needs to be updated, with renewed emphasis on competency. Enabling working environments need to be created, including appropriate support, supervision, and equipment. Long-standing issues of low productivity need to be systematically resolved. Mentoring and other programmes to cultivate an emerging generation of eye health leaders are needed. Reliable survey and service data are key to progress in eye health; robust indicator data are needed to shape change and drive action To monitor progress in delivering improved eye health within universal health coverage, a balanced set of robust indicators are needed, which we outlined in this Commission. Service data should be available and used by implementers and policy makers to drive change. We highlight the scarcity of epidemiological data in several regions, which should be addressed as a priority. Research has been crucial to advances in understanding and treating eye disease; solution-focused, contextually relevant research is urgently needed to deliver innovative prevention and treatment strategies and inform implementation of eye health within universal health coverage Implementation research is needed, particularly in LMICs, to guide effective delivery of services within universal health coverage. Discovery research is needed for specific areas that remain without efficacious interventions. The economic impact of vision impairment, and the costs and benefits of interventions are only partly understood; a coordinated global effort to systematically collect data is needed. A step-change in the capacity of LMICs to do contextually relevant eye health research and a greater commitment are needed to improve diversity and inclusion in the research community. Despite this progress, business as usual will not keep pace with the demographic trends of an ageing global population or address the inequities that persist in each country. New threats to eye health are emerging, including the worldwide increase in diabetic retinopathy, high myopia, retinopathy of prematurity, and chronic eye diseases of ageing such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. With the projected increase in such conditions and their associated vision loss over the coming decades, urgent action is needed to develop innovative treatments and deliver services at a greater scale than previously achieved. Good eye health at the community and national level has been marginalised as a luxury available to only wealthy or urban areas. Eye health needs to be urgently brought into the mainstream of national health and development policy, planning, financing, and action. The challenge is to develop and deliver comprehensive eye health services (promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation) that address the full range of eye conditions within the context of universal health coverage. Accessing services should not bring the risk of falling into poverty and services should be of high quality, as envisaged by the WHO framework for health-care quality: effective, safe, people-centred, timely, equitable, integrated, and efficient. To this framework we add the need for services to be environmentally sustainable. Universal health coverage is not universal without eye care. Multiple obstacles need to be overcome to achieve universal coverage for eye health. Important issues include complex barriers to availability and access to quality services, cost, major shortages and maldistribution of well-trained personnel, and lack of suitable, well maintained equipment and consumables. These issues are particularly widespread in LMICs, but also occur in underserved communities in high-income countries. Strong partnerships need to be formed with natural allies working in areas affected by eye health, such as non-communicable diseases, neglected tropical diseases, healthy ageing, children's services, education, disability, and rehabilitation. The eye health sector has traditionally focused on treatment and rehabilitation, and underused health promotion and prevention strategies to lessen the impact of eye disease and reduce inequality. Solving these problems will depend on solutions established from high quality evidence that can guide more effective implementation at scale. Evidence-based approaches will need to address existing deficiencies in the supply and demand. Strategic investments in discovery research, harnessing new findings from diverse fields, and implementation research to guide effective scale up are needed globally. Encouragingly, developments in telemedicine, mobile health, artificial intelligence, and distance learning could potentially enable eye care professionals to deliver higher quality care that is more plentiful, equitable, and cost-effective. This Commission did a Grand Challenges in Global Eye Health prioritisation exercise to highlight key areas for concerted research and action. This exercise has identified a broad set of challenges spanning the fields of epidemiology, health systems, diagnostics, therapeutics, and implementation. The most compelling of these issues, picked from among 3400 suggestions proposed by 336 people from 118 countries, can help to frame the future research agenda for global eye health. In this Commission, we harness lessons learned from over two decades, present the growing evidence for the life-transforming impact of eye care, and provide a thorough understanding of rapid developments in the field. This report was created through a broad consultation involving experts within and outside the eye care sector to help inform governments and other stakeholders about the path forward for eye health beyond 2020, to further the SDGs (including universal health coverage), and work towards a world without avoidable vision loss. The next few years are a crucial time for the global eye health community and its partners in health care, government, and other sectors to consider the successes and challenges encountered in the past two decades, and at the same time to chart a way forward for the upcoming decades. Moving forward requires building on the strong foundation laid by WHO and partners in VISION 2020 with renewed impetus to ultimately deliver high quality universal eye health care for all.","[""Matthew J.

PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling transduction pathway and targeted therapies in cancer,"Abstract The PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) signaling pathway is a highly conserved signal transduction network in eukaryotic cells that promotes cell survival, cell growth, and cell cycle progression. Growth factor signalling to transcription factors in the PAM axis is highly regulated by multiple cross-interactions with several other signaling pathways, and dysregulation of signal transduction can predispose to cancer development. The PAM axis is the most frequently activated signaling pathway in human cancer and is often implicated in resistance to anticancer therapies. Dysfunction of components of this pathway such as hyperactivity of PI3K, loss of function of PTEN, and gain-of-function of AKT, are notorious drivers of treatment resistance and disease progression in cancer. In this review we highlight the major dysregulations in the PAM signaling pathway in cancer, and discuss the results of PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors as monotherapy and in co-administation with other antineoplastic agents in clinical trials as a strategy for overcoming treatment resistance. Finally, the major mechanisms of resistance to PAM signaling targeted therapies, including PAM signaling in immunology and immunotherapies are also discussed.","[""Antonino Glaviano"", ""Aaron Song Chuan Foo"", ""Hiu Yan Lam"", ""Kenneth Chun-Yong Yap"", ""William Jacot"", ""Robert H.

Diagnosis and Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"<h3>Importance</h3> Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects 17% of women and 34% of men in the US and has a similar prevalence in other countries. This review provides an update on the diagnosis and treatment of OSA. <h3>Observations</h3> The most common presenting symptom of OSA is excessive sleepiness, although this symptom is reported by as few as 15% to 50% of people with OSA in the general population. OSA is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. In many patients, OSA can be diagnosed with home sleep apnea testing, which has a sensitivity of approximately 80%. Effective treatments include weight loss and exercise, positive airway pressure, oral appliances that hold the jaw forward during sleep, and surgical modification of the pharyngeal soft tissues or facial skeleton to enlarge the upper airway. Hypoglossal nerve stimulation is effective in select patients with a body mass index less than 32. There are currently no effective pharmacological therapies. Treatment with positive airway pressure lowers blood pressure, especially in patients with resistant hypertension; however, randomized clinical trials of OSA treatment have not demonstrated significant benefit on rates of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> OSA is common and the prevalence is increasing with the increased prevalence of obesity. Daytime sleepiness is among the most common symptoms, but many patients with OSA are asymptomatic. Patients with OSA who are asymptomatic, or whose symptoms are minimally bothersome and pose no apparent risk to driving safety, can be treated with behavioral measures, such as weight loss and exercise. Interventions such as positive airway pressure are recommended for those with excessive sleepiness and resistant hypertension. Managing asymptomatic OSA to reduce cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events is not currently supported by high-quality evidence.","[""Daniel J. Gottlieb"", ""Naresh M.

Effects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy on Major Depressive Disorder,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a substantial public health burden, but current treatments have limited effectiveness and adherence. Recent evidence suggests that 1 or 2 administrations of psilocybin with psychological support produces antidepressant effects in patients with cancer and in those with treatment-resistant depression.To investigate the effect of psilocybin therapy in patients with MDD.This randomized, waiting list-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Adults aged 21 to 75 years with an MDD diagnosis, not currently using antidepressant medications, and without histories of psychotic disorder, serious suicide attempt, or hospitalization were eligible to participate. Enrollment occurred between August 2017 and April 2019, and the 4-week primary outcome assessments were completed in July 2019. A total of 27 participants were randomized to an immediate treatment condition group (n = 15) or delayed treatment condition group (waiting list control condition; n = 12). Data analysis was conducted from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, and included participants who completed the intervention (evaluable population).Two psilocybin sessions (session 1: 20 mg/70 kg; session 2: 30 mg/70 kg) were given (administered in opaque gelatin capsules with approximately 100 mL of water) in the context of supportive psychotherapy (approximately 11 hours). Participants were randomized to begin treatment immediately or after an 8-week delay.The primary outcome, depression severity was assessed with the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) scores at baseline (score of ≥17 required for enrollment) and weeks 5 and 8 after enrollment for the delayed treatment group, which corresponded to weeks 1 and 4 after the intervention for the immediate treatment group. Secondary outcomes included the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated (QIDS-SR).Of the randomized participants, 24 of 27 (89%) completed the intervention and the week 1 and week 4 postsession assessments. This population had a mean (SD) age of 39.8 (12.2) years, was composed of 16 women (67%), and had a mean (SD) baseline GRID-HAMD score of 22.8 (3.9). The mean (SD) GRID-HAMD scores at weeks 1 and 4 (8.0 [7.1] and 8.5 [5.7]) in the immediate treatment group were statistically significantly lower than the scores at the comparable time points of weeks 5 and 8 (23.8 [5.4] and 23.5 [6.0]) in the delayed treatment group. The effect sizes were large at week 5 (Cohen d = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-3.5; P < .001) and week 8 (Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-3.7; P < .001). The QIDS-SR documented a rapid decrease in mean (SD) depression score from baseline to day 1 after session 1 (16.7 [3.5] vs 6.3 [4.4]; Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.8-3.5; P < .001), which remained statistically significantly reduced through the week 4 follow-up (6.0 [5.7]; Cohen d = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5-3.0; P < .001). In the overall sample, 17 participants (71%) at week 1 and 17 (71%) at week 4 had a clinically significant response to the intervention (≥50% reduction in GRID-HAMD score), and 14 participants (58%) at week 1 and 13 participants (54%) at week 4 were in remission (≤7 GRID-HAMD score).Findings suggest that psilocybin with therapy is efficacious in treating MDD, thus extending the results of previous studies of this intervention in patients with cancer and depression and of a nonrandomized study in patients with treatment-resistant depression.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03181529.","[""Alan K.

Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients With COVID-19 (April 2020),"Abstract Background There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a need for frequently updated practice guidelines on their use, based on critical evaluation of rapidly emerging literature. The objective was to develop evidence-based rapid guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. Methods The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise. Process followed a rapid recommendation checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. Then a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and gray literature was conducted. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. Results The IDSA guideline panel agreed on 7 treatment recommendations and provided narrative summaries of other treatments undergoing evaluations. Conclusions The panel expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials, which would provide much-needed evidence on the efficacy and safety of various therapies for COVID-19, given that we could not make a determination whether the benefits outweigh harms for most treatments.","[""Adarsh Bhimraj"", ""Rebecca L.

The Human Phenotype Ontology in 2021,"Abstract The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO, https://hpo.jax.org) was launched in 2008 to provide a comprehensive logical standard to describe and computationally analyze phenotypic abnormalities found in human disease. The HPO is now a worldwide standard for phenotype exchange. The HPO has grown steadily since its inception due to considerable contributions from clinical experts and researchers from a diverse range of disciplines. Here, we present recent major extensions of the HPO for neurology, nephrology, immunology, pulmonology, newborn screening, and other areas. For example, the seizure subontology now reflects the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) guidelines and these enhancements have already shown clinical validity. We present new efforts to harmonize computational definitions of phenotypic abnormalities across the HPO and multiple phenotype ontologies used for animal models of disease. These efforts will benefit software such as Exomiser by improving the accuracy and scope of cross-species phenotype matching. The computational modeling strategy used by the HPO to define disease entities and phenotypic features and distinguish between them is explained in detail.We also report on recent efforts to translate the HPO into indigenous languages. Finally, we summarize recent advances in the use of HPO in electronic health record systems.","[""Sebastian K\u00f6hler"", ""Michael Gargano"", ""Nicolas Matentzoglu"", ""Leigh Carmody"", ""David Lewis\u2010Smith"", ""Nicole Vasilevsky"", ""Daniel Dani\u0161"", ""Ganna Balagura"", ""Gareth Baynam"", ""Amy Brower"", ""Tiffany J Callahan"", ""Christopher G.

2021 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Objective To develop updated guidelines for the pharmacologic management of rheumatoid arthritis. Methods We developed clinically relevant population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions. After conducting a systematic literature review, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence. A voting panel comprising clinicians and patients achieved consensus on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of recommendations. Results The guideline addresses treatment with disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including conventional synthetic DMARDs, biologic DMARDs, and targeted synthetic DMARDs, use of glucocorticoids, and use of DMARDs in certain high‐risk populations (i.e., those with liver disease, heart failure, lymphoproliferative disorders, previous serious infections, and nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease). The guideline includes 44 recommendations (7 strong and 37 conditional). Conclusion This clinical practice guideline is intended to serve as a tool to support clinician and patient decision‐making. Recommendations are not prescriptive, and individual treatment decisions should be made through a shared decision‐making process based on patients’ values, goals, preferences, and comorbidities.","[""Liana Fraenkel"", ""Joan M.

Outcomes of Observation vs Stereotactic Ablative Radiation for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer,"Complete metastatic ablation of oligometastatic prostate cancer may provide an alternative to early initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).To determine if stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) improves oncologic outcomes in men with oligometastatic prostate cancer.The Observation vs Stereotactic Ablative Radiation for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer (ORIOLE) phase 2 randomized study accrued participants from 3 US radiation treatment facilities affiliated with a university hospital from May 2016 to March 2018 with a data cutoff date of May 20, 2019, for analysis. Of 80 men screened, 54 men with recurrent hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and 1 to 3 metastases detectable by conventional imaging who had not received ADT within 6 months of enrollment or 3 or more years total were randomized.Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive SABR or observation.The primary outcome was progression at 6 months by prostate-specific antigen level increase, progression detected by conventional imaging, symptomatic progression, ADT initiation for any reason, or death. Predefined secondary outcomes were toxic effects of SABR, local control at 6 months with SABR, progression-free survival, Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form)-measured quality of life, and concordance between conventional imaging and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted positron emission tomography in the identification of metastatic disease.In the 54 men randomized, the median (range) age was 68 (61-70) years for patients allocated to SABR and 68 (64-76) years for those allocated to observation. Progression at 6 months occurred in 7 of 36 patients (19%) receiving SABR and 11 of 18 patients (61%) undergoing observation (P = .005). Treatment with SABR improved median progression-free survival (not reached vs 5.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11-0.81; P = .002). Total consolidation of PSMA radiotracer-avid disease decreased the risk of new lesions at 6 months (16% vs 63%; P = .006). No toxic effects of grade 3 or greater were observed. T-cell receptor sequencing identified significant increased clonotypic expansion following SABR and correlation between baseline clonality and progression with SABR only (0.082085 vs 0.026051; P = .03).Treatment with SABR for oligometastatic prostate cancer improved outcomes and was enhanced by total consolidation of disease identified by PSMA-targeted positron emission tomography. SABR induced a systemic immune response, and baseline immune phenotype and tumor mutation status may predict the benefit from SABR. These results underline the importance of prospective randomized investigation of the oligometastatic state with integrated imaging and biological correlates.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02680587.","[""Ryan Phillips"", ""William Y.

Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccination during the COVID-19 Pandemic in China,"Background: Faced with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the development of COVID-19 vaccines has been progressing at an unprecedented rate. This study aimed to evaluate the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in China and give suggestions for vaccination strategies and immunization programs accordingly. Methods: In March 2020, an anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted online among Chinese adults. The questionnaire collected socio-demographic characteristics, risk perception, the impact of COVID-19, attitudes, acceptance and attribute preferences of vaccines against COVID-19 during the pandemic. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the influencing factors of vaccination acceptance. Results: Of the 2058 participants surveyed, 1879 (91.3%) stated that they would accept COVID-19 vaccination after the vaccine becomes available, among whom 980 (52.2%) wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible, while others (47.8%) would delay the vaccination until the vaccine’s safety was confirmed. Participants preferred a routine immunization schedule (49.4%) to emergency vaccination (9.0%) or either of them (41.6%). Logistic regression showed that being male, being married, perceiving a high risk of infection, being vaccinated against influenza in the past season, believing in the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination or valuing doctor’s recommendations could increase the probability of accepting COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible, while having confirmed or suspected cases in local areas, valuing vaccination convenience or vaccine price in decision-making could hinder participants from immediate vaccination. Conclusion: During the pandemic period, a strong demand for and high acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination has been shown among the Chinese population, while concerns about vaccine safety may hinder the promotion of vaccine uptake. To expand vaccination coverage, immunization programs should be designed to remove barriers in terms of vaccine price and vaccination convenience, and health education and communication from authoritative sources are important ways to alleviate public concerns about vaccine safety.","[""Jiahao Wang"", ""Rize Jing"", ""Xiaozhen Lai"", ""Haijun Zhang"", ""Yun Lyu"", ""Maria Deloria Knoll"", ""Hai Fang""]",2020-08-27,University of Melbourne,https://openalex.org/W3080350053,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8030482,"[""Vaccination"", ""Pandemic"", ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"", ""Logistic regression"", ""Medicine"", ""Immunization"", ""Demography"", ""Environmental health"", ""Family medicine"", ""Disease""]",Vaccines,958,https://openalex.org/W3080350053
The convalescent sera option for containing COVID-19,"As of early 2020, humanity is confronting a pandemic in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease, abbreviated as COVID-19.At the time of this writing, SARS-CoV-2 is spreading in multiple countries, threatening a pandemic that will affect billions of people.This virus appears to be a new human pathogen.Currently there are no vaccines, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), or drugs available for SARS-CoV-2, although many are in rapid development and some may be available in a short time.This Viewpoint argues that human convalescent serum is an option for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease that could be rapidly available when there are sufficient numbers of people who have recovered and can donate immunoglobulin-containing serum.","[""Arturo Casadevall"", ""Liise\u2010anne Pirofski""]",2020-03-13,University of Melbourne,https://openalex.org/W3011379523,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci138003,"[""Pandemic"", ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"", ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"", ""Virology"", ""2019-20 coronavirus outbreak"", ""Coronavirus"", ""Monoclonal antibody"", ""Convalescent plasma"", ""Immunology"", ""Antibody""]",Journal of Clinical Investigation,957,https://openalex.org/W3011379523

Factors Associated With Death in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in the US,"<h3>Importance</h3> The US is currently an epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, yet few national data are available on patient characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of critical illness from COVID-19. <h3>Objectives</h3> To assess factors associated with death and to examine interhospital variation in treatment and outcomes for patients with COVID-19. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This multicenter cohort study assessed 2215 adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at 65 hospitals across the US from March 4 to April 4, 2020. <h3>Exposures</h3> Patient-level data, including demographics, comorbidities, and organ dysfunction, and hospital characteristics, including number of ICU beds. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The primary outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality. Multilevel logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with death and to examine interhospital variation in treatment and outcomes. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 2215 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.5 [14.5] years; 1436 [64.8%] male; 1738 [78.5%] with at least 1 chronic comorbidity) were included in the study. At 28 days after ICU admission, 784 patients (35.4%) had died, 824 (37.2%) were discharged, and 607 (27.4%) remained hospitalized. At the end of study follow-up (median, 16 days; interquartile range, 8-28 days), 875 patients (39.5%) had died, 1203 (54.3%) were discharged, and 137 (6.2%) remained hospitalized. Factors independently associated with death included older age (≥80 vs &lt;40 years of age: odds ratio [OR], 11.15; 95% CI, 6.19-20.06), male sex (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.19-1.90), higher body mass index (≥40 vs &lt;25: OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.01-2.25), coronary artery disease (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.07-2.02), active cancer (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.35-3.43), and the presence of hypoxemia (Pao<sub>2</sub>:Fio<sub>2</sub>&lt;100 vs ≥300 mm Hg: OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 2.11-4.08), liver dysfunction (liver Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 2-4 vs 0: OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.30–5.25), and kidney dysfunction (renal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 4 vs 0: OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.46–4.05) at ICU admission. Patients admitted to hospitals with fewer ICU beds had a higher risk of death (&lt;50 vs ≥100 ICU beds: OR, 3.28; 95% CI, 2.16-4.99). Hospitals varied considerably in the risk-adjusted proportion of patients who died (range, 6.6%-80.8%) and in the percentage of patients who received hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and other treatments and supportive therapies. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> This study identified demographic, clinical, and hospital-level risk factors that may be associated with death in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and can facilitate the identification of medications and supportive therapies to improve outcomes.","[""Shruti Gupta"", ""Salim S.

You Are What You Tweet: Analyzing Twitter for Public Health,"Analyzing user messages in social media can measure different population characteristics, including public health measures. For example, recent work has correlated Twitter messages with influenza rates in the United States; but this has largely been the extent of mining Twitter for public health. In this work, we consider a broader range of public health applications for Twitter. We apply the recently introduced Ailment Topic Aspect Model to over one and a half million health related tweets and discover mentions of over a dozen ailments, including allergies, obesity and insomnia. We introduce extensions to incorporate prior knowledge into this model and apply it to several tasks: tracking illnesses over times (syndromic surveillance), measuring behavioral risk factors, localizing illnesses by geographic region, and analyzing symptoms and medication usage. We show quantitative correlations with public health data and qualitative evaluations of model output. Our results suggest that Twitter has broad applicability for public health research.","[""Michael Paul"", ""Mark Dredze""]",2021-08-03,University of Melbourne,https://openalex.org/W201361503,https://doi.org/10.1609/icwsm.v5i1.14137,"[""Public health"", ""Social media"", ""Data science"", ""Computer science"", ""Topic model"", ""Population"", ""Public health surveillance"", ""Internet privacy"", ""Public relations""]",Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media,942,https://openalex.org/W201361503
"A systematic review of antibody mediated immunity to coronaviruses: kinetics, correlates of protection, and association with severity","Many public health responses and modeled scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time. The presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination (when available) will affect future transmission and illness severity. Here, we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 as well as the related SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs). We reviewed 2,452 abstracts and identified 491 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus: 1) antibody kinetics, 2) correlates of protection, 3) immunopathogenesis, 4) antigenic diversity and cross-reactivity, and 5) population seroprevalence. While further studies of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary to determine immune responses, evidence from other coronaviruses can provide clues and guide future research.","[""Angkana T.

"Global Tuberculosis Report 2020 – Reflections on the Global TB burden, treatment and prevention efforts","The October 2020 Global TB report reviews TB control strategies and United Nations (UN) targets set in the political declaration at the September 2018 UN General Assembly high-level meeting on TB held in New York. Progress in TB care and prevention has been very slow. In 2019, TB remained the most common cause of death from a single infectious pathogen. Globally, an estimated 10.0 million people developed TB disease in 2019, and there were an estimated 1.2 million TB deaths among HIV-negative people and an additional 208, 000 deaths among people living with HIV. Adults accounted for 88% and children for 12% of people with TB. The WHO regions of South-East Asia (44%), Africa (25%), and the Western Pacific (18%) had the most people with TB. Eight countries accounted for two thirds of the global total: India (26%), Indonesia (8.5%), China (8.4%), the Philippines (6.0%), Pakistan (5.7%), Nigeria (4.4%), Bangladesh (3.6%) and South Africa (3.6%). Only 30% of the 3.5 million five-year target for children treated for TB was met. Major advances have been development of new all oral regimens for MDRTB and new regimens for preventive therapy. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic dislodged TB from the top infectious disease cause of mortality globally. Notably, global TB control efforts were not on track even before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many challenges remain to improve sub-optimal TB treatment and prevention services. Tuberculosis screening and diagnostic test services need to be ramped up. The major drivers of TB remain undernutrition, poverty, diabetes, tobacco smoking, and household air pollution and these need be addressed to achieve the WHO 2035 TB care and prevention targets. National programs need to include interventions for post-tuberculosis holistic wellbeing. From first detection of COVID-19 global coordination and political will with huge financial investments have led to the development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV2 infection. The world now needs to similarly focus on development of new vaccines for TB utilizing new technological methods.","[""Jeremiah Chakaya"", ""Mishal Khan"", ""Francine Ntoumi"", ""Eleni Aklillu"", ""Razia Fatima"", ""Peter Mwaba"", ""Nathan Kapata"", ""Sayoki Mfinanga"", ""Seyed E.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign International Guidelines for the Management of Septic Shock and Sepsis-Associated Organ Dysfunction in Children,"Objectives: To develop evidence-based recommendations for clinicians caring for children (including infants, school-aged children, and adolescents) with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. Design: A panel of 49 international experts, representing 12 international organizations, as well as three methodologists and three public members was convened. Panel members assembled at key international meetings (for those panel members attending the conference), and a stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in November 2018. A formal conflict-of-interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among the chairs, co-chairs, methodologists, and group heads, as well as within subgroups, served as an integral part of the guideline development process. Methods: The panel consisted of six subgroups: recognition and management of infection, hemodynamics and resuscitation, ventilation, endocrine and metabolic therapies, adjunctive therapies, and research priorities. We conducted a systematic review for each Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes question to identify the best available evidence, statistically summarized the evidence, and then assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We used the evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or as a best practice statement. In addition, “in our practice” statements were included when evidence was inconclusive to issue a recommendation, but the panel felt that some guidance based on practice patterns may be appropriate. Results: The panel provided 77 statements on the management and resuscitation of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. Overall, six were strong recommendations, 52 were weak recommendations, and nine were best-practice statements. For 13 questions, no recommendations could be made; but, for 10 of these, “in our practice” statements were provided. In addition, 49 research priorities were identified. Conclusions: A large cohort of international experts was able to achieve consensus regarding many recommendations for the best care of children with sepsis, acknowledging that most aspects of care had relatively low quality of evidence resulting in the frequent issuance of weak recommendations. Despite this challenge, these recommendations regarding the management of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction provide a foundation for consistent care to improve outcomes and inform future research.","[""Scott L.

Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine through 6 Months,"BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine encoding a prefusion-stabilized, membrane-anchored severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) full-length spike protein. BNT162b2 is highly efficacious against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and is currently approved, conditionally approved, or authorized for emergency use worldwide. At the time of initial authorization, data beyond 2 months after vaccination were unavailable.In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, multinational, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned 44,165 participants 16 years of age or older and 2264 participants 12 to 15 years of age to receive two 30-μg doses, at 21 days apart, of BNT162b2 or placebo. The trial end points were vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety, which were both evaluated through 6 months after vaccination.BNT162b2 continued to be safe and have an acceptable adverse-event profile. Few participants had adverse events leading to withdrawal from the trial. Vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 was 91.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.0 to 93.2) through 6 months of follow-up among the participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection who could be evaluated. There was a gradual decline in vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy of 86 to 100% was seen across countries and in populations with diverse ages, sexes, race or ethnic groups, and risk factors for Covid-19 among participants without evidence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine efficacy against severe disease was 96.7% (95% CI, 80.3 to 99.9). In South Africa, where the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern B.1.351 (or beta) was predominant, a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI, 53.5 to 100) was observed.Through 6 months of follow-up and despite a gradual decline in vaccine efficacy, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety profile and was highly efficacious in preventing Covid-19.

Association between mobility patterns and COVID-19 transmission in the USA: a mathematical modelling study,"Within 4 months of COVID-19 first being reported in the USA, it spread to every state and to more than 90% of all counties. During this period, the US COVID-19 response was highly decentralised, with stay-at-home directives issued by state and local officials, subject to varying levels of enforcement. The absence of a centralised policy and timeline combined with the complex dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission in the USA a challenge.We used daily mobility data derived from aggregated and anonymised cell (mobile) phone data, provided by Teralytics (Zürich, Switzerland) from Jan 1 to April 20, 2020, to capture real-time trends in movement patterns for each US county, and used these data to generate a social distancing metric. We used epidemiological data to compute the COVID-19 growth rate ratio for a given county on a given day. Using these metrics, we evaluated how social distancing, measured by the relative change in mobility, affected the rate of new infections in the 25 counties in the USA with the highest number of confirmed cases on April 16, 2020, by fitting a statistical model for each county.Our analysis revealed that mobility patterns are strongly correlated with decreased COVID-19 case growth rates for the most affected counties in the USA, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 0·7 for 20 of the 25 counties evaluated. Additionally, the effect of changes in mobility patterns, which dropped by 35-63% relative to the normal conditions, on COVID-19 transmission are not likely to be perceptible for 9-12 days, and potentially up to 3 weeks, which is consistent with the incubation time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 plus additional time for reporting. We also show evidence that behavioural changes were already underway in many US counties days to weeks before state-level or local-level stay-at-home policies were implemented, implying that individuals anticipated public health directives where social distancing was adopted, despite a mixed political message.This study strongly supports a role of social distancing as an effective way to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the USA. Until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, social distancing will remain one of the primary measures to combat disease spread, and these findings should serve to support more timely policy making around social distancing in the USA in the future.None.","[""Hamada S.

"Global, regional, and national burden of disorders affecting the nervous system, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021","Background: Disorders affecting the nervous system are diverse and include neurodevelopmental disorders, late-life neurodegeneration, and newly emergent conditions, such as cognitive impairment following COVID-19. Previous publications from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor Study estimated the burden of 15 neurological conditions in 2015 and 2016, but these analyses did not include neurodevelopmental disorders, as defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11, or a subset of cases of congenital, neonatal, and infectious conditions that cause neurological damage. Here, we estimate nervous system health loss caused by 37 unique conditions and their associated risk factors globally, regionally, and nationally from 1990 to 2021. Methods: We estimated mortality, prevalence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs), by age and sex in 204 countries and territories, from 1990 to 2021. We included morbidity and deaths due to neurological conditions, for which health loss is directly due to damage to the CNS or peripheral nervous system. We also isolated neurological health loss from conditions for which nervous system morbidity is a consequence, but not the primary feature, including a subset of congenital conditions (ie, chromosomal anomalies and congenital birth defects), neonatal conditions (ie, jaundice, preterm birth, and sepsis), infectious diseases (ie, COVID-19, cystic echinococcosis, malaria, syphilis, and Zika virus disease), and diabetic neuropathy. By conducting a sequela-level analysis of the health outcomes for these conditions, only cases where nervous system damage occurred were included, and YLDs were recalculated to isolate the non-fatal burden directly attributable to nervous system health loss. A comorbidity correction was used to calculate total prevalence of all conditions that affect the nervous system combined. Findings: Globally, the 37 conditions affecting the nervous system were collectively ranked as the leading group cause of DALYs in 2021 (443 million, 95% UI 378–521), affecting 3·40 billion (3·20–3·62) individuals (43·1%, 40·5–45·9 of the global population); global DALY counts attributed to these conditions increased by 18·2% (8·7–26·7) between 1990 and 2021. Age-standardised rates of deaths per 100 000 people attributed to these conditions decreased from 1990 to 2021 by 33·6% (27·6–38·8), and age-standardised rates of DALYs attributed to these conditions decreased by 27·0% (21·5–32·4). Age-standardised prevalence was almost stable, with a change of 1·5% (0·7–2·4). The ten conditions with the highest age-standardised DALYs in 2021 were stroke, neonatal encephalopathy, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, diabetic neuropathy, meningitis, epilepsy, neurological complications due to preterm birth, autism spectrum disorder, and nervous system cancer. Interpretation: As the leading cause of overall disease burden in the world, with increasing global DALY counts, effective prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies for disorders affecting the nervous system are needed.

The Medical Segmentation Decathlon,"International challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative assessment of image analysis algorithms given a specific task. Segmentation is so far the most widely investigated medical image processing task, but the various segmentation challenges have typically been organized in isolation, such that algorithm development was driven by the need to tackle a single specific clinical problem. We hypothesized that a method capable of performing well on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and potentially outperform a custom-designed solution. To investigate the hypothesis, we organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) - a biomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude of both tasks and modalities. The underlying data set was designed to explore the axis of difficulties typically encountered when dealing with medical images, such as small data sets, unbalanced labels, multi-site data and small objects. The MSD challenge confirmed that algorithms with a consistent good performance on a set of tasks preserved their good average performance on a different set of previously unseen tasks. Moreover, by monitoring the MSD winner for two years, we found that this algorithm continued generalizing well to a wide range of other clinical problems, further confirming our hypothesis. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms are mature, accurate, and generalize well when retrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across multiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the training of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to non AI experts.","[""Michela Antonelli"", ""Annika Reinke"", ""Spyridon Bakas"", ""Keyvan Farahani"", ""Annette Kopp\u2010Schneider"", ""Bennett A.

Deployment of convalescent plasma for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spurred a global health crisis. To date, there are no proven options for prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS–CoV-2, nor therapy for those who develop COVID-19. Immune (i.e., ""convalescent"") plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals following resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy for conferring immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. There are numerous examples in which convalescent plasma has been used successfully as postexposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]). Convalescent plasma has also been used in the COVID-19 pandemic; limited data from China suggest clinical benefit, including radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads, and improved survival. Globally, blood centers have robust infrastructure for undertaking collections and constructing inventories of convalescent plasma to meet the growing demand. Nonetheless, there are nuanced challenges, both regulatory and logistical, spanning donor eligibility, donor recruitment, collections, and transfusion itself. Data from rigorously controlled clinical trials of convalescent plasma are also few, underscoring the need to evaluate its use objectively for a range of indications (e.g., prevention vs. treatment) and patient populations (e.g., age, comorbid disease). We provide an overview of convalescent plasma, including evidence of benefit, regulatory considerations, logistical work flow, and proposed clinical trials, as scale-up is brought underway to mobilize this critical resource.","[""Evan M.

Advanced Electrocatalysts with Single-Metal-Atom Active Sites,"Electrocatalysts with single metal atoms as active sites have received increasing attention owing to their high atomic utilization efficiency and exotic catalytic activity and selectivity. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary on the recent development of such single-atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) for various energy-conversion reactions. The discussion starts with an introduction of the different types of SAECs, followed by an overview of the synthetic methodologies to control the atomic dispersion of metal sites and atomically resolved characterization using state-of-the-art microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. In recognition of the extensive applications of SAECs, the electrocatalytic studies are dissected in terms of various important electrochemical reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Examples of SAECs are deliberated in each case in terms of their catalytic performance, structure-property relationships, and catalytic enhancement mechanisms. A perspective is provided at the end of each section about remaining challenges and opportunities for the development of SAECs for the targeted reaction.","[""Yuxuan Wang"", ""Hongyang Su"", ""Yanghua He"", ""Ligui Li"", ""Shangqian Zhu"", ""H.

DetectoRS: Detecting Objects with Recursive Feature Pyramid and Switchable Atrous Convolution,"Many modern object detectors demonstrate outstanding performances by using the mechanism of looking and thinking twice. In this paper, we explore this mechanism in the backbone design for object detection. At the macro level, we propose Recursive Feature Pyramid, which incorporates extra feedback connections from Feature Pyramid Networks into the bottom-up backbone layers. At the micro level, we propose Switchable Atrous Convolution, which convolves the features with different atrous rates and gathers the results using switch functions. Combining them results in DetectoRS, which significantly improves the performances of object detection. On COCO test-dev, DetectoRS achieves state-of-the-art 55.7% box AP for object detection, 48.5% mask AP for instance segmentation, and 50.0% PQ for panoptic segmentation.

Prevention and Management of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Survivors of Adult Cancers: ASCO Guideline Update,"To update the ASCO guideline on the recommended prevention and treatment approaches in the management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in adult cancer survivors.An Expert Panel conducted targeted systematic literature reviews to identify new studies.The search strategy identified 257 new references, which led to a full-text review of 87 manuscripts. A total of 3 systematic reviews, 2 with meta-analyses, and 28 primary trials for prevention of CIPN in addition to 14 primary trials related to treatment of established CIPN, are included in this update.The identified data reconfirmed that no agents are recommended for the prevention of CIPN. The use of acetyl-l-carnitine for the prevention of CIPN in patients with cancer should be discouraged. Furthermore, clinicians should assess the appropriateness of dose delaying, dose reduction, substitutions, or stopping chemotherapy in patients who develop intolerable neuropathy and/or functional impairment. Duloxetine is the only agent that has appropriate evidence to support its use for patients with established painful CIPN. Nonetheless, the amount of benefit from duloxetine is limited.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/survivorship-guidelines.","[""Charles L.

Intestinal microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids regulation of immune cell IL-22 production and gut immunity,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and CD4+ T cells produce IL-22, which is critical for intestinal immunity. The microbiota is central to IL-22 production in the intestines; however, the factors that regulate IL-22 production by CD4+ T cells and ILCs are not clear. Here, we show that microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) promote IL-22 production by CD4+ T cells and ILCs through G-protein receptor 41 (GPR41) and inhibiting histone deacetylase (HDAC). SCFAs upregulate IL-22 production by promoting aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) expression, which are differentially regulated by mTOR and Stat3. HIF1α binds directly to the Il22 promoter, and SCFAs increase HIF1α binding to the Il22 promoter through histone modification. SCFA supplementation enhances IL-22 production, which protects intestines from inflammation. SCFAs promote human CD4+ T cell IL-22 production. These findings establish the roles of SCFAs in inducing IL-22 production in CD4+ T cells and ILCs to maintain intestinal homeostasis.","[""Wenjing Yang"", ""Tianming Yu"", ""Xiangsheng Huang"", ""Anthony J.

Patterns of somatic structural variation in human cancer genomes,"A key mutational process in cancer is structural variation, in which rearrangements delete, amplify or reorder genomic segments that range in size from kilobases to whole chromosomes1-7. Here we develop methods to group, classify and describe somatic structural variants, using data from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which aggregated whole-genome sequencing data from 2,658 cancers across 38 tumour types8. Sixteen signatures of structural variation emerged. Deletions have a multimodal size distribution, assort unevenly across tumour types and patients, are enriched in late-replicating regions and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have a multimodal size distribution, but are enriched in early-replicating regions-as are unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy-number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 2-7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, and-in liver cancer-frequently activate the telomerase gene TERT. A wide variety of rearrangement processes are active in cancer, which generate complex configurations of the genome upon which selection can act.","[""Yilong Li"", ""Nicola D.

"A Review of Deep Learning in Medical Imaging: Imaging Traits, Technology Trends, Case Studies With Progress Highlights, and Future Promises","Since its renaissance, deep learning has been widely used in various medical imaging tasks and has achieved remarkable success in many medical imaging applications, thereby propelling us into the so-called artificial intelligence (AI) era. It is known that the success of AI is mostly attributed to the availability of big data with annotations for a single task and the advances in high performance computing. However, medical imaging presents unique challenges that confront deep learning approaches. In this survey paper, we first present traits of medical imaging, highlight both clinical needs and technical challenges in medical imaging, and describe how emerging trends in deep learning are addressing these issues. We cover the topics of network architecture, sparse and noisy labels, federating learning, interpretability, uncertainty quantification, etc. Then, we present several case studies that are commonly found in clinical practice, including digital pathology and chest, brain, cardiovascular, and abdominal imaging. Rather than presenting an exhaustive literature survey, we instead describe some prominent research highlights related to these case study applications. We conclude with a discussion and presentation of promising future directions.","[""S. Kevin Zhou"", ""Hayit Greenspan"", ""Christos Davatzikos"", ""James S.

Characteristics and Outcomes of US Children and Adolescents With Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Compared With Severe Acute COVID-19,"<h3>Importance</h3> Refinement of criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) may inform efforts to improve health outcomes. <h3>Objective</h3> To compare clinical characteristics and outcomes of children and adolescents with MIS-C vs those with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). <h3>Setting, Design, and Participants</h3> Case series of 1116 patients aged younger than 21 years hospitalized between March 15 and October 31, 2020, at 66 US hospitals in 31 states. Final date of follow-up was January 5, 2021. Patients with MIS-C had fever, inflammation, multisystem involvement, and positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antibody test results or recent exposure with no alternate diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 had positive RT-PCR test results and severe organ system involvement. <h3>Exposure</h3> SARS-CoV-2. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Presenting symptoms, organ system complications, laboratory biomarkers, interventions, and clinical outcomes. Multivariable regression was used to compute adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) of factors associated with MIS-C vs COVID-19. <h3>Results</h3> Of 1116 patients (median age, 9.7 years; 45% female), 539 (48%) were diagnosed with MIS-C and 577 (52%) with COVID-19. Compared with patients with COVID-19, patients with MIS-C were more likely to be 6 to 12 years old (40.8% vs 19.4%; absolute risk difference [RD], 21.4% [95% CI, 16.1%-26.7%]; aRR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.33-1.72] vs 0-5 years) and non-Hispanic Black (32.3% vs 21.5%; RD, 10.8% [95% CI, 5.6%-16.0%]; aRR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.17-1.76] vs White). Compared with patients with COVID-19, patients with MIS-C were more likely to have cardiorespiratory involvement (56.0% vs 8.8%; RD, 47.2% [95% CI, 42.4%-52.0%]; aRR, 2.99 [95% CI, 2.55-3.50] vs respiratory involvement), cardiovascular without respiratory involvement (10.6% vs 2.9%; RD, 7.7% [95% CI, 4.7%-10.6%]; aRR, 2.49 [95% CI, 2.05-3.02] vs respiratory involvement), and mucocutaneous without cardiorespiratory involvement (7.1% vs 2.3%; RD, 4.8% [95% CI, 2.3%-7.3%]; aRR, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.84-2.85] vs respiratory involvement). Patients with MIS-C had higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (median, 6.4 vs 2.7,<i>P</i> &lt; .001), higher C-reactive protein level (median, 152 mg/L vs 33 mg/L;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and lower platelet count (&lt;150 ×10<sup>3</sup>cells/μL [212/523 {41%} vs 84/486 {17%},<i>P</i> &lt; .001]). A total of 398 patients (73.8%) with MIS-C and 253 (43.8%) with COVID-19 were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 10 (1.9%) with MIS-C and 8 (1.4%) with COVID-19 died during hospitalization. Among patients with MIS-C with reduced left ventricular systolic function (172/503, 34.2%) and coronary artery aneurysm (57/424, 13.4%), an estimated 91.0% (95% CI, 86.0%-94.7%) and 79.1% (95% CI, 67.1%-89.1%), respectively, normalized within 30 days. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> This case series of patients with MIS-C and with COVID-19 identified patterns of clinical presentation and organ system involvement. These patterns may help differentiate between MIS-C and COVID-19.","[""Leora R. Feldstein"", ""Mark W. Tenforde"", ""Kevin G. Friedman"", ""Margaret M.

Relatlimab and Nivolumab versus Nivolumab in Untreated Advanced Melanoma,"Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) and programmed death 1 (PD-1) are distinct inhibitory immune checkpoints that contribute to T-cell exhaustion. The combination of relatlimab, a LAG-3-blocking antibody, and nivolumab, a PD-1-blocking antibody, has been shown to be safe and to have antitumor activity in patients with previously treated melanoma, but the safety and activity in patients with previously untreated melanoma need investigation.In this phase 2-3, global, double-blind, randomized trial, we evaluated relatlimab and nivolumab as a fixed-dose combination as compared with nivolumab alone when administered intravenously every 4 weeks to patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable melanoma. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by blinded independent central review.The median progression-free survival was 10.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.4 to 15.7) with relatlimab-nivolumab as compared with 4.6 months (95% CI, 3.4 to 5.6) with nivolumab (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.92]; P = 0.006 by the log-rank test). Progression-free survival at 12 months was 47.7% (95% CI, 41.8 to 53.2) with relatlimab-nivolumab as compared with 36.0% (95% CI, 30.5 to 41.6) with nivolumab. Progression-free survival across key subgroups favored relatlimab-nivolumab over nivolumab. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 18.9% of patients in the relatlimab-nivolumab group and in 9.7% of patients in the nivolumab group.The inhibition of two immune checkpoints, LAG-3 and PD-1, provided a greater benefit with regard to progression-free survival than inhibition of PD-1 alone in patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable melanoma. Relatlimab and nivolumab in combination showed no new safety signals. (Funded by Bristol Myers Squibb; RELATIVITY-047 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03470922.).","[""Hussein A.

American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminology: 2021 Version,"INTRODUCTION In the early 2000s, a subcommittee of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) set out to “standardize terminology of periodic and rhythmic EEG patterns in the critically ill to aid in future research involving such patterns.” The initial proposed terminology was published in 2005.1 This was presented at many meetings on several continents, subjected to multiple rounds of testing of interrater reliability, underwent many revisions, and was then published as an ACNS guideline in 2013.2 Interrater agreement of the 2012 version (published in early 2013) was very good, with almost perfect agreement for seizures, main terms 1 and 2, the +S modifier, sharpness, absolute amplitude, frequency, and number of phases.3 Agreement was substantial for the +F and +R modifiers (66% and 67%) but was only moderate for triphasic morphology (58%) and fair for evolution (21%, likely at least partly because of the short EEG samples provided).3 The authors concluded that interrater agreement for most terms in the ACNS critical care EEG terminology was high and that these terms were suitable for multicenter research on the clinical significance of these critical care EEG patterns. With the help of infrastructure funding from the American Epilepsy Society and administrative and website support from the ACNS, a database that incorporated the ACNS terminology was developed for clinical and research purposes, tested during routine clinical care in multiple centers,4 and made available at no cost on the ACNS website (https://www.acns.org/research/critical-care-eeg-monitoring-research-consortium-ccemrc/ccemrc-public-database). This greatly enhanced the ability to complete multicenter investigations. After the establishment of the standardized terminology and free access to a database incorporating these terms, there have been many investigations into the clinical significance of rhythmic and periodic patterns (RPPs) in critically ill patients. Patterns such as lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA) were found to be highly associated with acute seizures,5,6 equivalent to the association found with lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs) in one study.5 The association of all the main patterns in the nomenclature with seizures was defined in a multicenter cohort of almost 5,000 patients, with seizure rates highest for LPDs, intermediate for LRDA and generalized periodic discharges (GPDs), and lowest for generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA).6 This and other studies have shown that several of the modifiers within the nomenclature do indeed have clinically relevant meaning. For example, studies have shown that higher frequency (especially >1.5 Hz), higher prevalence, longer duration, and having a “plus” modifier are all associated with a higher chance of acute seizures.6,7 On the other hand, whether a pattern was spontaneous or “stimulus-induced” did not seem to have a significant effect on its association with seizures.6 In other investigations, the “triphasic morphology” modifier was investigated blindly with multiple expert reviewers, calling into question its relationship with metabolic encephalopathy and its lack of a relationship with seizures.8,9 For patients with refractory status epilepticus treated with anesthetic-induced coma, the presence of “highly epileptiform” bursts suggested that an attempted wean off of anesthetics at that time was much more likely to lead to seizure recurrence than if the bursts were not highly epileptiform.10 Even long-term outcome seemed to be associated with some modifiers, with a higher risk of later epilepsy found if LPDs were more prevalent, had longer duration, or had a “plus” modifier.7 CHANGES IN THE 2021 VERSION OF THE TERMINOLOGY Although the previous version of the terminology was easy to use, reliable, and valuable for both research and clinical care, new terms and concepts have emerged. In this version, we incorporate recent research findings, add definitions of several new terms, and clarify a few definitions of old terms. Most of the old terms remain unchanged, but there have been some important clarifications and corrections (such as the calculation of the number of phases) and multiple additions. All changes have been summarized in Table 1. One new main term 1 was added (Unilateral Independent), and main term 2 “Lateralized” was updated to include “bilateral asynchronous” patterns. Electrographic seizures (ESz), electrographic status epilepticus (ESE), electroclinical seizures (ECSz), and electroclinical status epilepticus (ECSE) have now been defined, largely based on the “Salzburg criteria.”11,12 Brief potentially ictal rhythmic discharges (BIRDs) have been added based on recent publications13,14, and a consensus definition of the ictal-interictal continuum (IIC) has been proposed. We also added definitions of identical bursts,15 state changes, cyclic alternating pattern of encephalopathy (CAPE), and extreme delta brush (EDB).16 To facilitate daily use, we are also providing the “ACNS Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminology 2021: Condensed Version” (see Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/JCNP/A149) and the “ACNS Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminology 2021: Reference Chart” (see Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/JCNP/A150). Finally, for educational purposes and conceptual clarity, we provided extensive schematic diagrams (Figures 1–42) of most patterns to quickly demonstrate the core features and principles. Supplemental figures include EEG examples from 30 cases and are available as Supplemental Digital Content at http://links.lww.com/JCNP/A134. TABLE 1. - ACNS Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminology: Major and Minor Changes Between the 2012 and 2021 Versions Major changes EEG background • “Variability” and “Stage II sleep transients (K-complexes and spindles)” now combined under “State changes”. • Cyclic Alternating Pattern of Encephalopathy (CAPE) (new term: Section A7, page 7) • Identical bursts (new term: Section A4d, page 6) Rhythmic and Periodic Patterns (RPPs: PDs, RDA and SW) • Unilateral Independent (UI) (new Main Term 1 option: Section C1d, page 10) • Lateralized (bilateral asynchronous) (Main Term 1: Section C1b, page 9) • Patterns that consistently begin in one hemisphere and propagate to the other hemisphere can now be included as a lateralized (bilateral asynchronous) pattern. • Frequency • For PDs and SW, typical frequencies >2.5 Hz can only be applied to RPPs <10 s duration (“very brief” by definition); if PDs or SW have a typical frequency >2.5 Hz and are ≥10 s these would qualify as electrographic seizures (criterion A) and should be referred to as such rather than as PDs or SW. • No RPP in this terminology can have a typical frequency of >4 Hz; if a pattern is > 4 Hz and ≥0.5 s, it would always meet criteria for either BIRDs (if <10 s) or an electrographic seizure (if ≥10 s) (see definitions below). If <0.5 s, this would not qualify as any RPP, but might qualify as a polyspike. • Evolution • Evolution of an RPP is now limited to patterns that are ≤4 Hz AND <10 s duration. Any >4-Hz RPP with evolution lasting <10 s would qualify as a definite BIRD (see Section E, page 24). Any RPP with evolution lasting ≥10 s meets criterion B of an electrographic seizure and should be coded as such. • Extreme Delta Brush (EDB) (new term: Section C3i, page 19) • Stimulus-Terminated (new modifier) Electrographic and Electroclinical Seizure Activity • Electrographic seizure (ESz) (new term: Section D1, page 22) • Electrographic status epilepticus (ESE) (new term: Section D2, page 23) • Electroclinical seizure (ECSz) (new term: Section D3, page 24) • Electroclinical status epilepticus (ECSE) (new term: Section D4, page 24) • Possible electroclinical status epilepticus (new term: Section D4b, page 24) Brief Potentially Ictal Rhythmic Discharges (BIRDs) (new term: Section E, page 24) Ictal-Interictal Continuum (IIC) (new term: Section F, page 25) Minor changes EEG background • Predominant background frequency • Beta (>13 Hz) has now been added (rather than only “alpha or faster”) • Continuity • Nearly continuous changed from ≤10% to 1–9% attenuation/suppression • Burst suppression changed from >50% attenuation/suppression to 50–99% • Suppression/attenuation changed from entirety to >99% of the record • Burst attenuation/suppression • Can now also be described by applying the location descriptions of Main term 1 • Highly Epileptiform Bursts • Previously: present if multiple epileptiform discharges are seen within the majority (>50%) of bursts and occur at an average of 1/s or faster OR if a rhythmic, potentially ictal-appearing pattern occurs at 1/s or faster within the majority (>50%) of bursts. • Updated to: present if 2 or more epileptiform discharges (spikes or sharp waves) are seen within the majority (>50%) of bursts and occur at an average of 1 Hz or faster within a single burst (frequency is calculated as the inverse of the typical interpeak latency of consecutive epileptiform discharges within a single burst) OR if a rhythmic, potentially ictal-appearing pattern occurs at 1/s or faster within the majority (>50%) of bursts. • Voltage • High (most or all activity ≥150 µV) has now been added as a category Rhythmic and periodic patterns • Duration: • Intermediate duration changed from 1–4.9 mins to 1–9.9 mins (to match the definition of focal status epilepticus with impaired consciousness by the International League Against Epilepsy).17 • Long duration accordingly changed from 5–59 mins to 10–59 mins • Absolute voltage (amplitude) • Medium, changed from 50–199 µV to 50–149 µV • High accordingly changed from ≥200 µV to ≥150 µV • Polarity changed from major modifier to minor modifier METHODS All the definitions are based on extensive discussions not only among the authors of this document but also among many others, both live and via email and questionnaires. There was not always complete consensus on some issues; electronic voting (with each voter blinded to the opinion of others for the first round) was used for most of these issues. We considered additional changes from previous versions or from the literature such as eliminating the 10-second cutoff for defining electrographic seizures but because no clear consensus was reached (it was close to a split decision), this was not changed. 2021 ACNS CRITICAL CARE EEG TERMINOLOGY CONTENTS A.

ELECTROGRAPHIC AND ELECTROCLINICAL SEIZURES [NEW, 2021] E.BRIEF POTENTIALLY ICTAL RHYTHMIC DISCHARGES (BIRDs) [NEW, 2021] F. ICTAL-INTERICTAL CONTINUUM (IIC) [NEW, 2021] G. MINIMUM REPORTING REQUIREMENTS H. OTHER TERMS General Notes NOTE: This terminology is intended to be used at all ages, excluding neonates, although some terms may not be ideal for infants. For the neonatal version of the terminology, please see https://www.acns.org/UserFiles/file/The_American_Clinical_Neurophysiology_Society_s.12.pdf.18 NOTE: This terminology is intended for use in the critically ill, although it can be applied in other settings as well. It is mostly compatible with the 2017 multinational revised glossary of terms most commonly used by clinical electroencephalographers.19 NOTE: Although any finding on EEG can be focal, regional, or hemispheric, such as an asymmetry or slowing, and this is a very important distinction in some circumstances such as epilepsy surgery, all of these are combined within the terms “lateralized” or “asymmetric” in this nomenclature. However, additional localizing information (e.g., where the pattern is maximal and which lobes are involved) can be provided and can also be applied to several modifiers and sporadic epileptiform discharges. This additional localizing information was built into the freely available Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium (CCEMRC) database that incorporated the previous version of this nomenclature (https://www.acns.org/research/critical-care-eeg-monitoring-research-consortium-ccemrc/ccemrc-public-database).4 A new database is being created with this 2021 nomenclature fully incorporated. NOTE: In this section and throughout the document, the term “ictal” is used to refer to an EEG pattern seen during an epileptic seizure, whether clinical or electrographic-only, as the term is commonly used in EEG literature. NOTE: “Hz” is used as an abbreviation for “per second” for all types of periodic or rhythmic patterns, even when referring to noncontinuous waveforms. NOTE: All voltage measurements in this document are based on peak to trough (not peak to baseline) measurements in a standard 10–20 longitudinal bipolar recording. However, for assessing voltage symmetry, an appropriate referential recording is preferred. NOTE: The term “consistent” or “consistently” refers to >80% of instances (e.g., >80% of discharges in a periodic pattern, >80% of cycles of a rhythmic pattern, or present >80% of the record for a background pattern). A. EEG BACKGROUND 1. Symmetry a. Symmetric. b. Mild asymmetry (consistent asymmetry in voltage [Fig. 1A] on an appropriate referential recording of <50% or consistent asymmetry in frequency of 0.5 to 1 Hz [Fig. 1B]). c. Marked asymmetry (≥50% voltage or >1 Hz frequency asymmetry [Fig. 1C]). FIG. 1.: A. Symmetric vs mild asymmetry in voltage. B. Symmetric vs mild asymmetry in frequency. C. Marked asymmetry in voltage and frequency.NOTE: When any of the following features (Section A2–A10) are asymmetric, they should be described separately for each hemisphere. 2. Predominant Background Frequency When Most Awake or After Stimulation a. Beta (>13 Hz) b. Alpha. c. Theta. d. Delta. NOTE: If two or three frequency bands are equally prominent, report each one. 3. Posterior Dominant (“Alpha”) Rhythm (must be demonstrated to attenuate with eye opening; wait >1 second after eye closure to determine frequency to avoid “alpha squeak”) a. Present: Specify frequency to the nearest 0.5 Hz. b. Absent. c. Unclear. 4. Continuity (Fig. 2) a. Continuous b. Nearly Continuous: continuous, but with occasional (1–9% of the record) periods of attenuation or suppression lasting ≥1 second. Describe typical duration of attenuation/suppression. i. Attenuation: periods of lower voltage are ≥10 µV but <50% of the higher voltage background. ii. Suppression: periods of lower voltage are <10 µV. FIG. 2.: Continuity. Percentages for each category refer to the percentage of the record that is “attenuated” or “suppressed.” How this percentage is derived is demonstrated in Fig. 4, page 6.NOTE: If attenuations/suppressions are stimulus-induced, this is referred to as “SI-attenuation” or “SI-suppression.” NOTE: This voltage cutoff, as with other voltages, differs from the ACNS neonatal terminology.18 c. Discontinuous: A pattern of attenuation/suppression alternating with higher voltage activity, with 10% to 49% of the record consisting of attenuation or suppression. d. Burst attenuation/Burst suppression: A pattern of attenuation/suppression alternating with higher voltage activity, with 50% to 99% of the record consisting of attenuation (see Supp EEG 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JCNP/A134) or suppression (see Supp EEG 2, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JCNP/A134). NOTE: The term “suppression-burst” is synonymous with “burst-suppression.” NOTE: Bursts must average ≥0.5 seconds and have at least 4 phases (i.e., at least 3 baseline crossings; see Section C 3d, page 13, for definition of number of phases); if shorter or fewer phases, they should be considered “discharges” (as defined under RPPs, main term 2, see Section C 2a, page 12) (Fig. 3). Bursts within burst-suppression or burst-attenuation can last up to 30 seconds.FIG. 3.: Discharge vs. Burst. *Phase: an area under the curve on one side of the baseline (see Section C 3d, page 13, and Fig. 23, page 13).For nearly continuous, discontinuous, and burst attenuation/burst suppression patterns, specify: i. Attenuation Percent or Suppression Percent: the percent of the record/epoch that is attenuated or suppressed (Fig. 4). This can range from 1% to 99%. If <1%, it is considered continuous. If >99%, it is considered either suppressed or attenuated, but not burst-attenuation/burst-suppression or discontinuous. For example, a record with 2 second bursts alternating with 8 seconds of suppression would be burst-suppression with a suppression percent of 80%. FIG. 4.: Attenuation percent or Suppression percent: the percent of the record/epoch that is attenuated or suppressed. This can range from 1% to 99%. If <1%, it is considered continuous. If >99%, it is considered either suppressed or attenuated, but not discontinuous. For example, a record with 2 second bursts alternating with 8 seconds of suppression, as shown here, would be Burst-Suppression with a suppression percent of 80%.For burst attenuation/burst suppression patterns only, also specify the following: i. Localization of bursts: Bursts can be described using the same terms in Main Term 1 that apply to rhythmic and periodic discharges: generalized (including with shifting predominance; see Section C 1a below, page 9), lateralized, bilateral independent, unilateral independent, or multifocal (Fig. 5). ii. Typical duration of bursts and interburst intervals. iii. Sharpest component of a typical burst using the sharpness categories defined under Section C 3e below, page 14. iv. The presence or absence of “Highly Epileptiform Bursts”: present if two or more epileptiform discharges (spikes or sharp waves) are seen within most (>50%) bursts and occur at an average of 1 Hz or faster within a single burst (frequency is calculated as the inverse of the typical interpeak latency of consecutive epileptiform discharges within a single burst) (see Supp EEG 3, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JCNP/A134) (Fig. 6A); record typical frequency and location (G, L, BI, UI or Mf, as defined in RPP Section C1, page 9). Also present if a rhythmic, potentially ictal-appearing pattern occurs within most (>50%) bursts; record maximum frequency and location if this occurs (Fig. 6B). v. The presence or absence of “Identical Bursts”: Present if the first 0.5 seconds or longer of each burst (Fig. 7A) or of each stereotyped cluster of 2 or more bursts (Fig. 7B) appears visually similar in all channels in most (>90%) bursts (see Supp EEG 4, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JCNP/A134). e. Suppression/attenuation: entirety or near-entirety (>99%) of the record consists of either suppression (all <10 µV, as defined above) or low voltage activity (all <20 µV but not qualifying as suppression). Specify whether attenuated or suppressed. FIG. 5.: Localization of bursts. A. Generalized bursts, shifting predominance based on asynchrony. Symmetric bursts, at times starting on the left and others on the right, but never consistently the same side. This would be an example of generalized bursts, with shifting predominance based on asynchrony (rather than asymmetry, where they would sometimes be of greater amplitude on the left and other times the right). B. Lateralized bursts, bilateral asynchronous. Symmetric bursts consistently starting on the left with a lag before being seen on the right. This is an example of lateralized, bilateral asynchronous bursts. They are not Bilateral Independent (BI) bursts because there is a consistent relationship between the activity between hemispheres, i.e. the patterns are not independent.FIG. 6.: A. Highly Epileptiform Bursts. ‐‐‐ dashed lines represent longer duration of suppression; ED epileptiform discharge. B. Highly Epileptiform Bursts. ‐‐‐ dashed lines represent longer duration of suppression.FIG. 7.: A. Identical Bursts. The first 0.5 seconds or longer of each burst are visually similar in all channels (though only 1 channel shown) in most (>90%) bursts. B. Identical Bursts in a Stereotyped Cluster. The first 0.5 seconds or longer of each of 2 or more bursts in a stereotyped cluster are visually similar in all channels (though only 1 channel shown) in most (>90%) bursts.5. Reactivity Change in cerebral EEG activity to stimulation: This may include change in voltage or frequency, including attenuation of activity. Strength and/or nature of stimulus should be noted, and a standard protocol of testing reactivity with multiple escalating stimuli is strongly encouraged.20,21 Appearance of muscle activity or eye blink artifacts does not qualify as reactive. Categorize as the following: a. Reactive. b. Unreactive. NOTE: It is suggested that if an EEG is “unreactive” after one round of stimulation, a second round of standardized noxious stimulation should be performed to confirm the finding and should be applied with the patient in their nonstimulated state. If “unreactive” and the patient is on sedatives or paralytics, we suggest including this important caveat in the impression. c. SIRPIDs-only: when the only reactivity is stimulus-induced rhythmic, periodic, or ictal-appearing discharges (SIRPIDs).22 This includes SI-RDA, SI-PDs, SI-SW, SI-seizures, SI-bursts, SI-IIC, or SI-BIRDs (see multiple sections below). d. Unclear (typically used when testing may have not been adequate, there was too much artifact to assess the response, or there was a hint of a change in cerebral activity but not definite). e. Unknown (typically used when reactivity was not tested or patient was maximally alert throughout the EEG epoch). 6. State Changes Present if there are at least 2 sustained types of background EEG related to the level of alertness or stimulation; each must persist at least 60 seconds to qualify as a “state” (Fig. 8). Stimulation should be able to transition the patient from the less alert to more alert/more stimulated state. State changes can also occur spontaneously. The more alert/stimulated pattern is considered the primary reported “background” EEG pattern for the patient. Categorize state changes as the following: a. Present with normal stage N2 sleep transients (K-complexes and spindles) b. Present but with abnormal stage N2 sleep transients • Describe both K complexes and spindles separately as the following: i. Present and normal. ii. Present but abnormal. Specify abnormality (e.g., asymmetry, location, frequency, poorly formed). iii. Absent. c. Present but without stage N2 sleep transients. d. Absent FIG. 8.: State changes. At least 2 sustained types of background EEG, where: 1. The background activity is related to level of alertness or stimulation. 2. Each must persist ≥60 seconds to qualify as a “state“. 3. Stimulation should be able to transition the patient from the less alert to more alert/more stimulated state. 4. The more alert/more stimulated state is considered the “reported background” EEG. 5. State changes can also occur spontaneously. STIM = stimulation, Spont. = spontaneous.NOTE: The presence of state changes virtually always indicates the presence of reactivity; however, the presence of reactivity does not necessarily indicate the presence of state changes because the reactivity may last <60 seconds. 7. Cyclic Alternating Pattern of Encephalopathy (CAPE) CAPE refers to changes in background patterns (which may include RPPs), each lasting at least 10 seconds, and spontaneously alternating between the 2 patterns in a regular manner for at least six cycles (but often lasts minutes to hours) (Fig. 9). A cycle refers to the period of time before the sequence repeats (i.e., includes both states once). Document whether seen in the patient's more awake/stimulated state or less awake state if known. Describe each pattern and typical duration of each pattern. Optional: Describe if this pattern corresponds with cycling of other functions such as respirations, heart rate, blood pressure, movements, muscle artifact, and pupil size. a. Present. b. Absent. c. Unknown/unclear. FIG. 9.: Cyclic Alternating Pattern of Encephalopathy (CAPE). Changes in EEG background between pattern 1 and pattern 2, where: 1. Each pattern lasts at least 10 seconds, 2. Spontaneously alternates between the two patterns in a regular manner, 3. For at least 6 cycles.NOTE: If each pattern of CAPE lasts >60 seconds, this would qualify as the presence of state changes. If CAPE is always present, cannot be interrupted with stimulation, and at least one of the states lasts <60 seconds, it remains possible for a patient to have CAPE and no state changes. 8. Voltage a. High: most or all activity ≥150 µV in longitudinal bipolar with standard 10–20 electrodes (measured from peak to trough). b. Normal. c. Low: most or all activity <20 µV in longitudinal bipolar with standard 10–20 electrodes (measured from peak to trough), but not qualifying as suppressed. d. Suppressed: all activity <10 µV. NOTE: If the background is nearly continuous or discontinuous, EEG background voltage refers to the higher voltage portion. 9. Anterior-Posterior (AP) Gradient An AP gradient is present if, at any point in the epoch, there is a clear and persistent (at least 1 continuous minute) anterior to posterior gradient of voltages and frequencies such that lower voltage, faster frequencies are seen in anterior derivations, and higher voltage, slower frequencies are seen in posterior derivations (Fig. 10). A reverse AP gradient is defined identically but with a posterior to anterior gradient of voltages and frequencies. a. Present. b. Absent. c. Present, but reversed. FIG. 10.: Anterior-posterior (AP) gradient.10. Breach Effect Breach effect refers to EEG activity over or nearby a skull defect and consists of activity of higher amplitude and increased sharpness, primarily of faster frequencies, compared with the rest of the brain, especially compared with the homologous region on the opposite side of the head. a. Present (provide location). b. Absent. c. Unclear. B. SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES This refers to nonrhythmic and nonperiodic spikes, polyspikes, and sharp waves, as previously defined by Kane et al.19 in the 2017 revised glossary of terms most commonly used by clinical electroencephalographers. A “spike” is defined as “a transient, clearly distinguished from background activity, with pointed peak at a conventional time scale and duration from 20 to <70 ms,” with duration measured at the EEG baseline (Fig. 11). A “sharp wave” is defined identically, but with a duration of 70 to 200 ms. A spike or sharp wave is usually diphasic or triphasic, apiculate (i.e., pointed peak), asymmetric (typically with a steeper ascending slope than descending, but can be the opposite), and either followed by a slow wave or associated with some other disruption of the background. A “polyspike” refers to 2 or more spikes occurring in a row with no interdischarge interval and lasting <0.5 seconds (if ≥0.5 seconds, they would either qualify as BIRDs [see section E below, page 24] or, if alternating with suppression or attenuation, a highly epileptiform burst within burst suppression/attenuation [see section A 4d, page 5] [Fig. 12]). The prevalence of epileptiform discharges (combining spikes, polyspikes and sharp waves) should be categorized as follows: a. Abundant: ≥1 per 10 seconds, but not periodic. FIG. 11.: Sporadic Epileptiform Discharges.FIG. 12.: Polyspike versus BIRDs versus Highly Epileptiform Bursts.NOTE: It can be helpful to record the estimated average and maximum number of spikes per 10-second epoch when abundant epileptiform discharges are seen. b. Frequent: ≥1/minute but less than 1 per 10 seconds c. Occasional: ≥1/hour but less than 1/minute d. Rare: <1/hour C. RHYTHMIC AND PERIODIC PATTERNS (RPPs) All terms consist of two main terms, with modifiers added as appropriate. Main term 1 refers to the localization of the pattern and main term 2 specifies the type of pattern. 1. Main Term 1: G, L, BI, UI, or Mf a. Generalized (G): any bilaterally synchronous and symmetric pattern (see Supp EEGs 5 and 6, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JCNP/A134) (Fig. 13), even if it has a restricted field (e.g., bifrontal). FIG. 13.: Generalized Periodic Discharges (GPDs). Generalized: Bilateral synchronous and symmetric periodic discharges. In this case, the pattern is “frontally predominant.”NOTE: A pattern that is bilateral with shifting predominance based on asymmetry (i.e., amplitude, sometimes higher on left and sometimes right), OR based on asynchrony (i.e., timing, sometimes earlier on the left and sometimes right) but is not consistently (>80% of the time) lateralized to one side would still be considered “Generalized.” With shifting asynchrony, one should specify the typical time lag between sides. NOTE: Some suggested that a more accurate term would be “bilateral synchronous,” but this was rejected for several reasons: 1. many lateralized patterns are also bilateral synchronous (see definition of “lateralized” immediately below); 2. this is more difficult to abbreviate (2 letters); and 3, the word “generalized” has been used widely to refer to patterns, discharges, seizures, and epilepsies that are not truly generalized. “Generalized” in this sense has also been used in many studies in the literature related to critical care EEG and in the previous version of this nomenclature. Thus, it was not changed. NOTE: Additional localizing information for Generalized patterns: i. “Frontally predominant”: Voltage in anterior derivations is at least 50% greater than that in posterior derivations on a common average, transverse bipolar, ipsilateral ear, or noncephalic referential recording (see Supp EEG 7, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.l","[""Lawrence J.

The Pantheon+ Analysis: Cosmological Constraints,"We present constraints on cosmological parameters from the Pantheon+ analysis of 1701 light curves of 1550 distinct Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) ranging in redshift from $z=0.001$ to 2.26. This work features an increased sample size, increased redshift span, and improved treatment of systematic uncertainties in comparison to the original Pantheon analysis and results in a factor of two improvement in cosmological constraining power. For a Flat$\Lambda$CDM model, we find $\Omega_M=0.334\pm0.018$ from SNe Ia alone. For a Flat$w_0$CDM model, we measure $w_0=-0.90\pm0.14$ from SNe Ia alone, H$_0=73.5\pm1.1$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ when including the Cepheid host distances and covariance (SH0ES), and $w_0=-0.978^{+0.024}_{-0.031}$ when combining the SN likelihood with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO); both $w_0$ values are consistent with a cosmological constant. We also present the most precise measurements to date on the evolution of dark energy in a Flat$w_0w_a$CDM universe, and measure $w_a=-0.1^{+0.9}_{-2.0}$ from Pantheon+ alone, H$_0=73.3\pm1.1$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ when including SH0ES, and $w_a=-0.65^{+0.28}_{-0.32}$ when combining Pantheon+ with CMB and BAO data. Finally, we find that systematic uncertainties in the use of SNe Ia along the distance ladder comprise less than one third of the total uncertainty in the measurement of H$_0$ and cannot explain the present ""Hubble tension"" between local measurements and early-Universe predictions from the cosmological model.","[""Dillon Brout"", ""D.

Factors Associated With US Adults’ Likelihood of Accepting COVID-19 Vaccination,"<h3>Importance</h3> The development of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine has progressed at unprecedented speed. Widespread public uptake of the vaccine is crucial to stem the pandemic. <h3>Objective</h3> To examine the factors associated with survey participants' self-reported likelihood of selecting and receiving a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> A survey study of a nonprobability convenience sample of 2000 recruited participants including a choice-based conjoint analysis was conducted to estimate respondents' probability of choosing a vaccine and willingness to receive vaccination. Participants were asked to evaluate their willingness to receive each hypothetical vaccine individually. The survey presented respondents with 5 choice tasks. In each, participants evaluated 2 hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines and were asked whether they would choose vaccine A, vaccine B, or neither vaccine. Vaccine attributes included efficacy, protection duration, major adverse effects, minor adverse effects, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, national origin of vaccine, and endorsement. Levels of each attribute for each vaccine were randomly assigned, and attribute order was randomized across participants. Survey data were collected on July 9, 2020. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Average marginal component effect sizes and marginal means were calculated to estimate the relationship between each vaccine attribute level and the probability of the respondent choosing a vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 1971 US adults responded to the survey (median age, 43 [interquartile range, 30-58] years); 999 (51%) were women, 1432 (73%) White, 277 (14%) were Black, and 190 (10%) were Latinx. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 70% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.06-0.09), and an increase from 50% to 90% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.15-0.18). An increase in protection duration from 1 to 5 years was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.05 95% CI, 0.04-0.07). A decrease in the incidence of major adverse effects from 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 1 000 000 was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05-0.08). An FDA emergency use authorization was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, −0.03; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.01) compared with full FDA approval. A vaccine that originated from a non-US country was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (China: −0.13 [95% CI, −0.15 to −0.11]; UK: −0.04 [95% CI, −0.06 to −0.02]). Endorsements from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (coefficient, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.07-0.11) and the World Health Organization (coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.04-0.08), compared with an endorsement from President Trump were associated with higher probabilities of choosing a vaccine. Analyses of participants' willingness to receive each vaccine when assessed individually yielded similar results. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 90% was associated with a 10% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.51 to 0.61). A reduction in the incidence of major side effects was associated with a 4% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.54 to 0.58). A vaccine originating in China was associated with a 10% lower willingness to receive a vaccine vs one developed in the US (from 0.60 to 0.50) Endorsements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization were associated with increases in willingness to receive a vaccine (7% and 6%, respectively) from a baseline endorsement by President Trump (from 0.52 to 0.59 and from 0.52 to 0.58, respectively). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> In this survey study of US adults, vaccine-related attributes and political characteristics were associated with self-reported preferences for choosing a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination. These results may help inform public health campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available.","[""Sarah Kreps"", ""Sandip M. Prasad"", ""John S.

"Estimated Global Proportions of Individuals With Persistent Fatigue, Cognitive, and Respiratory Symptom Clusters Following Symptomatic COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021","Some individuals experience persistent symptoms after initial symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (often referred to as Long COVID).To estimate the proportion of males and females with COVID-19, younger or older than 20 years of age, who had Long COVID symptoms in 2020 and 2021 and their Long COVID symptom duration.Bayesian meta-regression and pooling of 54 studies and 2 medical record databases with data for 1.2 million individuals (from 22 countries) who had symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 54 studies, 44 were published and 10 were collaborating cohorts (conducted in Austria, the Faroe Islands, Germany, Iran, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the US). The participant data were derived from the 44 published studies (10 501 hospitalized individuals and 42 891 nonhospitalized individuals), the 10 collaborating cohort studies (10 526 and 1906), and the 2 US electronic medical record databases (250 928 and 846 046). Data collection spanned March 2020 to January 2022.Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.Proportion of individuals with at least 1 of the 3 self-reported Long COVID symptom clusters (persistent fatigue with bodily pain or mood swings; cognitive problems; or ongoing respiratory problems) 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2020 and 2021, estimated separately for hospitalized and nonhospitalized individuals aged 20 years or older by sex and for both sexes of nonhospitalized individuals younger than 20 years of age.A total of 1.2 million individuals who had symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were included (mean age, 4-66 years; males, 26%-88%). In the modeled estimates, 6.2% (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 2.4%-13.3%) of individuals who had symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced at least 1 of the 3 Long COVID symptom clusters in 2020 and 2021, including 3.2% (95% UI, 0.6%-10.0%) for persistent fatigue with bodily pain or mood swings, 3.7% (95% UI, 0.9%-9.6%) for ongoing respiratory problems, and 2.2% (95% UI, 0.3%-7.6%) for cognitive problems after adjusting for health status before COVID-19, comprising an estimated 51.0% (95% UI, 16.9%-92.4%), 60.4% (95% UI, 18.9%-89.1%), and 35.4% (95% UI, 9.4%-75.1%), respectively, of Long COVID cases. The Long COVID symptom clusters were more common in women aged 20 years or older (10.6% [95% UI, 4.3%-22.2%]) 3 months after symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection than in men aged 20 years or older (5.4% [95% UI, 2.2%-11.7%]). Both sexes younger than 20 years of age were estimated to be affected in 2.8% (95% UI, 0.9%-7.0%) of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. The estimated mean Long COVID symptom cluster duration was 9.0 months (95% UI, 7.0-12.0 months) among hospitalized individuals and 4.0 months (95% UI, 3.6-4.6 months) among nonhospitalized individuals. Among individuals with Long COVID symptoms 3 months after symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, an estimated 15.1% (95% UI, 10.3%-21.1%) continued to experience symptoms at 12 months.This study presents modeled estimates of the proportion of individuals with at least 1 of 3 self-reported Long COVID symptom clusters (persistent fatigue with bodily pain or mood swings; cognitive problems; or ongoing respiratory problems) 3 months after symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","[""Sarah Wulf Hanson"", ""Cristiana Abbafati"", ""Joachim G.J.V.

2020 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Management of Gout,"To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage >3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (<40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of <6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3-6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.","[""John FitzGerald"", ""Nicola Dalbeth"", ""Ted R.

Cosmic Distances Calibrated to 1% Precision with Gaia EDR3 Parallaxes and Hubble Space Telescope Photometry of 75 Milky Way Cepheids Confirm Tension with ΛCDM,"We present an expanded sample of 75 Milky Way Cepheids with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry and Gaia EDR3 parallaxes which we use to recalibrate the extragalactic distance ladder and refine the determination of the Hubble constant. All HST observations were obtained with the same instrument (WFC3) and filters (F555W, F814W, F160W) used for imaging of extragalactic Cepheids in Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) hosts. The HST observations used the WFC3 spatial scanning mode to mitigate saturation and reduce pixel-to-pixel calibration errors, reaching a mean photometric error of 5 millimags per observation. We use new Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, vastly improved since DR2, and the Period-Luminosity (PL) relation of these Cepheids to simultaneously calibrate the extragalactic distance ladder and to refine the determination of the Gaia EDR3 parallax offset. The resulting geometric calibration of Cepheid luminosities has 1.0% precision, better than any alternative geometric anchor. Applied to the calibration of SNe~Ia, it results in a measurement of the Hubble constant of 73.0 +/- 1.4 km/sec/Mpc, in good agreement with conclusions based on earlier Gaia data releases. We also find the slope of the Cepheid PL relation in the Milky Way, and the metallicity dependence of its zeropoint, to be in good agreement with the mean values derived from other galaxies. In combination with the best complementary sources of Cepheid calibration, we reach 1.8% precision and find H_0=73.2 +/- 1.3 km/sec/Mpc, a 4.2 sigma difference with the prediction from Planck CMB observations under LambdaCDM. We expect to reach ~1.3% precision in the near term from an expanded sample of ~40 SNe Ia in Cepheid hosts.","[""Adam G. Riess"", ""Stefano Casertano"", ""Wenlong Yuan"", ""J.

Telomere-to-telomere assembly of a complete human X chromosome,"After two decades of improvements, the current human reference genome (GRCh38) is the most accurate and complete vertebrate genome ever produced. However, no single chromosome has been finished end to end, and hundreds of unresolved gaps persist1,2. Here we present a human genome assembly that surpasses the continuity of GRCh382, along with a gapless, telomere-to-telomere assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with complementary technologies for quality improvement and validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X chromosome3, we reconstructed the centromeric satellite DNA array (approximately 3.1 Mb) and closed the 29 remaining gaps in the current reference, including new sequences from the human pseudoautosomal regions and from cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and GAGE). These sequences will be integrated into future human reference genome releases. In addition, the complete chromosome X, combined with the ultra-long nanopore data, allowed us to map methylation patterns across complex tandem repeats and satellite arrays. Our results demonstrate that finishing the entire human genome is now within reach, and the data presented here will facilitate ongoing efforts to complete the other human chromosomes.","[""Karen H.

A draft human pangenome reference,"Here the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium presents a first draft of the human pangenome reference. The pangenome contains 47 phased, diploid assemblies from a cohort of genetically diverse individuals 1. These assemblies cover more than 99% of the expected sequence in each genome and are more than 99% accurate at the structural and base pair levels. Based on alignments of the assemblies, we generate a draft pangenome that captures known variants and haplotypes and reveals new alleles at structurally complex loci. We also add 119 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,115 gene duplications relative to the existing reference GRCh38. Roughly 90 million of the additional base pairs are derived from structural variation. Using our draft pangenome to analyse short-read data reduced small variant discovery errors by 34% and increased the number of structural variants detected per haplotype by 104% compared with GRCh38-based workflows, which enabled the typing of the vast majority of structural variant alleles per sample.","[""Wen\u2010Wei Liao"", ""Mobin Asri"", ""Jana Ebler"", ""Daniel Doerr"", ""Marina Haukness"", ""Glenn Hickey"", ""Shuangjia Lu"", ""Julian Lucas"", ""Jean Monlong"", ""Haley Abel"", ""Silvia Buonaiuto"", ""Xian Chang"", ""Haoyu Cheng"", ""Justin Chu"", ""Vincenza Colonna"", ""Jordan M.

Viral epitope profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals cross-reactivity and correlates of severity,"Understanding humoral responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for improving diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Deep serological profiling of 232 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and 190 pre–COVID-19 era controls using VirScan revealed more than 800 epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, including 10 epitopes likely recognized by neutralizing antibodies. Preexisting antibodies in controls recognized SARS-CoV-2 ORF1, whereas only COVID-19 patient antibodies primarily recognized spike protein and nucleoprotein. A machine learning model trained on VirScan data predicted SARS-CoV-2 exposure history with 99% sensitivity and 98% specificity; a rapid Luminex-based diagnostic was developed from the most discriminatory SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Individuals with more severe COVID-19 exhibited stronger and broader SARS-CoV-2 responses, weaker antibody responses to prior infections, and higher incidence of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus 1, possibly influenced by demographic covariates. Among hospitalized patients, males produce stronger SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses than females.","[""Ellen Shrock"", ""Eric Fujimura"", ""Tomasz Kula"", ""Richard T.

Liftoff: accurate mapping of gene annotations,"Improvements in DNA sequencing technology and computational methods have led to a substantial increase in the creation of high-quality genome assemblies of many species. To understand the biology of these genomes, annotation of gene features and other functional elements is essential; however, for most species, only the reference genome is well-annotated.One strategy to annotate new or improved genome assemblies is to map or 'lift over' the genes from a previously annotated reference genome. Here, we describe Liftoff, a new genome annotation lift-over tool capable of mapping genes between two assemblies of the same or closely related species. Liftoff aligns genes from a reference genome to a target genome and finds the mapping that maximizes sequence identity while preserving the structure of each exon, transcript and gene. We show that Liftoff can accurately map 99.9% of genes between two versions of the human reference genome with an average sequence identity >99.9%. We also show that Liftoff can map genes across species by successfully lifting over 98.3% of human protein-coding genes to a chimpanzee genome assembly with 98.2% sequence identity.Liftoff can be installed via bioconda and PyPI. In addition, the source code for Liftoff is available at https://github.com/agshumate/Liftoff.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","[""Alaina Shumate"", ""Steven L.

The Banff 2019 Kidney Meeting Report (I): Updates on and clarification of criteria for T cell– and antibody-mediated rejection,"The XV. Banff conference for allograft pathology was held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics in Pittsburgh, PA (USA) and focused on refining recent updates to the classification, advances from the Banff working groups, and standardization of molecular diagnostics. This report on kidney transplant pathology details clarifications and refinements to the criteria for chronic active (CA) T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR), borderline, and antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). The main focus of kidney sessions was on how to address biopsies meeting criteria for CA TCMR plus borderline or acute TCMR. Recent studies on the clinical impact of borderline infiltrates were also presented to clarify whether the threshold for interstitial inflammation in diagnosis of borderline should be i0 or i1. Sessions on ABMR focused on biopsies showing microvascular inflammation in the absence of C4d staining or detectable donor-specific antibodies; the potential value of molecular diagnostics in such cases and recommendations for use of the latter in the setting of solid organ transplantation are presented in the accompanying meeting report. Finally, several speakers discussed the capabilities of artificial intelligence and the potential for use of machine learning algorithms in diagnosis and personalized therapeutics in solid organ transplantation.","[""Alexandre Loupy"", ""Mark Haas"", ""Candice Roufosse"", ""Maarten Naesens"", ""Benjamin Adam"", ""Marjan Afrouzian"", ""Enver Akalin"", ""Nada Alachkar"", ""Serena M.

Health equity and COVID-19: global perspectives,"The COVID-19 is disproportionally affecting the poor, minorities and a broad range of vulnerable populations, due to its inequitable spread in areas of dense population and limited mitigation capacity due to high prevalence of chronic conditions or poor access to high quality public health and medical care. Moreover, the collateral effects of the pandemic due to the global economic downturn, and social isolation and movement restriction measures, are unequally affecting those in the lowest power strata of societies. To address the challenges to health equity and describe some of the approaches taken by governments and local organizations, we have compiled 13 country case studies from various regions around the world: China, Brazil, Thailand, Sub Saharan Africa, Nicaragua, Armenia, India, Guatemala, United States of America (USA), Israel, Australia, Colombia, and Belgium. This compilation is by no-means representative or all inclusive, and we encourage researchers to continue advancing global knowledge on COVID-19 health equity related issues, through rigorous research and generation of a strong evidence base of new empirical studies in this field.","[""Efrat Shadmi"", ""Yingyao Chen"", ""In\u00eas Dourado"", ""Inbal Faran-Perach"", ""John Furler"", ""Peter Hangoma"", ""Piya Hanvoravongchai"", ""Claudia Zea Obando"", ""Varduhi Petrosyan"", ""Krishna D.

Persistence and decay of human antibody responses to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in COVID-19 patients,"We measured plasma and/or serum antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in 343 North American patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (of which 93% required hospitalization) up to 122 days after symptom onset and compared them to responses in 1548 individuals whose blood samples were obtained prior to the pandemic. After setting seropositivity thresholds for perfect specificity (100%), we estimated sensitivities of 95% for IgG, 90% for IgA, and 81% for IgM for detecting infected individuals between 15 and 28 days after symptom onset. While the median time to seroconversion was nearly 12 days across all three isotypes tested, IgA and IgM antibodies against RBD were short-lived with median times to seroreversion of 71 and 49 days after symptom onset. In contrast, anti-RBD IgG responses decayed slowly through 90 days with only 3 seropositive individuals seroreverting within this time period. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were strongly correlated with anti-S neutralizing antibody titers, which demonstrated little to no decrease over 75 days since symptom onset. We observed no cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted antibodies with other widely circulating coronaviruses (HKU1, 229 E, OC43, NL63). These data suggest that RBD-targeted antibodies are excellent markers of previous and recent infection, that differential isotype measurements can help distinguish between recent and older infections, and that IgG responses persist over the first few months after infection and are highly correlated with neutralizing antibodies.","[""Anita Iyer"", ""Forrest K.

Early Remdesivir to Prevent Progression to Severe Covid-19 in Outpatients,"BACKGROUND Remdesivir improves clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with moderate-to-severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Whether the use of remdesivir in symptomatic, nonhospitalized patients with Covid-19 who are at high risk for disease progression prevents hospitalization is uncertain. METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving nonhospitalized patients with Covid-19 who had symptom onset within the previous 7 days and who had at least one risk factor for disease progression (age ≥60 years, obesity, or certain coexisting medical conditions). Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg on days 2 and 3) or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of Covid-19–related hospitalization or death from any cause by day 28. The primary safety end point was any adverse event. A secondary end point was a composite of a Covid-19–related medically attended visit or death from any cause by day 28. RESULTS A total of 562 patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of remdesivir or placebo were included in the analyses: 279 patients in the remdesivir group and 283 in the placebo group. The mean age was 50 years, 47.9% of the patients were women, and 41.8% were Hispanic or Latinx. The most common coexisting conditions were diabetes mellitus (61.6%), obesity (55.2%), and hypertension (47.7%). Covid-19–related hospitalization or death from any cause occurred in 2 patients (0.7%) in the remdesivir group and in 15 (5.3%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to 0.59; P=0.008). A total of 4 of 246 patients (1.6%) in the remdesivir group and 21 of 252 (8.3%) in the placebo group had a Covid-19–related medically attended visit by day 28 (hazard ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.56). No patients had died by day 28. Adverse events occurred in 42.3% of the patients in the remdesivir group and in 46.3% of those in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS Among nonhospitalized patients who were at high risk for Covid-19 progression, a 3-day course of remdesivir had an acceptable safety profile and resulted in an 87% lower risk of hospitalization or death than placebo.","[""Robert Gottlieb"", ""Carlos Vaca"", ""Roger Paredes"", ""Jorge Mera"", ""Brandon Webb"", ""Gilberto Perez"", ""Godson Oguchi"", ""Pablo Ryan"", ""Bibi Uhre Nielsen"", ""Martin M.

Proteogenomic Characterization Reveals Therapeutic Vulnerabilities in Lung Adenocarcinoma,"To explore the biology of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and identify new therapeutic opportunities, we performed comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of 110 tumors and 101 matched normal adjacent tissues (NATs) incorporating genomics, epigenomics, deep-scale proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and acetylproteomics. Multi-omics clustering revealed four subgroups defined by key driver mutations, country, and gender. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic data illuminated biology downstream of copy number aberrations, somatic mutations, and fusions and identified therapeutic vulnerabilities associated with driver events involving KRAS, EGFR, and ALK. Immune subtyping revealed a complex landscape, reinforced the association of STK11 with immune-cold behavior, and underscored a potential immunosuppressive role of neutrophil degranulation. Smoking-associated LUADs showed correlation with other environmental exposure signatures and a field effect in NATs. Matched NATs allowed identification of differentially expressed proteins with potential diagnostic and therapeutic utility. This proteogenomics dataset represents a unique public resource for researchers and clinicians seeking to better understand and treat lung adenocarcinomas.","[""Michael A.

"Etiology, Epidemiology, and Disparities in the Burden of Diabetic Foot Ulcers","Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are a major source of preventable morbidity in adults with diabetes. Consequences of foot ulcers include decline in functional status, infection, hospitalization, lower-extremity amputation, and death. The lifetime risk of foot ulcer is 19% to 34%, and this number is rising with increased longevity and medical complexity of people with diabetes. Morbidity following incident ulceration is high, with recurrence rates of 65% at 3–5 years, lifetime lower-extremity amputation incidence of 20%, and 5-year mortality of 50–70%. New data suggest overall amputation incidence has increased by as much as 50% in some regions over the past several years after a long period of decline, especially in young and racial and ethnic minority populations. DFU are a common and highly morbid complication of diabetes. The pathway to ulceration, involving loss of sensation, ischemia, and minor trauma, is well established. Amputation and mortality after DFU represent late-stage complications and are strongly linked to poor diabetes management. Current efforts to improve care of patients with DFU have not resulted in consistently lower amputation rates, with evidence of widening disparities and implications for equity in diabetes care. Prevention and early detection of DFU through guideline-directed multidisciplinary care is critical to decrease the morbidity and disparities associated with DFU. This review describes the epidemiology, presentation, and sequelae of DFU, summarizes current evidence-based recommendations for screening and prevention, and highlights disparities in care and outcomes.","[""Katherine M.

Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are the standard of care for the treatment of several cancers. While these immunotherapies have improved patient outcomes in many clinical settings, they bring accompanying risks of toxicity, specifically immune-related adverse events (irAEs). There is a need for clear, effective guidelines for the management of irAEs during ICI treatment, motivating the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) to convene an expert panel to develop a clinical practice guideline. The panel discussed the recognition and management of single and combination ICI irAEs and ultimately developed evidence- and consensus-based recommendations to assist medical professionals in clinical decision-making and to improve outcomes for patients.","[""Julie R.

The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR4 maps and cosmological parameters,"We present new arcminute-resolution maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropy from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, using data taken from 2013-2016 at 98 and 150 GHz. The maps cover more than 17,000 deg$^2$, the deepest 600 deg$^2$ with noise levels below 10 $\mu$K-arcmin. We use the power spectrum derived from almost 6,000 deg$^2$ of these maps to constrain cosmology. The ACT data enable a measurement of the angular scale of features in both the divergence-like polarization and the temperature anisotropy, tracing both the velocity and density at last-scattering. From these one can derive the distance to the last-scattering surface and thus infer the local expansion rate, $H_0$. By combining ACT data with large-scale information from WMAP we measure $H_0 = 67.6 \pm 1.1$ km/s/Mpc, at 68% confidence, in excellent agreement with the independently-measured Planck satellite estimate (from ACT alone we find $H_0 = 67.9 \pm 1.5$ km/s/Mpc). The $\Lambda$CDM model provides a good fit to the ACT data, and we find no evidence for deviations: both the spatial curvature, and the departure from the standard lensing signal in the spectrum, are zero to within 1$\sigma$; the number of relativistic species, the primordial Helium fraction, and the running of the spectral index are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM predictions to within $1.5 - 2.2\sigma$. We compare ACT, WMAP, and Planck at the parameter level and find good consistency; we investigate how the constraints on the correlated spectral index and baryon density parameters readjust when adding CMB large-scale information that ACT does not measure. The DR4 products presented here will be publicly released on the NASA Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis.","[""Simone Aiola"", ""Erminia Calabrese"", ""L.

ISUOG Practice Guidelines: diagnosis and management of small‐for‐gestational‐age fetus and fetal growth restriction,"The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) is a scientific organization that encourages sound clinical practice, and high-quality teaching and research related to diagnostic imaging in women's healthcare. The ISUOG Clinical Standards Committee (CSC) has a remit to develop Practice Guidelines and Consensus Statements as educational recommendations that provide healthcare practitioners with a consensus-based approach, from experts, for diagnostic imaging. They are intended to reflect what is considered by ISUOG to be the best practice at the time at which they are issued. Although ISUOG has made every effort to ensure that Guidelines are accurate when issued, neither the Society nor any of its employees or members accepts any liability for the consequences of any inaccurate or misleading data, opinions or statements issued by the CSC. The ISUOG CSC documents are not intended to establish a legal standard of care, because interpretation of the evidence that underpins the Guidelines may be influenced by individual circumstances, local protocol and available resources. Approved Guidelines can be distributed freely with the permission of ISUOG (info@isuog.org). The evaluation of fetal growth is one of the key objectives of prenatal care. Fetal growth depends on several factors, including uteroplacental function, maternal disease, maternal cardiovascular function or cardiac disease, maternal nutrition, altitude, smoking and illicit drug use, and presence of pathological conditions, such as infection, aneuploidy and some genetic conditions. However, uteroplacental insufficiency or dysfunction represents one of the most frequent causes of abnormal growth in an otherwise normal fetus. Impaired fetal growth is associated with an increased risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity, and long-term adverse infant outcome1. Overall, growth-restricted fetuses have a higher rate of conditions associated with prematurity2, experience worse neurodevelopmental outcome and are at increased risk of non-communicable diseases in adulthood, such as hypertension, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, Type-2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease and stroke3. Prenatal recognition of fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a major factor identified in strategies aimed at preventing stillbirth, in which up to 30% of cases are associated with FGR or small-for-gestational age (SGA) in the late third trimester4, 5. This Guideline provides definitions of FGR, previously referred to as intrauterine growth restriction, and SGA, and describes the best possible management options based on current data and knowledge. For the purposes of this Guideline, we assume that the pregnancy is singleton, pregnancy dating has been carried out correctly (preferably in the first trimester by ultrasound) and that there are no fetal pathologies, such as aneuploidy, congenital malformation or infection. Details of the grades of recommendation used in this Guideline are provided in Appendix 1. Reporting of levels of evidence is not applicable to this Guideline. Fetal growth is a dynamic process and its assessment requires multiple observations of fetal size over time. Fetal size is determined through biometric evaluation of the head circumference, biparietal diameter, abdominal circumference (AC) and femur length and/or derivation of estimated fetal weight (EFW) computed by different formulae. The ISUOG Guidelines on ultrasound assessment of fetal biometry and growth describe methodology, reference ranges, growth standards and quality-control processes for appropriate assessment of fetal biometry and diagnosis of fetal growth disorders6. Controversies in relation to reference ranges and other issues related to the assessment of fetal biometry are described in this Guideline. A fetus is considered to be SGA when its size (biometric evaluation) falls below a predefined threshold for its gestational age. The most common definition of SGA is EFW or AC below the 10th percentile of given reference ranges. Nevertheless, other thresholds have been described, such as the 5th and 3rd percentiles (the latter approximating to 2 SD) or a Z-score of –2. FGR is a condition that is frequently, but unhelpfully, defined as the fetus failing to reach its genetically predetermined growth potential. The identification of FGR is often not straightforward as fetal growth cannot be assessed through a single biometric evaluation of the fetal size, and growth potential is hypothetical. The main distinction between SGA and FGR is that a SGA fetus may be small but not at increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome, while a fetus with size above the 10th percentile may be FGR and at increased risk of adverse perinatal and long-term outcome7-11. Fetuses with birth weight below the 10th percentile are at increased risk of stillbirth12 and perinatal mortality13-15, with those with birth weight below the 3rd percentile being at the highest risk12, 13. For this reason, fetal size at the lower extreme of the growth charts, for example AC or EFW below the 3rd percentile for given growth charts, can be used as an isolated criterion to define FGR at any gestational epoch16. However, the optimal size at birth that is associated with the lowest perinatal mortality seems to be substantially higher than the median birth weight of a normal cohort13. In fact, a population-based cohort study found increased perinatal mortality even in fetuses with birth weight within the normal range, with those with birth weight between the 70th and 90th percentiles being at the lowest risk, and an inverse association between perinatal mortality and birth weight below the 80th percentile13. A large Scottish population-based cohort study demonstrated a progressive increase in the risk of stillbirth in pregnancies with a predicted birth weight below the 25th percentile17. In order to differentiate between SGA and FGR in cases in which the fetal size is below the 10th percentile, additional biophysical parameters are required. Many methods have been proposed for this purpose, such as evaluation of fetal growth velocity, use of customized growth charts, Doppler velocimetric evaluation of placental and fetal circulations and use of biomarkers. Some of these biophysical parameters are also used to monitor fetal status and/or as delivery decision criteria (e.g. umbilical artery (UA) Doppler). Biophysical tools, such as ductus venosus velocimetry, biophysical profile (BPP) scoring and cardiotocographic (CTG) assessment of fetal heart rate short-term variation (STV), are not used as diagnostic criteria for FGR but for the surveillance and management of pregnancies already diagnosed as FGR, and are discussed below. There are several methods to evaluate fetal growth velocity, including use of longitudinal growth charts18, assessment of deviation from growth-velocity charts18 and individualized growth assessment19. Overall, the objective is to evaluate the fetal growth trajectory and identify those fetuses that are deviating from their individual trajectory, indicating a failure to reach their growth potential. There is evidence to suggest that reduced fetal growth velocity in the third trimester is associated with increased risk of adverse outcome11, 20. Reduced growth velocity is normally taken to be a fall between consecutive ultrasound scans of > 50 percentiles for AC or, more commonly, EFW6. In customized charts, the fetal weight and growth are adjusted for variables known to impact fetal size. These can include maternal height, weight, age, parity and ethnicity and fetal sex. Adjustment for these variables is suggested to allow for better identification of SGA fetuses at risk of perinatal complications6. Methods to evaluate fetal growth velocity and application of customized growth charts for this purpose are described in more detail in the ISUOG Guidelines on ultrasound assessment of fetal biometry and growth6. The rationale behind the application of Doppler velocimetry in fetal growth assessment is that it can identify uteroplacental function through evaluation of the uterine and umbilical arteries. Uteroplacental insufficiency is putatively mediated through spiral artery maladaptation and alterations in the villous vascular tree. On the fetal side, Doppler velocimetry allows evaluation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and ductus venosus as fetal cardiovascular adaptation progresses from hypoxia to acidemia. A lack of physiological transformation of the uterine arteries from high- to low-resistance vessels is thought to reflect inadequate trophoblastic invasion of the spiral arteries, leaving a high-resistance circulation. The persistence of high uterine artery mean pulsatility index (PI) (above the 95th percentile) is associated with placental insufficiency and maternal vascular malperfusion of the placenta21. Progressively increasing PI in the UA corresponds to a progressive reduction in the placental surface area available for gas and nutrient exchange and increased fetal afterload resistance, and is associated with placental vascular insufficiency reflected by absent and, in the end-stage phase, reversed end-diastolic flow (EDF) in the UA22. Reduced fetal MCA-PI is a consequence of vasodilatation, the so called ‘brain-sparing’ effect. This represents a hemodynamic response to fetal hypoxemia, via direct vascular sensing of oxygen tension in the cerebral circuit, and in other vascular beds a consequent redistribution of fetal cardiac output occurs preferentially to the coronary arteries and adrenal glands23. Alterations in the ductus venosus flow velocity waveform, especially absent or reversed a-wave, are caused by progressive dilatation of the ductus venosus isthmus in order to increase the blood flow toward the heart, in an attempt to compensate for extreme oxygen deprivation24. Others consider that absent or reversed a-wave in the ductus venosus is a consequence of increased intra-atrial pressure due to high cardiac afterload (increased vascular placental resistance) and/or a direct effect of fetal acidemia on myocardial cell function25. Doppler velocimetry plays a central role in identification, surveillance and management of FGR, because it allows for the identification of uteroplacental insufficiency and/or fetal cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxemia. Importantly, the two phenotypes of FGR, early-onset and late-onset, are characterized by different Doppler velocimetry patterns, as discussed below. The BPP score consists of the combined evaluation of fetal tone, gross body movement, breathing movement, amniotic fluid volume and heart-rate reactivity. BPP score can predict both fetal pH and outcome26, 27. The relationship between altered BPP score and fetal pH seems to be consistent across gestational ages26. A score of ≤ 4 is associated with a fetal pH ≤ 7.20, while a score of < 2 has a sensitivity of 100% for acidemia27. This correlation remains highly significant even when using a simplified BPP that is based on assessment of only fetal heart rate and amniotic fluid volume28. A reactive CTG virtually excludes fetal hypoxemia. The fetal heart rate STV is a biophysical parameter obtained by computerized CTG (cCTG) that reflects autonomic nervous system function. In the context of FGR and the accompanying presence of severe hypoxemia or hypoxia, the fetal sympathetic and parasympathetic activity is altered, resulting in reduced fetal heart rate variation, and, thus, reduced STV. cCTG and evaluation of STV have been validated against invasive testing in fetal hypoxemia and acidemia and represent the only objective measure of fetal heart rate29. Visual inspection of conventional CTG does not provide the same information as cCTG, as CTG represents a largely subjective assessment with low intra- and interobserver reproducibility. Placental biomarkers have a potential role in screening, diagnosis and therapy of placental disease linked to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and/or FGR30. Several placental factors have been investigated, including placental proteins as well as microRNA and mRNA. Some placental proteins, such as pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, are biomarkers of placental function in the first trimester, though its predictive ability is limited31, 32. The soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) to placental growth factor (PlGF) ratio has been proposed as a short-term predictor to rule out pre-eclampsia in women in whom this condition is suspected clinically33. Although some reports suggest that use of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio might be helpful in the management of and differentiation between SGA and FGR34-38, the lack of interventional trial data precludes the recommendation of these tests as an adjunct to ultrasound imaging. The rapidly evolving research-based discussion of the use of biomarkers in screening for SGA and FGR is beyond the scope of this Guideline. There are two main phenotypes of FGR which differ significantly in many aspects, such as prevalence, prediction by first-trimester ultrasound, gestational age at onset, placental histopathological findings, Doppler velocimetric profile, maternal associated disease, severity and perinatal outcome. Table 1 presents the main characteristics of the two phenotypes, which are defined as early-onset and late-onset FGR based on the observation that one phenotype is more frequent in early gestation and the second near term39-42. The distinction between early and late FGR is usually based on diagnosis before or after 32–34 weeks' gestation. Although UA Doppler evaluation seems to discriminate better than gestational age between the two phenotypes of FGR with regards to their association with pre-eclampsia and adverse perinatal outcome39, 40, 32 weeks seems to be the optimal gestational-age cut-off at diagnosis and provides a reasonable classification of the two FGR phenotypes40. This gestational-age threshold, therefore, is largely agreed upon as the main criterion to differentiate between early and late FGR16 and is used to distinguish between early- and late-onset FGR in this Guideline. The definition of FGR varies between different guidelines and author groups43. The criteria proposed by an international Delphi consensus represent the most recognized definition of FGR (Table 2)16. In a recent validation study, the performance of these criteria was compared to that of a FGR definition of EFW < 10th percentile using the Hadlock growth standard, in predicting adverse neonatal outcome44. The study cohort spanned a wide gestational-age range and the two definitions had comparable performance, though the Delphi criteria were associated with an improved prediction of adverse neonatal outcome. Despite the fact that Doppler velocimetry has been used in obstetric practice for nearly four decades, there is no universal agreement on which indices, thresholds and/or reference ranges to use. These considerations are not applicable when qualitative assessment is performed, such as evaluation of absent/reversed ductus venosus a-wave or absent/reversed EDF in the UA, but they affect Doppler velocimetry quantitative evaluation. International guidance on how to perform uteroplacental and fetal Doppler velocimetry is provided by ISUOG45. There is considerable methodological heterogeneity in studies reporting reference ranges for MCA and UA Doppler indices and their ratio, which may, at least partly, explain the differences in reported reference ranges46. Even among studies with a high methodological quality score, there are significant differences in the definition of ‘normality’ and normal ranges46. A recent study evaluating the 10 most-cited articles providing reference ranges for MCA-PI, UA-PI and cerebroplacental ratio (CPR), found wide discrepancies in Doppler reference values that accounted for a variability of up to 50% in the 5th percentile cut-off value of MCA-PI at term47. Similarly, the study found significant differences in the cut-off for UA-PI above the 95th percentile (20–40%) and CPR below the 5th percentile (15–35%)47. Wide discrepancies have been reported in reference ranges used for biometry, Doppler parameters and birth weight, even at national level in centers with high expertise in the management of FGR, that might significantly impact the diagnosis and management of FGR48. Another reason for the lack of standardization of quantitative Doppler velocimetry is that there is no uniformity in Doppler indices that are used, especially in research studies. For example, cerebral blood-flow redistribution can be defined as MCA-PI below different percentile thresholds (5th or 10th percentile), Z-scores or multiples of the median (MoM), or it can be defined as umbilicocerebral ratio (UCR) or CPR above or below different percentile thresholds, Z-scores or MoM, respectively49. The Delphi consensus procedure identified CPR below the 5th percentile and UA-PI above the 95th percentile as Doppler criteria to define FGR16. The rationale behind the application of the ratios of MCA-PI and UA-PI (CPR and UCR), instead of the individual components, is that they have been shown to be more sensitive to fetal hypoxia50 and to be associated more strongly with adverse perinatal outcome49, 51. CPR is reported in studies more frequently than is UCR. A recent study suggested that UCR may allow for better differentiation of cases in the abnormal range in early FGR, as compared with CPR52. However, it should be highlighted that there is no strong evidence in favor of either ratio. The high variability in Doppler reference ranges and indices used has a major clinical impact on prenatal diagnosis, monitoring, timing of delivery decision, reproducibility and comparison of findings between research studies, efficacy of clinical policies and protocols, and many other aspects46. The discussion about which reference ranges to use for the diagnosis and management of FGR is beyond the scope of this Guideline. However, these differences should be acknowledged and action is needed to homogenize the adoption of Doppler indices, thresholds and reference ranges in clinical and research practice. Table S1 summarizes the most relevant studies reporting reference charts for MCA and its ratios. Early FGR is particularly associated with maternal vascular malperfusion of the placenta, characterized by abnormal transformation of the spiral arteries, pathologic features of the placental villi and multifocal infarction; these disease components result in so-called ‘placental insufficiency’ and form the most common basis for placenta-mediated FGR53, 54. Chronic ischemia of the placental villi impairs PlGF secretion and leads to excessive sFlt-1 release by syncytial knots, thus resulting in elevated sFlt-1/PlGF ratio which typifies early FGR and the associated hypertensive disorders of pregnancy34-38. Elevated Doppler UA-PI typically precedes a cascade of Doppler alterations, fetal heart rate changes and BPP modifications, with end-stage cardiovascular deterioration caused by severe hypoxemia followed by acidosis55-57. Uterine artery, UA and MCA Doppler abnormalities represent early changes in early FGR and may be present for many weeks before severe cardiovascular and metabolic deterioration occurs. Although absent UA-EDF represents a progressive deterioration of uteroplacental function, it still precedes critical fetal deterioration, and the progression to reversed UA-EDF might be slow. However, the rate and rapidity of alteration in UA Doppler, from increased blood-flow resistance to absent EDF, determines the rate of fetal deterioration56, 58. The late deterioration in early FGR characterized by severe placental insufficiency is reflected by reversal of the EDF in the UA, and worsening generalized cardiovascular and metabolic failure reflected by alterations in the ductus venosus (absent or reversed a-wave)57, 59. This cardiovascular deterioration might precede or occur in parallel with the alteration of the STV, eventually manifesting as abnormal BPP score, spontaneous repetitive decelerations on CTG and stillbirth39, 60. At present, there is no effective therapy for early FGR, though efficient recognition and management of severe pre-eclampsia may prolong some pregnancies with early FGR. The timely use of steroids, followed by magnesium sulfate, transfer to a tertiary care center and consideration of the safest mode of delivery, are the key concepts in early-FGR management61. Ultimately, delivery represents the only therapeutic option in early FGR, in order to prevent severe consequences from hypoxia and acidosis that can lead to perinatal morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, the decision to deliver has to be balanced against the possible harm caused by prematurity62, 63. This is further complicated by the fact that the fetus is suffering from growth restriction, which is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes associated with prematurity, thus making the outcome even more unfavorable64, 65. This is highlighted by the fact that, in fetuses with early FGR, neonatal survival first exceeds 50% after 26 weeks' gestation, which is 2 weeks later than in their appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) counterparts55. In this view, optimal monitoring and timing of delivery are of crucial importance when managing early FGR. Once early FGR is suspected/diagnosed, the pregnancy should be monitored and managed in tertiary-level fetal medicine and neonatal units according to a uniform management protocol66. Multidisciplinary counseling by neonatology and maternal–fetal medicine specialists is important. Evidence from a randomized trial (Trial of Randomized Umbilical and Fetal Flow in Europe (TRUFFLE)) shows that monitoring and delivery timing according to a specific protocol including ductus venosus Doppler and cCTG provides better-than-expected outcomes66. It should be taken into account that cCTG is not available or used universally. In that case, in addition to Doppler evaluation, assessment of conventional CTG and, where undertaken, BPP scoring should be performed27. The loss of fetal gross body movement in association with ductus venosus Doppler index alterations can predict fetal cord pH < 7.20, while loss of fetal tone is associated with pH < 7.00 or a base excess < −12 mEq/L27. The surveillance frequency should be based on the severity of FGR and UA abnormalities. Progressive deterioration of UA Doppler velocimetry warrants more intensive monitoring every 2–3 days when absent or reversed UA-EDF is present. There is no consensus on monitoring frequency, however, suggested management strategies have been described elsewhere29, 42, 67. MCA Doppler is one of the first parameters that becomes abnormal in early FGR. There seems to be a weak association between low MCA-PI and adverse short-term neonatal outcome and between low MCA-PI and high UCR and 2-year adverse neurodevelopmental outcome52. However, gestational age at delivery and birth weight have the most pronounced impact on these outcomes52. Thus, MCA Doppler seems to guide monitoring before 32 weeks of gestation but there is no evidence that it should be used to determine delivery timing. Around 70% of women with early FGR will develop hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, mainly pre-eclampsia68. Thus, regular blood-pressure assessment, and monitoring of urinary protein/creatinine ratio and baseline renal–hepatic function in asymptomatic women with early FGR are recommended. Although maternal PlGF testing might be useful69, the value of biomarkers in the diagnosis and management of FGR in the absence of maternal hypertension remains undefined. All available guidelines on early FGR recommend corticosteroid prophylaxis to prevent neonatal respiratory distress syndrome if the birth is likely to occur before 34 + 0 weeks43, 67, 70-74. However, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) recommends corticosteroid prophylaxis up to 35 + 6 weeks67. Despite this recommendation, it is worth noting that no randomized trial has been performed in order to establish whether the benefits of corticosteroids in premature fetuses also apply to premature growth-restricted fetuses, in whom the reduced metabolism of corticosteroids by a smaller placenta and the already high level of endogenous adrenal corticosteroids might further damage the white matter of the brain and myelination75. In fetuses with absent or reversed UA-EDF, enhanced daily surveillance is warranted during steroid administration76. There is good evidence for the efficacy of magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection in the context of preterm delivery, however, the exact gestational-age threshold at which this attenuates remains unclear77. Many guidelines and studies recommend magnesium sulfate prophylaxis for neuroprotection in growth-restricted fetuses, though the suggested time of commencement varies, being < 32–33 weeks73, < 32 weeks70, 72, < 30 weeks78 or < 29 weeks' gestation79. In the absence of strong evidence regarding the optimum gestational age of magnesium sulfate prophylaxis that would allow for uniform application among countries, we recommend to refer to local or national guidelines. A large prospective international multicenter study provided evidence that early gestational age at delivery and low birth weight are the primary quantifying parameters that adversely impact on the neonatal outcome of fetuses with early-onset FGR55. Indeed, for extreme prematurity (< 27 weeks) and extremely low birth weight (< 600 g), each day of prolongation of the pregnancy improves neonatal survival by 2%. After 27 weeks, ductus venosus Doppler parameters emerged as the primary predictor of neonatal outcome55. The first randomized controlled trial on timing of delivery in FGR was the Growth Restriction Intervention Trial (GRIT)80, 81. The study evaluated the effect of immediate delivery vs expectant management when the clinicians were uncertain about the optimal timing of delivery of a compromised fetus. The median time to delivery was 4.9 days in the expectant-management group compared with 0.9 days in the immediate-delivery arm, and there was no significant difference in neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years or at school age between the two groups82. The TRUFFLE study is the largest randomized trial on timing of delivery in early FGR and was based on three randomization arms: early ductus venosus Doppler changes (PI > 95th percentile), late ductus venosus Doppler changes (a-wave at or below baseline) and reduced fetal heart rate STV on cCTG (< 3.5 ms before 29 weeks and < 4.0 ms thereafter)83. In addition, in all three arms, safety-net criteria were applied as an absolute indication for delivery, and were represented by spontaneous repeated persistent unprovoked fetal heart rate decelerations in all three arms or by STV < 2.6 ms at 26 + 0 to 28 + 6 weeks and < 3.0 ms at 29 + 0 to 31 + 6 weeks in the ductus venosus arms. The protocol recommended delivery if reversed UA-EDF occurred after 30 weeks or if there was absent UA-EDF after 32 weeks. Overall, the TRUFFLE study provided evidence that timing of delivery based on ductus venosus Doppler measurement in conjunction with cCTG safety-net criteria improves long-term (2-year) neurodevelopmental outcome in surviving infants. The cCTG STV ‘safety net’ was deliberately set at a level below that of the two ductus venosus randomized groups. Figure 1 presents the protocol recommended by the TRUFFLE study for monitoring and managing pregnancies with early FGR66. Despite the fact that data from the TRUFFLE study showed better-than-expected results in terms of infant survival without neurological impairment (82% of children), the gestational age at study entry and at delivery and birth weight were strongly related to adverse outcome. It is important to highlight that outcomes similar to that of the TRUFFLE trial can be replicated only by using the monitoring strategy and delivery-decision criteria based on ductus venosus Doppler and cCTG in conjunction. If cCTG is not available or not used, delivery timing should be based on combination of Doppler velocimetry indices (mainly ductus venosus before 30 weeks) and conventional CTG, or BPP where this is undertaken. The presence of repeated spontaneous unprovoked decelerations is an indication for delivery. However, when visually interpreting the fetal heart reactivity on conventional CTG, the gestational age and corresponding fetal maturity should be taken into account. Similarly, an absolute indication for delivery is maternal condition (e.g. severe pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome) or obstetric emergency conditions, such as placental abruption. Considering the strong association with severe placental insufficiency and fetal hypoxemia/hypoxia, planned Cesarean section is indicated in the majority of early-onset cases of FGR. Importantly, delivery is indicated based on maternal indications, mainly hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, that could adversely impact the perinatal and maternal outcome68. Delivery should be based on biophysical assessments or maternal indication, as follows: ≥ 26 + 0 weeks, deliver if any of the following is present: The pathophysiology of late FGR differs from that of early FGR. Late FGR is characterized by milder and more aspecific placental lesions and/or alteration in oxygen and nutrient diffusion84, 85. Consequently, alterations in UA Doppler and venous districts are rare and fail to identify the vast majority of late-FGR cases or to predict adverse outcome in these fetuses40. Several studies have found an association between MCA vasodilatation (i.e. reduction in MCA-PI) or the alteration of its ratio with UA-PI and poorer perinatal outcome86, including stillbirth39, higher risk of Cesarean delivery87-89, and increased risk of abnormal neurodevelopment at birt","[""C.

"Comprehensive analysis of chromothripsis in 2,658 human cancers using whole-genome sequencing","Chromothripsis is a mutational phenomenon characterized by massive, clustered genomic rearrangements that occurs in cancer and other diseases. Recent studies in selected cancer types have suggested that chromothripsis may be more common than initially inferred from low-resolution copy-number data. Here, as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we analyze patterns of chromothripsis across 2,658 tumors from 38 cancer types using whole-genome sequencing data. We find that chromothripsis events are pervasive across cancers, with a frequency of more than 50% in several cancer types. Whereas canonical chromothripsis profiles display oscillations between two copy-number states, a considerable fraction of events involve multiple chromosomes and additional structural alterations. In addition to non-homologous end joining, we detect signatures of replication-associated processes and templated insertions. Chromothripsis contributes to oncogene amplification and to inactivation of genes such as mismatch-repair-related genes. These findings show that chromothripsis is a major process that drives genome evolution in human cancer.","[""Isidro Cort\u00e9s\u2010Ciriano"", ""Jake June-Koo Lee"", ""Ruibin Xi"", ""Dhawal Jain"", ""Youngsook L.

Management of Immune-Related Adverse Events in Patients Treated With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy: ASCO Guideline Update,"To increase awareness, outline strategies, and offer guidance on the recommended management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy.A multidisciplinary panel of medical oncology, dermatology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, pulmonology, endocrinology, neurology, hematology, emergency medicine, nursing, trialists, and advocacy experts was convened to update the guideline. Guideline development involved a systematic literature review and an informal consensus process. The systematic review focused on evidence published from 2017 through 2021.A total of 175 studies met the eligibility criteria of the systematic review and were pertinent to the development of the recommendations. Because of the paucity of high-quality evidence, recommendations are based on expert consensus.Recommendations for specific organ system-based toxicity diagnosis and management are presented. While management varies according to the organ system affected, in general, ICPi therapy should be continued with close monitoring for grade 1 toxicities, except for some neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxicities. ICPi therapy may be suspended for most grade 2 toxicities, with consideration of resuming when symptoms revert ≤ grade 1. Corticosteroids may be administered. Grade 3 toxicities generally warrant suspension of ICPis and the initiation of high-dose corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be tapered over the course of at least 4-6 weeks. Some refractory cases may require other immunosuppressive therapy. In general, permanent discontinuation of ICPis is recommended with grade 4 toxicities, except for endocrinopathies that have been controlled by hormone replacement. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines.","[""Bryan J.

Data on AKI are either lacking1 or only reporting incidence on the basis of case series and retrospective studies.2 In this Perspective, we emphasize that AKI can be a severe complication of COVID-19 and highlight the importance of assessing, defining, and reporting the course of AKI. Understandably relevant information that normally would be part of clinical descriptions and research publications has not been collected because of the magnitude and accelerated pace of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of great relevance is a preprint in medRxiv reporting a 23% AKI incidence among 85 patients (over 60% in high-risk patients). The authors analyzed kidney histology from autopsies of six patients who had AKI showing severe acute tubular necrosis with lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration, but it is not clear from this report if these patients had actually developed cortical necrosis (B. Diao, C.H. Wang, R.S. Wang, Z.Q. Feng, Y.J. Tan, H.M. Wang, et al.: Human kidney is a target for novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection [preprint posted online April 10, 2020]. medRxivdoi:10.1101/2020.03.04.20031120). An important report on autopsy findings from deceased patients with COVID-19 again demonstrated prominent acute proximal tubular injury, but also peritubular erythrocyte aggregation and glomerular fibrin thrombi with ischemic collapse.3 This paper also reported endothelial damage, hemosiderin deposition, pigment casts related to rhabdomyolysis, and inflammation. Notably, some of these patients lacked evidence of AKI as detected by routine measures (creatinine and/or BUN), highlighting the possibility of substantial subclinical kidney injury. Recent clinical and autopsy reports of COVID-19 from China and the United States confirm increased clotting and disseminated intravascular coagulation with small vessel thrombosis and pulmonary infarction.4 Further, elevated d-dimer and low platelet levels correlated with worse outcomes.4 We are aware that some patients with COVID-19 manifest evidence of microangiopathy in other organ systems, such as splenic infarction or presenting symptoms of loin pain and hematuria suggesting renal infarction. Numerous observations by treating physicians attest that there is increased occurrence of circuit clotting in patients with COVID-19 undergoing dialysis. COVID-19 is also associated with increased myocardial injury that mimics myocardial infarction, possibly from myocarditis and microangiopathy.5 Thus, it is conceivable that the hypercoagulable state that appears to be a characteristic complication of severe COVID-19 could, in some cases, foster the evolution of acute tubular necrosis to cortical necrosis and, therefore, irreversible kidney failure. Innate immunity and coagulation pathways are intricately linked.6 COVID-19–associated macrophage activation, hyperferritinemia, cytokine storm, and release of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular proteins can result in release of tissue factor and activation of coagulation factors that create a predisposition to hypercoagulability.6 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may also target lymphocytes as they express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), leading to lymphocyte activation and, consequently, activation-induced cell death than can result in lymphopenia of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.7 Further, procoagulation pathways and complement systems can activate each other. In support of this interaction in COVID-19, Diao and colleagues (B. Diao, C.H. Wang, R.S. Wang, Z.Q. Feng, Y.J. Tan, H.M. Wang, et al.: Human kidney is a target for novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection [preprint posted online April 10, 2020]. medRxivdoi:10.1101/2020.03.04.20031120) observed strong complement C5b-9 (membrane attack complex) deposition in renal tubules of six patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting activation of the complement pathway. An interaction between angiotensin II (AngII) overactivity, innate/adaptive immune and complement pathways, and the coagulation system could influence AKI severity and outcomes. Inflammation-induced erythrocyte aggregation (reflected as elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and heme-mediated pathology may worsen oxidative stress, inflammation, and complement activation, to aggravate microvascular injury.8 Further, organ crosstalk between the injured lung, the heart, and the kidney can worsen pathology. Detailed studies to decipher the nature of coagulation dysfunction, microangiopathy, and potential role for innate immune and complement pathways are required to gain further insights regarding kidney pathology in COVID-19. Also of interest is the finding that SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was observed in tubular structures in the kidneys from the six patients examined, and nucleocapsid protein–positive inclusion bodies were also observed in the cytoplasm (B. Diao, C.H. Wang, R.S. Wang, Z.Q. Feng, Y.J. Tan, H.M. Wang, et al.: Human kidney is a target for novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection [preprint posted online April 10, 2020]. medRxivdoi:10.1101/2020.03.04.20031120). Su et al.3 similarly observed the presence of virus-like particles in podocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells by electron microscopy, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein antibody stained renal tubular epithelia positive, but the specificity of the antibody used needs to be established. Although, as far as we know, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, has not been detected in the kidney, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could directly infect human kidney tubules and induce cytoplasmic renal tubular inclusions, a feature observed in other virus-associated nephropathies. Thus, although AKI may be attributable to hypotension and decreased kidney perfusion secondary to hemodynamic or hemostatic factors or associated sepsis, one needs to consider that viral infection of the kidneys with viral replication directly in kidney parenchyma also plays a role. The main binding site for SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, is the ACE2 protein, which is expressed in the kidney much more than the lungs.9,10 ACE2 is expressed on the brush border apical membrane of the proximal tubule, where it colocalizes with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and is also present at lower levels in podocytes.10 It is conceivable that the virus could enter the kidney by invading podocytes first, and thus gain access to the tubular fluid and subsequently bind to ACE2 in the proximal tubule. In primary human airway epithelia, ACE2 is expressed apically, and SARS-CoV-2 infection predominantly occurs on the apical surface, but infection can occur on the basolateral surface at low efficiency.11 Coronavirus entry into host target cells also requires fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. Fusion-activated SARS-CoV peptides are created by specific proteolytic cleavage of the S proteins, in a step called ""priming."" As a consequence, cell infectivity not only depends on ACE2 expression, but is also governed by types of proteases found in a given cell type. In the kidney, Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)12–1314 (Figure 1), which primes the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, is robustly expressed in the distal nephron rather than the proximal tubule. It remains to be determined if other TMPRSS in the proximal tubule can mediate the priming step, such as TMPRSS 4, 5, or 9. Alternatively, tropism of SARS-CoV-2 might be expanded by the unique furin cleavage site in the Spike protein that is processed during biogenesis.14Figure 1.: Single-cell RNA of SARS-COV-2 receptor (ACE2) and known priming proteases in the kidney. There is no clear correspondence in single-cell RNA between ACE2 and TMPRSS2. EC, endothelial cell; PT, proximal tubule (S1, Segment one; S2 Segment two, S3 Segment three); LH(DL), loop of henle(descending thin limb); LH(AL), loop of henle(descending limb type one [#type 1] and type two [type #2]); DCT, distal convoluted tubule; CNT, connecting tubule; PC, principal cell; IC-A, alpha intercalated cell; IC-B, beta intercalated cell; pct. exp, percentexpressed. Data were extracted with permission from human kidney single-cell RNA-sequencing data.12 , 13Any effect of proteinuria, hyperinflammation, or tubular injury on proximal tubular ACE2 expression or SARS-CoV-2 viral entry is currently unknown. Viral replication in podocytes and the ensuing damage could in theory account for the proteinuria that has been reported in patients with COVID-19.2 Further, COVID-19–associated hemophagocytic macrophage activation and microangiopathy could also cause AKI and podocyte damage. Of interest, cases of COVID-19–associated collapsing glomerulopathy have been described.15 Regardless of direct viral infection of the kidney, AngII is likely increased in the context of acute lung injury16 and there is evidence that ACE2 is downregulated in AKI. This may lead to type 1 angiotensin receptor activation as well as decreased angiotensin (1–7) formation and subsequent worsening of AKI. This is particularly important in subpopulations of patients who have CKD, especially those with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). ACE2 and ACE mRNA and protein expression are altered in mouse models of DKD and in patients with DKD.10,17 Thus, patients with CKD, especially those with DKD, who develop COVID-19 may be at higher risk of AKI because of baseline upregulation of the ACE and downregulation of ACE2, a combination that primes a proinflammatory (including complement activation) and profibrotic state in the kidneys. Interestingly, a recent study described single-cell transcriptome analysis in 15 normal human kidney samples.18 In this study, the proportions of kidney cells expressing ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 binding site, and proteases of the TMPRSS family were compared between occidental and Asian individuals.18 Interestingly, the expression of ACE2 and kidney disease–related genes was higher in occidental donors relative to Asian donors. This would suggest that the susceptibility to kidney injury from coronavirus infection might be higher in individuals of occidental rather than Asian descent. We are not aware, however, of data supporting this possibility. Despite the very limited information on kidney involvement in COVID-19, AKI appears to involve a complex process driven by virus-mediated injury, cytokine storm, AngII pathway activation, dysregulation of complement, hypercoagulation, and microangiopathy interacting with common and known risk factors for AKI (Figure 2). There is paucity of data regarding clinical and laboratory characteristics of AKI in patients with COVID-19. We urge that further studies describing and analyzing the clinical course of patients with COVID-19 include appropriate indices of kidney function and diagnosis of AKI in their analyses, including kidney injury markers, urine microscopy, quantified urine protein, urine output, and urine electrolytes. Markers of macrophage activation, coagulation, microangiopathy, and complement activation, as well as kidney imaging and need for KRT (with relevant details), are important data needed to further our understanding of AKI pathophysiology associated with COVID-19. Rates of reversibility of, or partial improvement in, kidney function and any kidney biopsy results (including immunofluorescence and electron microscopy) should be reported. In the rush to report medical complications of COVID-19, we are missing valuable clinical information. Speculation about specific interventions would not be appropriate until we obtain appropriate information. We advocate for a complete and standardized appraisal of the clinical and laboratory picture so that preventative and therapeutic strategies for AKI can be appropriately designed and implemented.Figure 2.: Targeting of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 results in angiotensin dysregulation, innate and adaptive immune pathway activation, and hypercoagulation to result in organ injury and AKI associated with COVID-19. Organ crosstalk between the injured lungs, the heart, and the kidney may further propagate injury.

2020 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Management of Reproductive Health in Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases,"Objective To develop an evidence‐based guideline on contraception, assisted reproductive technologies ( ART ), fertility preservation with gonadotoxic therapy, use of menopausal hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ), pregnancy assessment and management, and medication use in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease ( RMD ). Methods We conducted a systematic review of evidence relating to contraception, ART , fertility preservation, HRT , pregnancy and lactation, and medication use in RMD populations, using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology to rate the quality of evidence and a group consensus process to determine final recommendations and grade their strength (conditional or strong). Good practice statements were agreed upon when indirect evidence was sufficiently compelling that a formal vote was unnecessary. Results This American College of Rheumatology guideline provides 12 ungraded good practice statements and 131 graded recommendations for reproductive health care in RMD patients. These recommendations are intended to guide care for all patients with RMD , except where indicated as being specific for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, those positive for antiphospholipid antibody, and/or those positive for anti‐Ro/ SSA and/or anti‐La/ SSB antibodies. Recommendations and good practice statements support several guiding principles: use of safe and effective contraception to prevent unplanned pregnancy, pre‐pregnancy counseling to encourage conception during periods of disease quiescence and while receiving pregnancy‐compatible medications, and ongoing physician‐patient discussion with obstetrics/gynecology collaboration for all reproductive health issues, given the overall low level of available evidence that relates specifically to RMD . Conclusion This guideline provides evidence‐based recommendations developed and reviewed by panels of experts and RMD patients. Many recommendations are conditional, reflecting a lack of data or low‐level data. We intend that this guideline be used to inform a shared decision‐making process between patients and their physicians on issues related to reproductive health that incorporates patients’ values, preferences, and comorbidities.","[""Lisa R.

<i>De novo</i> assembly of the cattle reference genome with single-molecule sequencing,"Major advances in selection progress for cattle have been made following the introduction of genomic tools over the past 10-12 years. These tools depend upon the Bos taurus reference genome (UMD3.1.1), which was created using now-outdated technologies and is hindered by a variety of deficiencies and inaccuracies. We present the new reference genome for cattle, ARS-UCD1.2, based on the same animal as the original to facilitate transfer and interpretation of results obtained from the earlier version, but applying a combination of modern technologies in a de novo assembly to increase continuity, accuracy, and completeness. The assembly includes 2.7 Gb and is >250× more continuous than the original assembly, with contig N50 >25 Mb and L50 of 32. We also greatly expanded supporting RNA-based data for annotation that identifies 30,396 total genes (21,039 protein coding). The new reference assembly is accessible in annotated form for public use. We demonstrate that improved continuity of assembled sequence warrants the adoption of ARS-UCD1.2 as the new cattle reference genome and that increased assembly accuracy will benefit future research on this species.","[""Benjamin D.

Evaluation of the BNT162b2 Covid-19 Vaccine in Children 5 to 11 Years of Age,"BackgroundSafe, effective vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) are urgently needed in children younger than 12 years of age.MethodsA phase 1, dose-finding study and an ongoing phase 2–3 randomized trial are being conducted to investigate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine administered 21 days apart in children 6 months to 11 years of age. We present results for 5-to-11-year-old children. In the phase 2–3 trial, participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive two doses of either the BNT162b2 vaccine at the dose level identified during the open-label phase 1 study or placebo. Immune responses 1 month after the second dose of BNT162b2 were immunologically bridged to those in 16-to-25-year-olds from the pivotal trial of two 30-μg doses of BNT162b2. Vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 at 7 days or more after the second dose was assessed.Download a PDF of the Research Summary.ResultsDuring the phase 1 study, a total of 48 children 5 to 11 years of age received 10 μg, 20 μg, or 30 μg of the BNT162b2 vaccine (16 children at each dose level). On the basis of reactogenicity and immunogenicity, a dose level of 10 μg was selected for further study. In the phase 2–3 trial, a total of 2268 children were randomly assigned to receive the BNT162b2 vaccine (1517 children) or placebo (751 children). At data cutoff, the median follow-up was 2.3 months. In the 5-to-11-year-olds, as in other age groups, the BNT162b2 vaccine had a favorable safety profile. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were noted. One month after the second dose, the geometric mean ratio of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing titers in 5-to-11-year-olds to those in 16-to-25-year-olds was 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93 to 1.18), a ratio meeting the prespecified immunogenicity success criterion (lower bound of two-sided 95% CI, >0.67; geometric mean ratio point estimate, ≥0.8). Covid-19 with onset 7 days or more after the second dose was reported in three recipients of the BNT162b2 vaccine and in 16 placebo recipients (vaccine efficacy, 90.7%; 95% CI, 67.7 to 98.3).ConclusionsA Covid-19 vaccination regimen consisting of two 10-μg doses of BNT162b2 administered 21 days apart was found to be safe, immunogenic, and efficacious in children 5 to 11 years of age.

The impact of sex on gene expression across human tissues,"Many complex human phenotypes exhibit sex-differentiated characteristics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain largely unknown. We generated a catalog of sex differences in gene expression and in the genetic regulation of gene expression across 44 human tissue sources surveyed by the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx, v8 release). We demonstrate that sex influences gene expression levels and cellular composition of tissue samples across the human body. A total of 37% of all genes exhibit sex-biased expression in at least one tissue. We identify cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with sex-differentiated effects and characterize their cellular origin. By integrating sex-biased eQTLs with genome-wide association study data, we identify 58 gene-trait associations that are driven by genetic regulation of gene expression in a single sex. These findings provide an extensive characterization of sex differences in the human transcriptome and its genetic regulation.","[""Meritxell Oliva"", ""Manuel Mu\u00f1oz-Aguirre"", ""Sarah Kim-Hellmuth"", ""Valentin Wucher"", ""Ariel DH Gewirtz"", ""Daniel J.

Automated assembly scaffolding using RagTag elevates a new tomato system for high-throughput genome editing,"Advancing crop genomics requires efficient genetic systems enabled by high-quality personalized genome assemblies. Here, we introduce RagTag, a toolset for automating assembly scaffolding and patching, and we establish chromosome-scale reference genomes for the widely used tomato genotype M82 along with Sweet-100, a new rapid-cycling genotype that we developed to accelerate functional genomics and genome editing in tomato. This work outlines strategies to rapidly expand genetic systems and genomic resources in other plant species.","[""Michael Alonge"", ""Ludivine Lebeigle"", ""Melanie Kirsche"", ""Katie Jenike"", ""Shujun Ou"", ""Sergey Aganezov"", ""Xingang Wang"", ""Zachary B.

"Extended-spectrum <b>β</b>-lactamases: an update on their characteristics, epidemiology and detection","Abstract Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative pathogens are a major cause of resistance to expanded-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics. Since their discovery in the early 1980s, they have spread worldwide and an are now endemic in Enterobacterales isolated from both hospital-associated and community-acquired infections. As a result, they are a global public health concern. In the past, TEM- and SHV-type ESBLs were the predominant families of ESBLs. Today CTX-M-type enzymes are the most commonly found ESBL type with the CTX-M-15 variant dominating worldwide, followed in prevalence by CTX-M-14, and CTX-M-27 is emerging in certain parts of the world. The genes encoding ESBLs are often found on plasmids and harboured within transposons or insertion sequences, which has enabled their spread. In addition, the population of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli is dominated globally by a highly virulent and successful clone belonging to ST131. Today, there are many diagnostic tools available to the clinical microbiology laboratory and include both phenotypic and genotypic tests to detect β-lactamases. Unfortunately, when ESBLs are not identified in a timely manner, appropriate antimicrobial therapy is frequently delayed, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. Several analyses of clinical trials have shown mixed results with regards to whether a carbapenem must be used to treat serious infections caused by ESBLs or whether some of the older β-lactam-β-lactamase combinations such as piperacillin/tazobactam are appropriate. Some of the newer combinations such as ceftazidime/avibactam have demonstrated efficacy in patients. ESBL-producing Gram-negative pathogens will continue to be major contributor to antimicrobial resistance worldwide. It is essential that we remain vigilant about identifying them both in patient isolates and through surveillance studies.","[""Mariana Castanheira"", ""Patricia J. Simner"", ""Patricia A.
