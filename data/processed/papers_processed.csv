W4385278813,review,journal,Materials and Manufacturing for Ankle–Foot Orthoses: A Review,"Ankle–foot orthoses (AFOs) assist patients with gait impairment by correcting ankle and foot deformities, restoring mobility, reducing pain, and providing protection and immobilization. AFOs can effectively manage various types of gait pathologies, including foot drop, crouch gait, equinus gait, and stiff knee gait. AFOs are available in prefabricated or custom‐made forms in various designs. The selection criteria for the fabrication of an AFO are the duration of usage, the amount of applied force, the degree of axial loading, the patient's skin condition, and the cost. The accessibility of diverse materials in the last century has significantly improved orthoses. Ideal orthotic materials must be light, stiff, and strong, and can be made of plastics, metals, polymer‐based composites, leather, or a hybrid of different materials. A deeper understanding of the materials employed in the fabrication of AFOs holds the potential for more advanced and efficient orthoses, which can improve patients’ ability to ambulate in the real world. The present review provides insight into the various materials utilized for the fabrication of AFOs and describes the benefits and challenges associated with the materials. An attempt has also been made to highlight typical gait pathologies and design concepts in response to them.",2023-07-26,2023,Alireza Nouri; Lijing Wang; Yuncang Li; Cuié Wen,RMIT University,Advanced Engineering Materials,16,https://doi.org/10.1002/adem.202300238,Advanced_Manufacturing,Foot drop; Gait; Ankle; Foot (prosody); Fabrication,1.0,0.358,1,0.887242724929672
W4388185981,article,journal,Securing <scp>AI</scp>‐based healthcare systems using blockchain technology: A state‐of‐the‐art systematic literature review and future research directions,"Abstract Healthcare institutions are progressively integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into their operations. The extraordinary potential of AI is restricted by insufficient medical data for AI model training and adversarial attacks wherein attackers perturb the dataset by adding some noise to it, which leads to the malfunctioning of the AI models, and a lack of trust caused by the opaque operational approach it employs. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a state‐of‐the‐art survey of the research on blockchain technology for securing AI‐integrated healthcare applications. The most relevant articles from the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases were identified using the PRISMA model. Most of the existing literature is about protecting the healthcare data used by AI‐based healthcare systems using blockchain technology, but the modality of data (text, images, audio, and sound) was not specifically mentioned. Information on protecting the training phase and model deployment for AI‐based healthcare systems considering the variations in feature extraction based on the modality of data was also not clearly specified. Hence, the three subfields of AI, namely, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and acoustic AI are further studied to identify security loopholes in its implementation pipeline. The three phases, namely the dataset, the training phase, and the trained models need to be protected from adversaries to avoid malfunctioning of the deployed AI models. The nature of the data processed by NLP, computer vision, and acoustic AI, underlying deep neural network (DNN) architectures, the complexity of attacks, and the perceivability of attacks by humans are analyzed to identify the need for security. A blockchain solution for AI‐based healthcare systems is synthesized based on the findings that have demonstrated the distinctive technological features of blockchains. It offers a solution for the privacy and security issues encountered by NLP, computer vision, and acoustic AI to boost the widespread adoption of AI applications in healthcare.",2023-10-27,2023,Rucha Shinde; Shruti Patil; Ketan Kotecha; Vidyasagar Potdar; Ganeshsree Selvachandran,Curtin University,Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies,46,https://doi.org/10.1002/ett.4884,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Health care; Software deployment; Deep learning,1.0,0.85,1,0.9265793220878924
W4362625221,article,journal,Editorial for special issue on security and trust on networked systems,"The world is becoming increasingly connected, from Internet of Things (IoT) and social networks to big data and cloud computing. Networked systems are not just relevant to information technology but have been already integrated with the engineering and cyber-physical systems domains. The agents of networked systems (e.g., sensor networks) can sense, compute, and interact based on a given task. However, networked systems suffer from many security and trust issues, as these systems are mostly designed based on traditional IT infrastructure. For example, attackers can compromise one internal sensor nodes and infect other nodes afterwards. There was an increase in malware attacks on IoT/Connected Devices of 77% in the first half of 2022, according to a recent report by Sonic Wall. This special issue focuses on how to build a trust and secure networked systems, and identifies new issues and directions for future research and development work. In the first contribution entitled “Privacy-preserving and efficient user matching based on attribute encryption in mobile social networks,” Wu et al. aimed to protect users' privacy and introduced an attribute-based encryption scheme based on the defined policy. Then the server does not need to decrypt the attribute matching file frequently for dating users. The proposed scheme can provide several benefits: (1) it allows two-way matching to support suitable publishers recommended to requesters with dating interests, (2) our scheme protects the privacy of users by encrypting the tagged keywords of the interest information collected from requesters and the personal attribute information of publishers, and (3) the scheme can reduce the computational cost by transferring most of the decryption work to the matching server and dividing the encryption into preparation and online stages. In the second contribution entitled “Privacy Preserving distributed smart grid system based on Hyperledger Fabric and Wireguard,” Yao et al. focused on the security issues of Smart Grid and designed a secure and decentralized energy trading platform in edge area of smart grid system by means of Hyperledger Fabric and WireGuard VPN. WireGuard can customize network gateway and controls traffic by WireGuard Interface, which includes an exclusive private key generated by the elliptic curve, a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) listening port, and a group of peer nodes. The proposed architecture was composed of four main layers, including application, blockchain platform, network structure, and physical infrastructure. In the experiment, the authors tested the bandwidth in WireGuard network and transactions throughput capacity of HyperLedger Fabric blockchain. It showed the feasibility of the proposed architecture, even with the WireGuard communication latency. In the third contribution entitled “Intelligent detection of vulnerable functions in software through neural embedding-based code analysis,” Zeng et al. found that convolutional neural network (CNN) is only suitable for extracting local features but not effective for extracting long-distance dependent features. This work proposed a function-level vulnerability detection framework based on CodeBERT, by adding two fully connected layers and fine-tuning techniques. That is, during fine-tuning, the authors added artificially synthesized data to deepen the network depth. To enhance the ability of capturing bigger contextual dependencies of sequence, the authors used BERT and utilized the bidirectional structure of Transformer. The authors also utilized the synthetic C test samples for fine-tuning the proposed framework. Experimental results indicated that the fine-tuned model can effectively improve the detection performance and outperform several baseline systems. In the fourth contribution entitled “MACPABE: Multi Authority-Based CP-ABE with Efficient Attribute Revocation for IoT-Enabled Healthcare Infrastructure,” Das et al. aimed to solve key escrow problems and introduced a fine-grained access control scheme to support efficient attribute revocation. The proposed scheme is based on less expensive elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) operations, which can resist collision attacks. The multiple authorities are responsible for generating keys related to the attributes of the user. Post-collection of data from IoT devices and the data owner (DO) encrypts the data and defines an access policy for the authorized users. Then, the DO uploads these data to the cloud server. The cloud service provider then re-encrypts this encrypted data and stores it in its database. To reduce the decryption overhead of end-users, the decryption process is outsourced to a decryption assistant (DA). In the fifth contribution entitled “A federated semi-supervised learning approach for network traffic classification,” Jin et al. identified that most of the collected traffic data is unlabeled, and it is very labor-intensive and expensive to label data. For this issue, the authors proposed an approach using federated semi-supervised learning (SSL) to conduct the network traffic classification task. It allows multiple parties to jointly train a traffic classification model without disclosing and sharing their local user data. This not only resolves the problem of exposing user data but also solves the problem of data islands in the traffic field. The authors then tested different classification models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for reaching SSL in the federated learning environment. These models can combine unsupervised learning with supervised learning, in order to use a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount of labeled data simultaneously to train a global model. In the evaluation, the authors showed that the proposed approach is more practical than the existing centralized deep learning methods. On the whole, the special issue papers cover a broad range of research on security, privacy and trust on networked systems, for example, IoT, and discuss many potential security threats and promising solutions.

W4297087469,review,journal,Recent Development of Moisture‐Enabled‐Electric Nanogenerators,"Power generation by converting energy from the ambient environment has been considered a promising strategy for developing decentralized electrification systems to complement the electricity supply for daily use. Wet gases, such as water evaporation or moisture in the atmosphere, can be utilized as a tremendous source of electricity by emerging power generation devices, that is, moisture-enabled-electric nanogenerators (MEENGs). As a promising technology, MEENGs provided a novel manner to generate electricity by harvesting energy from moisture, originating from the interactions between water molecules and hydrophilic functional groups. Though the remarkable progress of MEENGs has been achieved, a systematic review in this specific area is urgently needed to summarize previous works and provide sharp points to further develop low-cost and high-performing MEENGs through overcoming current limitations. Herein, the working mechanisms of MEENGs reported so far are comprehensively compared. Subsequently, a systematic summary of the materials selection and fabrication methods for currently reported MEENG construction is presented. Then, the improvement strategies and development directions of MEENG are provided. At last, the demonstrations of the applications assembled with MEENGs are extracted. This work aims to pave the way for the further MEENGs to break through the performance limitations and promote the popularization of future micron electronic self-powered equipment.",2022-09-22,2022,Peiyuan Guan; Renbo Zhu; Guangyu Hu; Robert Patterson; Fandi Chen,University of New South Wales,Small,74,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202204603,Energy_Sustainability,Materials science; Moisture; Nanotechnology; Engineering physics; Composite material,1.0,0.45,0,1.0
W4315498031,article,journal,Multi‐aspects <scp>AI</scp>‐based modeling and adversarial learning for cybersecurity intelligence and robustness: A comprehensive overview,"Abstract Due to the rising dependency on digital technology, cybersecurity has emerged as a more prominent field of research and application that typically focuses on securing devices, networks, systems, data and other resources from various cyber‐attacks, threats, risks, damages, or unauthorized access. Artificial intelligence (AI), also referred to as a crucial technology of the current Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0 or 4IR), could be the key to intelligently dealing with these cyber issues. Various forms of AI methodologies, such as analytical, functional, interactive, textual as well as visual AI can be employed to get the desired cyber solutions according to their computational capabilities. However, the dynamic nature and complexity of real‐world situations and data gathered from various cyber sources make it challenging nowadays to build an effective AI‐based security model. Moreover, defending robustly against adversarial attacks is still an open question in the area. In this article, we provide a comprehensive view on “Cybersecurity Intelligence and Robustness,” emphasizing multi‐aspects AI‐based modeling and adversarial learning that could lead to addressing diverse issues in various cyber applications areas such as detecting malware or intrusions, zero‐day attacks, phishing, data breach, cyberbullying and other cybercrimes. Thus the eventual security modeling process could be automated, intelligent, and robust compared to traditional security systems. We also emphasize and draw attention to the future aspects of cybersecurity intelligence and robustness along with the research direction within the context of our study. Overall, our goal is not only to explore AI‐based modeling and pertinent methodologies but also to focus on the resulting model's applicability for securing our digital systems and society.",2023-01-10,2023,Iqbal H.

W4387184750,article,journal,Analysing Industry 4.0 technology-solution dependencies: a support framework for successful Industry 4.0 adoption in the product generation process,"Abstract Industry 4.0 (i4.0) is central to advanced manufacturing. Building on novel digital technologies, it enables smart and flexible manufacturing with systems connected across company boundaries and product lifecycle phases. Despite its benefits, the adoption of i4.0 has been limited, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises. A key challenge is the technological complexity of i4.0. While advanced functionality requires technological complexity, it complicates an understanding of which enabling technologies are particularly useful and required. This article presents a framework to support successful i4.0 adoption across the entire product generation process through a systematic matrix-based dependency analysis of i4.0 solutions and underlying i4.0 technologies. Through increasing transparency around technological complexity of i4.0 solutions, this research contributes to a better understanding of which technologies are required for specific i4.0 solutions and which technologies could be strategic enablers for a broad variety of i4.0 applications. Knowing these technological dependencies supports both, the systematic adoption of existing i4.0 solutions and the development of new i4.0 solutions. This also sets the basis for a future socio-technical investigation.",2023-09-29,2023,Matthias Guertler; David C.

W4391044499,review,journal,Artificial intelligence (AI)—it’s the end of the tox as we know it (and I feel fine)*,"The rapid progress of AI impacts diverse scientific disciplines, including toxicology, and has the potential to transform chemical safety evaluation. Toxicology has evolved from an empirical science focused on observing apical outcomes of chemical exposure, to a data-rich field ripe for AI integration. The volume, variety and velocity of toxicological data from legacy studies, literature, high-throughput assays, sensor technologies and omics approaches create opportunities but also complexities that AI can help address. In particular, machine learning is well suited to handle and integrate large, heterogeneous datasets that are both structured and unstructured-a key challenge in modern toxicology. AI methods like deep neural networks, large language models, and natural language processing have successfully predicted toxicity endpoints, analyzed high-throughput data, extracted facts from literature, and generated synthetic data. Beyond automating data capture, analysis, and prediction, AI techniques show promise for accelerating quantitative risk assessment by providing probabilistic outputs to capture uncertainties. AI also enables explanation methods to unravel mechanisms and increase trust in modeled predictions. However, issues like model interpretability, data biases, and transparency currently limit regulatory endorsement of AI. Multidisciplinary collaboration is needed to ensure development of interpretable, robust, and human-centered AI systems. Rather than just automating human tasks at scale, transformative AI can catalyze innovation in how evidence is gathered, data are generated, hypotheses are formed and tested, and tasks are performed to usher new paradigms in chemical safety assessment. Used judiciously, AI has immense potential to advance toxicology into a more predictive, mechanism-based, and evidence-integrated scientific discipline to better safeguard human and environmental wellbeing across diverse populations.",2024-01-20,2024,Nicole Kleinstreuer; Thomas Härtung,University of Melbourne,Archives of Toxicology,58,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-023-03666-2,AI_Machine_Learning,Computer science; Psychology; Internet privacy; Artificial intelligence,1.0,0.85,1,1.0
W4366091323,article,journal,"Deep learning modelling techniques: current progress, applications, advantages, and challenges","Abstract Deep learning (DL) is revolutionizing evidence-based decision-making techniques that can be applied across various sectors. Specifically, it possesses the ability to utilize two or more levels of non-linear feature transformation of the given data via representation learning in order to overcome limitations posed by large datasets. As a multidisciplinary field that is still in its nascent phase, articles that survey DL architectures encompassing the full scope of the field are rather limited. Thus, this paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-art DL modelling techniques and provides insights into their advantages and challenges. It was found that many of the models exhibit a highly domain-specific efficiency and could be trained by two or more methods. However, training DL models can be very time-consuming, expensive, and requires huge samples for better accuracy. Since DL is also susceptible to deception and misclassification and tends to get stuck on local minima, improved optimization of parameters is required to create more robust models. Regardless, DL has already been leading to groundbreaking results in the healthcare, education, security, commercial, industrial, as well as government sectors. Some models, like the convolutional neural network (CNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN), recurrent neural network (RNN), recursive neural networks, and autoencoders, are frequently used, while the potential of other models remains widely unexplored. Pertinently, hybrid conventional DL architectures have the capacity to overcome the challenges experienced by conventional models. Considering that capsule architectures may dominate future DL models, this work aimed to compile information for stakeholders involved in the development and use of DL models in the contemporary world.",2023-04-17,2023,Shams Forruque Ahmed; Md.

W4386529406,review,journal,A comprehensive review of machine learning algorithms and their application in geriatric medicine: present and future,"Abstract The increasing access to health data worldwide is driving a resurgence in machine learning research, including data-hungry deep learning algorithms. More computationally efficient algorithms now offer unique opportunities to enhance diagnosis, risk stratification, and individualised approaches to patient management. Such opportunities are particularly relevant for the management of older patients, a group that is characterised by complex multimorbidity patterns and significant interindividual variability in homeostatic capacity, organ function, and response to treatment. Clinical tools that utilise machine learning algorithms to determine the optimal choice of treatment are slowly gaining the necessary approval from governing bodies and being implemented into healthcare, with significant implications for virtually all medical disciplines during the next phase of digital medicine. Beyond obtaining regulatory approval, a crucial element in implementing these tools is the trust and support of the people that use them. In this context, an increased understanding by clinicians of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms provides an appreciation of the possible benefits, risks, and uncertainties, and improves the chances for successful adoption. This review provides a broad taxonomy of machine learning algorithms, followed by a more detailed description of each algorithm class, their purpose and capabilities, and examples of their applications, particularly in geriatric medicine.

W3109965900,review,journal,A review on lithium recovery using electrochemical capturing systems,"Resource recovery from natural reserves is appealing and Li extraction from different brines is in the forefront. Li extraction by membranes is reviewed in the literature much more than electrochemical processes. However, a very recent review thoroughly discussed Li recovery by electrochemically switchable ion exchange (ESIX). This paper reviews Li recovery by both charge transfer processes, namely electrodialysis (ED), and electro-sorption processes, namely capacitive deionization (CDI). It also reviews ESIX with a focus on performance matrices and includes comments on the technology readiness of each separation technique. These processes exhibit promising perspectives on the separation and recovery of Li both selectively and non-selectively from simulated brine solutions and Li salt solutions. Readers are provided with guidelines to choose between the processes, depending on the applied voltage, current density, specific energy consumption and purity of recovered Li. Most electrochemical lithium capturing systems (ELiCSs) have been tested at the lab scale. Therefore, future research should be directed toward pilot-scale development and parameter optimization. Furthermore, we urge the ELiCSs research community to report information in a standard form that allows meaningful comparisons and insights into the systems.",2020-12-04,2020,Sifani Zavahir; Tasneem Elmakki; Mona Gulied; Zubair Ahmad; Leena Al‐Sulaiti,University of Sydney,Desalination,184,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2020.114883,Energy_Sustainability,Capacitive deionization; Electrodialysis; Desalination; Process engineering; Brine,1.0,0.45,0,0.8470658345570985
W4287958173,article,journal,Role of optimization techniques in microgrid energy management systems—A review,"Expeditious urbanization, population growth, and technological advancements in the past decade have significantly impacted the rise of energy demand across the world. Mitigation of environmental impacts and socio-economic benefits associated with the renewable energy systems advocate the higher integration of the distributed energy systems into the conventional electricity grids. However, the rise of renewable energy generation increases the intermittent and stochastic nature of the energy management problem significantly. Therefore, an optimal energy management technique is required to achieve a high level of system reliability and operational efficiency. A state-of-the-art systematic review of the different optimization techniques used to address the energy management problems in microgrids is presented in this article. The different optimization techniques used in energy management problems, particularly focusing on forecasting, demand management, economic dispatch, and unit commitment, are identified and critically analyzed in this review. The inferences from the review indicated that the mixed integer programming techniques were widely used, considering their simplicity and performance in solving the energy management problem in microgrids. The multi-agent-based techniques and meta-heuristics algorithms outperformed the other conventional techniques in terms of the efficiency of the system due to the decentralized nature of the EMS problem in microgrids and the capability of these techniques to act effectively in such scenarios. In addition, it was also evident that the use of advanced optimization techniques was limited in the scope of forecasting and demand management. Advocating the need for more accurate scheduling and forecasting algorithms to address the energy management problem in microgrids. Finally, the need for an end-to-end energy management solution for a microgrid system and a transactive/collaborative energy sharing functionality in a community microgrid is presented.",2022-07-26,2022,Gokul Sidarth Thirunavukkarasu; Mehdi Seyedmahmoudian; Elmira Jamei; Ben Horan; Saad Mekhilef,Deakin University,Energy Strategy Reviews,231,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esr.2022.100899,Energy_Sustainability,Energy management; Microgrid; Computer science; Renewable energy; Energy management system,1.0,0.925,0,0.953304376629588

W4390770894,review,journal,"A review on microgrid optimization with meta-heuristic techniques: Scopes, trends and recommendation","Microgrids (MGs) use renewable sources to meet the growing demand for energy with increasing consumer needs and technological advancement. They operate independently as small-scale energy networks using distributed energy resources. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources and poor power quality are essential operational problems that must be mitigated to improve the MG's performance. To address these challenges, researchers have introduced heuristic optimization mechanisms for MGs. However, local minima and the inability to find a global minimum in heuristic methods create errors in non-linear and nonconvex optimization, posing challenges in dealing with several operational aspects of MG such as energy management optimization, cost-effective dispatch, dependability, storage sizing, cyber-attack minimization, and grid integration. These challenges affect MG's performance by adding complexity to the management of storage capacity, cost minimization, reliability assurance, and balance of renewable sources, which accelerates the need for meta-heuristic optimization algorithms (MHOAs). This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of MHOAs and their role in improving the operational performance of MGs. Firstly, the fundamentals of MG optimization are discussed to explore the scopes, requisites, and opportunities of MHOAs in MG networks. Secondly, several MHOAs in the MG domain are described, and their recent trends in MG's techno-economic analysis, load forecasting, resiliency improvement, control operation, fault diagnosis, and energy management are summarized. The summary reveals that nearly 25% of the research in these areas utilizes the particle swarm optimization method, while the genetic and grey wolf algorithms are utilized by nearly 10% and 5% of the works studied in this paper, respectively, for optimizing the MG's performance. This result summarizes that MHOA presents a system-agnostic optimization approach, offering a new avenue for enhancing the effectiveness of future MGs. Finally, we highlight some challenges that emerge during the integration of MHOAs into MGs, potentially motivating researchers to conduct further studies in this area.",2024-01-01,2024,Afifa Akter; Ehsanul Islam Zafir; Nazia Hasan Dana; Rahul Joysoyal; Subrata K.

Virtual environments and immersive games (such as, Second Life, Fortnite, Roblox and VRChat) have been described as antecedents of the metaverse and offer some insight to the potential socio-economic impact of a fully functional persistent cross platform metaverse. Separating the hype and ""meta…"" rebranding from current reality is difficult, as ""big tech"" paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people.

W4362695433,review,journal,Planning and protection of DC microgrid: A critical review on recent developments,"Nowadays, direct current (DC) microgrid is gaining importance due to the wide utilization of DC loads, integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage devices, and no frequency and reactive power control issues. However, planning and protection of such microgrid are complicated due to the connection of several distributed generators (DGs), loads, utility grids, and energy storage systems (ESSs) to the DC bus with power electronic converters. Hitherto, the protection of DC microgrid has not drawn sufficient attention due to the high cost and immature protective devices for DC faults. Furthermore, the reliability of DC microgrid highly depends on proper planning, protection, and power-sharing among the DGs, ESSs, and utility grids. Thus, this article provides a critical summary of two main aspects of DC microgrids, such as protection and planning. Since the mentioned aspects are mutually dependent, a discussion of an aggregated point of view is included. The advantages and disadvantages of different protection and planning approaches are well documented. The possible improvements of existing protection and planning methods are outlined. The key research areas are identified, and future research directions are mentioned so that cutting-edge technologies can be adopted, making the review article unique compared to the existing reviews.

W4386593573,article,journal,Developing a trusted human-AI network for humanitarian benefit,"Abstract Artificial intelligences (AI) will increasingly participate digitally and physically in conflicts yet there is a lack of trusted communications with humans for humanitarian purposes. For example, in disasters and conflicts messaging and social media are used to share information, however, international humanitarian relief organisations treat this information as unverifiable and untrustworthy. Furthermore, current AI implementations can be brittle, with a narrow scope of application and wide scope of ethical risks. Meanwhile, human error can cause significant civilian harms even by combatants committed to compliance with international humanitarian law. AI offers an opportunity to help reduce the tragedy of war and better deliver humanitarian aid to those who need it. However, to be successful, these systems must be trusted by humans and their information systems, overcoming flawed information flows in conflict and disaster zones that continue to be marked by intermittent communications, poor situation awareness, mistrust and human errors. In this paper, we consider the integration of a communications protocol (the ‘Whiteflag protocol’), distributed ledger ‘blockchain’ technology, and information fusion with artificial intelligence (AI), to improve conflict communications called “Protected Assurance Understanding Situation &amp; Entities” (PAUSE). Such a trusted human-AI communication network could provide accountable information exchange regarding protected entities, critical infrastructure, humanitarian signals and status updates for humans and machines in conflicts. Trust-based information fusion provides resource-efficient use of diverse data sources to increase the reliability of reports. AI can catch human mistakes and complement human decision making, while human judgment can direct and override AI recommendations. We examine several realistic potential case studies for the integration of these technologies into a trusted human-AI network for humanitarian benefit including mapping a conflict zone with civilians and combatants in real time, preparation to avoid incidents and using the network to manage misinformation.

Actors are not incentivised to consider any aspects of sustainability. While environmental concerns are acknowledged, they are often viewed as technical challenges to overcome by individual companies, rather than global systemic issues that require a collaborative approach.

W3034837531,article,journal,The 2020 photovoltaic technologies roadmap,"Abstract Over the past decade, the global cumulative installed photovoltaic (PV) capacity has grown exponentially, reaching 591 GW in 2019. Rapid progress was driven in large part by improvements in solar cell and module efficiencies, reduction in manufacturing costs and the realization of levelized costs of electricity that are now generally less than other energy sources and approaching similar costs with storage included. Given this success, it is a particularly fitting time to assess the state of the photovoltaics field and the technology milestones that must be achieved to maximize future impact and forward momentum.

W4387933272,article,journal,Soft matter roadmap<sup>*</sup>,"Abstract Soft materials are usually defined as materials made of mesoscopic entities, often self-organised, sensitive to thermal fluctuations and to weak perturbations. Archetypal examples are colloids, polymers, amphiphiles, liquid crystals, foams. The importance of soft materials in everyday commodity products, as well as in technological applications, is enormous, and controlling or improving their properties is the focus of many efforts. From a fundamental perspective, the possibility of manipulating soft material properties, by tuning interactions between constituents and by applying external perturbations, gives rise to an almost unlimited variety in physical properties. Together with the relative ease to observe and characterise them, this renders soft matter systems powerful model systems to investigate statistical physics phenomena, many of them relevant as well to hard condensed matter systems. Understanding the emerging properties from mesoscale constituents still poses enormous challenges, which have stimulated a wealth of new experimental approaches, including the synthesis of new systems with, e.g. tailored self-assembling properties, or novel experimental techniques in imaging, scattering or rheology. Theoretical and numerical methods, and coarse-grained models, have become central to predict physical properties of soft materials, while computational approaches that also use machine learning tools are playing a progressively major role in many investigations. This Roadmap intends to give a broad overview of recent and possible future activities in the field of soft materials, with experts covering various developments and challenges in material synthesis and characterisation, instrumental, simulation and theoretical methods as well as general concepts.",2023-10-25,2023,Jean‐Louis Barrat; Emanuela Del Gado; Stefan U.

Even though the phasing out of hydrocarbons as an energy source is inevitable, the demise of the hydrocarbon industry is not. This study, demonstrates that the hydrocarbon industry can make a significant contribution as the world transitions to low carbon energy. in this paper, we discuss the role of the hydrocarbon industry in developing a new hydrogen industry, demonstrating how the industry’s know how will be vital in the development, construction, and delivery of both blue and green hydrogen to an energy hungry world.",2023-06-01,2023,Tina Hunter; Jordie Pettit; Madeline Taylor,Macquarie University,The Journal of World Energy Law & Business,2,https://doi.org/10.1093/jwelb/jwad007,Energy_Sustainability,Hydrocarbon; Petroleum industry; Demise; Natural resource economics; Fossil fuel,0.8,0.625,0,0.9927910029096546

What is new and distinctive about East Asia’s approach to the green energy transition? And what does this approach mean for the world? This book provides the first comprehensive account of East Asia’s green energy shift. Through an analysis of the ambitious national strategies of China and South Korea, the authors show how state actors have pursued a distinctively East Asian approach to transforming their energy systems, involving first the rapid creation of new green energy industries and then the coordinated destruction of fossil fuel incumbencies. This approach—described as ‘developmental environmentalism’—is aimed at establishing East Asian economies as leaders in the green industries of the future, while at the same time addressing the pressing environmental, social, and political problems associated with the carbon-intensive industries of the past. To execute their analysis, the authors synthesize insights from cutting-edge Developmental State and Schumpeterian theorizing. They show how state actors in East Asia are engaging in a sophisticated kind of economic statecraft, strategically harnessing the capitalist market dynamics of ‘creative-destruction’ to advance their transformative green ambitions through green growth. They also assess the implications of developmental environmentalism for developed and developing countries, and the future of the global green shift in an era of geostrategic rivalry.",2023-05-02,2023,Elizabeth Thurbon; Sung‐Young Kim; Hao Tan; John A.

W3109725889,review,journal,A Holistic Review of Cybersecurity and Reliability Perspectives in Smart Airports,"Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and aviation sector have resulted in the emergence of smart airports. Services and systems powered by the IoT enable smart airports to have enhanced robustness, efficiency and control, governed by real-time monitoring and analytics. Smart sensors control the environmental conditions inside the airport, automate passenger-related actions and support airport security. However, these augmentations and automation introduce security threats to network systems of smart airports. Cyber-attackers demonstrated the susceptibility of IoT systems and networks to Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), due to hardware constraints, software flaws or IoT misconfigurations. With the increasing complexity of attacks, it is imperative to safeguard IoT networks of smart airports and ensure reliability of services, as cyber-attacks can have tremendous consequences such as disrupting networks, cancelling travel, or stealing sensitive information. There is a need to adopt and develop new Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled cyber-defence techniques for smart airports, which will address the challenges brought about by the incorporation of IoT systems to the airport business processes, and the constantly evolving nature of contemporary cyber-attacks. In this study, we present a holistic review of existing smart airport applications and services enabled by IoT sensors and systems. Additionally, we investigate several types of cyber defence tools including AI and data mining techniques, and analyse their strengths and weaknesses in the context of smart airports.

W3100096660,article,journal,Attacks on Self-Driving Cars and Their Countermeasures: A Survey,"Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS) are currently evolving in the form of a cooperative ITS or connected vehicles. Both forms use the data communications between Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I/I2V) and other on-road entities, and are accelerating the adoption of self-driving cars. The development of cyber-physical systems containing advanced sensors, sub-systems, and smart driving assistance applications over the past decade is equipping unmanned aerial and road vehicles with autonomous decision-making capabilities. The level of autonomy depends upon the make-up and degree of sensor sophistication and the vehicle's operational applications. As a result, self-driving cars are being compromised perceived as a serious threat. Therefore, analyzing the threats and attacks on self-driving cars and ITSs, and their corresponding countermeasures to reduce those threats and attacks are needed. For this reason, some survey papers compiling potential attacks on VANETs, ITSs and self-driving cars, and their detection mechanisms are available in the current literature. However, up to our knowledge, they have not covered the real attacks already happened in self-driving cars. To bridge this research gap, in this paper, we analyze the attacks that already targeted self-driving cars and extensively present potential cyber-attacks and their impacts on those cars along with their vulnerabilities. For recently reported attacks, we describe the possible mitigation strategies taken by the manufacturers and governments. This survey includes recent works on how a self-driving car can ensure resilient operation even under ongoing cyber-attack.

W3108671495,article,journal,A Survey on Machine Learning Techniques for Cyber Security in the Last Decade,"Pervasive growth and usage of the Internet and mobile applications have expanded cyberspace. The cyberspace has become more vulnerable to automated and prolonged cyberattacks. Cyber security techniques provide enhancements in security measures to detect and react against cyberattacks. The previously used security systems are no longer sufficient because cybercriminals are smart enough to evade conventional security systems. Conventional security systems lack efficiency in detecting previously unseen and polymorphic security attacks. Machine learning (ML) techniques are playing a vital role in numerous applications of cyber security. However, despite the ongoing success, there are significant challenges in ensuring the trustworthiness of ML systems. There are incentivized malicious adversaries present in the cyberspace that are willing to game and exploit such ML vulnerabilities. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges that ML techniques face in protecting cyberspace against attacks, by presenting a literature on ML techniques for cyber security including intrusion detection, spam detection, and malware detection on computer networks and mobile networks in the last decade.

W3126295544,article,journal,A Polymorphic Advanced Encryption Standard – A Novel Approach,"To secure various forms of data, a polymorphic variant of the Advanced Encryption Standard (P-AES) has been introduced. In the P-AES, the AES parameters' values will change with every new key. The exact values will be available only to legitimate communicating parties during execution time. To achieve these objectives, the basic AES transformations, SubBytes, ShiftRows, and MixColumns, have been made key-dependent in the proposed P-AES. Hence, with every new key, these transformations will operate differently. The receiver can retrieve the operations' details from the encryption key. Consequently, polymorphism has been achieved and interoperability remains intact. P-AES has been implemented seamlessly using the existing AES modules, and the performance was more or less equal to the AES performance (71 and 70 milliseconds to encrypt 500 bytes using the P-AES and the AES respectively). From a security standpoint, the proposed P-AES fully complies with Kerckhoff's principle. This means the cipher has an open design, and the security provided by the P-AES depends only on the secrecy of the encryption key. The cipher resistance to differential and linear attacks has been proved. Moreover, the resulting proposed cipher can operate in 128 different ways, which will significantly reduce the capabilities of any sophisticated attacker. Furthermore, the proposed P-AES's scores of the key avalanche and the plaintext avalanche were 0.496 and 0.504 respectively. Finally, the Statistical Test Suite (STS) recommended by the NIST has been used to ensure the randomness of the cipher output, and the cipher has passed all the STS tests.",2021-01-01,2021,Abdelrahman Altigani; Shafaatunnur Hasan; Bazara I.

Chipendeke is a rural community in Zimbabwe, in which electricity demand is partially served by the only micro-hydro plant and hence, load shedding is a regular practice to keep essential services running. This study explored a suitable opportunity to identify a feasible system with different energy sources that can fulfill the current and projected future load demand of the community. A techno-economic feasibility study for a hybrid RE based power system (REPS) is examined considering various energy sources and cost functions. Six different system configurations have been designed with different sizing combinations to identify the most optimum solution for the locality considering techno-economic and environmental viability. The performance metrics considered to evaluate the best suitable model are; Net Present Cost (NPC), Cost of Energy (COE), Renewable Fraction (RF), excess energy and seasonal load variations. In-depth, sensitivity analyses have been performed to investigate the variations of the studied models with a little variation of input variables. Of the studied configurations, an off-grid hybrid Hydro/PV/DG/Battery system was found to be the most economically feasible compared to other configurations. This system had the lowest NPC and COE of $ \$ $ 307,657 and $ \$ $ 0.165/kWh respectively and the highest RF of 87.5%.

W4317795339,article,journal,On the Development of a Protection Profile Module for Encryption Key Management Components,"The ability of a cryptographic system to protect information from attacks depends on many factors, including the secrecy of the encryption key. A crucial aspect of any cryptosystem is how it manages the encryption keys. Encryption Key Management (EKM) spans the entire life cycle of the key, including the key's generation, usage, distribution, renewal, and destruction. Given the security sensitivity, it is desirable to adopt a widely accepted standard when developing an encryption key management system. Through rigorous development of security requirements and following standardized validation, evaluation, and certification, the consumers' confidence in the security of the EKM system will be enhanced. The Protection Profile (PP), defined in the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (often referred to as Common Criteria or CC), specifies the security functional and assurance requirements for a specific technology. In this work, we propose a PP Module that is the new evolution of the PP covering trusted security features for EKM, which is based on its compliance with the Network Device collaborative Protection Profile (NDcPP). In particular, by analyzing threats and vulnerabilities of EKM systems, corresponding security objectives and requirements are proposed in the PP, along with the specification of evaluation activities. The quantum-safe aspect of key distribution protocols is further investigated to support EKM products with quantum-resistant algorithms and quantum key distribution features.

Recent literature on CPS has extensively used game theory to approach a variety of technical challenges. In order to make these contributions more accessible to a broader audience, there is a need for studies that can provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of different types of CPS and their attributes, then clearly outline why game theory is relevant for modeling different aspects of CPS, and also discuss how game theory has been used in relevant literature to date. This paper bridges this gap by 1) providing a general discussion of different types of CPS and their characteristics; 2) giving an overview of different types of game-theoretic approaches; 3) explaining why game theory is appropriate for modeling different types of CPS; and 4) finally, studying how game theory has been used in different CPS types to address their challenges. Further, we also identify some key research challenges for future investigation where game theory could be applied as a potential solution.",2023-01-01,2023,Wayes Tushar; Chau Yuen; Tapan Kumar Saha; Mohammad Sohrab Hasan Nizami; Mollah Rezaul Alam,University of Queensland,IEEE Access,34,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2023.3239834,Digital_Transformation,Game theory; Computer science; Variety (cybernetics); Perspective (graphical); Management science,1.0,0.583,1,0.9710581901059782

W4379805168,article,journal,"Decentralized, Democratized, and Decarbonized Future Electric Power Distribution Grids: A Survey on the Paradigm Shift From the Conventional Power System to Micro Grid Structures","Micro-Grid (MG), a paradigm shift in conventional distribution power systems, facilitates the integration of many Renewable Energy Resources (RERs), storage units, and loads. The key catalyst behind this emerging paradigm is the increased attention to environment-energy sustainability nexus. This novel concept exhibits various attractive features such as sustainability, reliability, resilience, improved power quality, energy security, and liberalization of electric service industries. However, the integration of RER units and load participation into the MG brings various challenges to the stability and operation of the system. These challenges arise as a consequence of the intermittent nature of RERs due to their stochastic behavior and increased level of non-linearity associated with smart load participation. Furthermore, in recent years, the development and deployment of RER in MG networks have demonstrated exponential growth. Therefore, in order to achieve a holistic analysis, a comprehensive review study about various aspects of MG should be investigated. In this regard, this rigorous survey paper presents the meticulous study of various aspects, historical evolution, and key enabling yet transdisciplinary technologies of MG, such as various components, generation resources, load classification, communication infrastructure, energy management, control and optimization, operational modes, and various frameworks, configurations, architectures, and topologies-including the emerging concept of Networked MG with flexible boundaries. This study also reviewed various storage and protection systems in MG, considering the attention to their contributions to the stability of the system. This review also underscores many key issues, challenges, and factors related to the sustainable development of the MG system. Lastly, an all-inclusive cross-sectoral analysis that includes cyber-physical systems, power quality, information and data management, conversion systems, synthetic inertia, and some governance issues has been provided, along with the future directions, progression, and latest development in the field of MG.

W4388676703,article,journal,"Optimizing Technical and Economic Aspects of Off-Grid Hybrid Renewable Systems: A Case Study of Manoka Island, Cameroon","The lack of accessible and reliable electrical energy in Cameroon has become a pervasive obstacle to the nation's progress, with energy availability, quality, and cost identified as key hindrances to development over the past 15 years. Conventional solutions that rely on combustion engines and electrochemical storage systems have proven to be cost-prohibitive, limited in power output, and constrained in capacity. The dependence on traditional diesel generators has perpetuated maintenance challenges and a continuous demand for fuel supply, while the accompanying noise and pollution have restricted their use in residential areas. Recognizing the imperative of reducing dependence on fossil fuels and curbing greenhouse gas emissions, the need for clean and sustainable energy sources has emerged as a critical concern for the advancement of civilization. Against this backdrop, this research endeavors to identify the most cost-effective and efficient blend of renewable energy sources capable of meeting the power requirements of three small communities on Manoka Island, a district of Douala, Cameroon. Through a comprehensive technical, environmental, and economic analysis, this study addresses the substantial energy needs of 334 households, with an average daily power consumption of 1082.90 kWh and a peak electrical load of 183.99 kW. Leveraging the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) program, this investigation assesses the feasibility of implementing Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRES) to meet the region's energy demands. The research highlights the most optimal scenario integrating solar panels, wind turbines, battery cells, fuel cell generators, biogas, and an electrolyzer within an off-grid HRES system. Notably, the study demonstrated an absence of idle load, resulting in remarkably low unit energy costs of $0.1981 and a compelling net present value of $2,209,741. The cost-effective arrangement featured 201 batteries, yielding a project profit of $57,387, with an impressive Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 9.09%, Return on Investment (ROI) of 6.19%, and a payback period of 8.76 years over a 25-year term. In essence, the insights gleaned from this exploration of hybrid energy systems represent a pioneering case study in sustainable electricity provision. This research significantly contributes to the knowledge base on renewable energy within the nation, underscoring its tremendous potential for sustainable development and energy security.",2023-01-01,2023,Reagan Jean Jacques Molu; Serge Raoul Dzondé Naoussi; Patrice Wira; Wulfran Fendzi Mbasso; Saatong Tsobze Kenfack,Edith Cowan University,IEEE Access,15,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2023.3332693,Energy_Sustainability,Renewable energy; Environmental economics; Fossil fuel; Greenhouse gas; Diesel generator,1.0,0.925,0,0.9675754454906382

W4302780090,article,conference,Design and Flight Testing of a Rocket-Launched Folding UAV for Earth and Planetary Exploration Applications,"With the advances in Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles' (UAVs) control capabilities, advances in additive manufacturing technology, and miniaturization of components new opportunities have arisen for the application of UAVs to applications such as search and rescue, high-altitude surveying, and planetary exploration. UAVs can now be rapidly prototyped and manufactured to suit many applications. They have been proven to have the capability to survey large areas and perform complex scientific missions during flight. Recently, the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter performed a series of powered, controlled flights on another planet. Planetary exploration applications of UAVs pose challenges that are unique in comparison to terrestrial ones. Among these challenges are the deployment of UAVs, as well as the significant area required to be covered by a UAV conducting aerial surveying. Current applications rely on surface deployment of the UAV after successful landing of a primary payload, such as the Mars Perseverance rover. Deploying a UAV at altitude comes with the benefits of increased flight time and range associated with the mission profile being activated at an elevation above the planetary surface. Utilizing a morphological airframe results in a smaller pre-deployment footprint, which would allow for multiple UAVs to be packed into a single payload cannister and deployed progressively during descent. This paper presents the design and development of a low-cost, 3D printed, folding UAV for terrestrial and extra-planetary exploration applications using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. The flight systems are designed in such a way that the UAV can self-arm, re-orient if required, and acquire a stable hover pose before landing at a pre-determined GPS location. Other than employing GPS navigation for landing, the UAV will require no external input. The paper will also cover the design and development of a deployment system using a small high-power rocket to simulate atmospheric deployment of the UAV. Testing will aim to demonstrate the viability of deploying UAVs from a payload cannister during atmospheric injection. The project is unique in that it utilizes a novel method for deploying a UAV from a carrier vehicle while in ballistic descent, allowing for atmospheric insertion of multiple small-form-factor UAVs for planetary exploration purposes.",2022-03-05,2022,Samantha d'Arcy; Felipé Gonzalez,Queensland University of Technology,2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AERO),5,https://doi.org/10.1109/aero53065.2022.9843481,Space_Aerospace,Payload (computing); Software deployment; Mars Exploration Program; Aerospace engineering; Airframe,0.8,0.867,1,0.8349524578649922

IoT-related vulnerabilities, if successfully exploited can affect, not only the device itself but also the application field in which the IoT device operates. Evidently, identifying and addressing every single vulnerability are an arduous, if not impossible, task. Attack taxonomies can assist in classifying attacks and their corresponding vulnerabilities. Security countermeasures and best practices can then be leveraged to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities before they emerge into catastrophic attacks and ensure overall secure IoT operation. Therefore, in this article, we provide an attack taxonomy, which takes into consideration the different layers of the IoT stack, i.e., device, infrastructure, communication, and service, and each layer’s designated characteristics, which can be exploited by adversaries. Furthermore, using nine real-world cybersecurity incidents that had targeted IoT devices deployed in the consumer, commercial, and industrial sectors, we describe the IoT-related vulnerabilities, exploitation procedures, attacks, impacts, and potential mitigation mechanisms and protection strategies.

However, most of the works have focused on (semi-) supervised learning, resulting in shortcomings including heavy label reliance, poor generalization, and weak robustness. To address these issues, self-supervised learning (SSL), which extracts informative knowledge through well-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels, has become a promising and trending learning paradigm for graph data. Different from SSL on other domains like computer vision and natural language processing, SSL on graphs has an exclusive background, design ideas, and taxonomies. Under the umbrella of graph self-supervised learning, we present a timely and comprehensive review of the existing approaches which employ SSL techniques for graph data. We construct a unified framework that mathematically formalizes the paradigm of graph SSL. According to the objectives of pretext tasks, we divide these approaches into four categories: generation-based, auxiliary property-based, contrast-based, and hybrid approaches. We further describe the applications of graph SSL across various research fields and summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation benchmark, performance comparison and open-source codes of graph SSL.

W4327500290,article,,A Universal Deduplication Architecture for Secure and Efficient Cloud Storage,"Users now produce data at a rate that exceeds their ability to securely store and manage it all, provoking them to entrust their private files to Cloud Storage Providers (CSPs). These companies discreetly inspect users' files to undertake deduplication, which stores only a single instance of files that are redundant across their user base. By undertaking deduplication in this way, the CSP acquires low-cost storage at the expense of user privacy. This paper proposes universal deduplication, an alternative approach which shifts the advantage of deduplication from the CSP to the users, while ensuring semantic security of the users' transmitted data. Universal deduplication leverages indications of the trustworthiness of data availability on the Internet, paired with a format to automatically combine client-side deduplication and end-to-end encryption. By referencing data that is publicly available on the Internet, user files can be privately deduplicated without the need to transmit sensitive user data, while simultaneously reducing storage and encryption costs. An architecture for the implementation of universal deduplication is proposed in this paper, along with a preliminary investigation into the feasibility of the proposed concepts.",2022-12-01,2022,Kevin Saric; Gowri Ramachandran; Shantanu Pal; Raja Jurdak; ‪Surya Nepal‬,Queensland University of Technology,,5,https://doi.org/10.1109/tps-isa56441.2022.00012,Cybersecurity,Data deduplication; Computer science; Cloud computing; Encryption; Cloud storage,0.8,0.433,1,1.0

Unlike traditional systems facing widespread cyber-attacks, the sensitive nature of C3I tactical operations make their cybersecurity a critical concern. For instance, tampering or intercepting confidential information in military battlefields not only damages C3I operations, but also causes irreversible consequences such as loss of human lives and mission failures. Therefore, C3I systems have become a focal point for cyber adversaries. Moreover, technological advancements and modernization of C3I systems have significantly increased the potential risk of cyber-attacks on C3I systems. Consequently, cyber adversaries leverage highly sophisticated attack vectors to exploit security vulnerabilities in C3I systems. Despite the burgeoning significance of cybersecurity for C3I systems, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive review to systematize the body of knowledge on C3I systems' security. Therefore, in this paper, we have gathered, analyzed, and synthesized the state-of-the-art on the cybersecurity of C3I systems. In particular, this paper has identified security vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and countermeasures/defenses for C3I systems. Furthermore, our survey has enabled us to: (i) propose a taxonomy for security vulnerabilities, attack vectors and countermeasures; (ii) interrelate attack vectors with security vulnerabilities and countermeasures; and (iii) propose future research directions for advancing the state-of-the-art on the cybersecurity of C3I systems.",2022-08-17,2022,Hussain Ahmad; Isuru Dharmadasa; Faheem Ullah; Muhammad Ali Babar,University of Adelaide,ACM Computing Surveys,19,https://doi.org/10.1145/3558001,Cybersecurity,Computer security; Computer science; Battlefield; Situation awareness; Engineering,1.0,0.658,1,0.976148371743814
W4385568146,article,conference,TransformerLight: A Novel Sequence Modeling Based Traffic Signaling Mechanism via Gated Transformer,"Traffic signal control (TSC) is still one of the most significant and challenging research problems in the transportation field. Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved great success in TSC but suffers from critically high learning costs in practical applications due to the excessive trial-and-error learning process. Offline RL is a promising method to reduce learning costs whereas the data distribution shift issue is still up in the air. To this end, in this paper, we formulate TSC as a sequence modeling problem with a sequence of Markov decision process described by states, actions, and rewards from the traffic environment. A novel framework, namely TransformerLight, is introduced, which does not aim to fit into value functions by averaging all possible returns, but produces the best possible actions using a gated Transformer. Additionally, the learning process of TransformerLight is much more stable by replacing the residual connections with gated transformer blocks due to a dynamic system perspective. Through numerical experiments on offline datasets, we demonstrate that the TransformerLight model: (1) can build a high-performance adaptive TSC model without dynamic programming; (2) achieves a new state-of-the-art compared to most published offline RL methods so far; and (3) shows a more stable learning process than offline RL and recent Transformer-based methods.

This article aims to analyze EDL from the perspective of automated machine learning (AutoML). Specifically, we first illuminate EDL from DL and EC and regard EDL as an optimization problem. According to the DL pipeline, we systematically introduce EDL methods ranging from data preparation, model generation, to model deployment with a new taxonomy (i.e., what and how to evolve/optimize), and focus on the discussions of solution representation and search paradigm in handling the optimization problem by EC.

Here, standardization in IIoT relies on standards and technologies to make things communicative; data acquisition attempts to transparently collect data through plug-and-play architectures, reconfigurable schemes, or hardware expansion; data fusion refers to the techniques and strategies for overcoming heterogeneity in data formats and sources; and scalable architecture provides basic techniques to support heterogeneous requirements.

W4365504037,article,journal,"A survey on deep learning tools dealing with data scarcity: definitions, challenges, solutions, tips, and applications","Abstract Data scarcity is a major challenge when training deep learning (DL) models. DL demands a large amount of data to achieve exceptional performance. Unfortunately, many applications have small or inadequate data to train DL frameworks. Usually, manual labeling is needed to provide labeled data, which typically involves human annotators with a vast background of knowledge. This annotation process is costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. Usually, every DL framework is fed by a significant amount of labeled data to automatically learn representations. Ultimately, a larger amount of data would generate a better DL model and its performance is also application dependent. This issue is the main barrier for many applications dismissing the use of DL. Having sufficient data is the first step toward any successful and trustworthy DL application. This paper presents a holistic survey on state-of-the-art techniques to deal with training DL models to overcome three challenges including small, imbalanced datasets, and lack of generalization. This survey starts by listing the learning techniques. Next, the types of DL architectures are introduced. After that, state-of-the-art solutions to address the issue of lack of training data are listed, such as Transfer Learning (TL), Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Model Architecture (MA), Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), and Deep Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (DeepSMOTE). Then, these solutions were followed by some related tips about data acquisition needed prior to training purposes, as well as recommendations for ensuring the trustworthiness of the training dataset. The survey ends with a list of applications that suffer from data scarcity, several alternatives are proposed in order to generate more data in each application including Electromagnetic Imaging (EMI), Civil Structural Health Monitoring, Medical imaging, Meteorology, Wireless Communications, Fluid Mechanics, Microelectromechanical system, and Cybersecurity.

W4205914755,dissertation,,Ultrafast Spectroscopy for Printable Photovoltaics,"&lt;p&gt;The development of efficient and low cost photovoltaic technologies is key to a more sustainable energy pathway for future generations. Research efforts aimed at improving the performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials have resulted in a continuous growth in power conversion efficiency (PCE) over time, with a recent maximum PCE value of 18.22% in a single bulk heterojunction device. However, further improved efficiency, stability and cost reduction are required in order for OPVs to succeed in the market. To produce better performing OPV devices in a rational way, it is necessary to understand the relationships between material properties (e.g. energy levels, recombination rates, charge carrier mobilities) and the photovoltaic parameters. This requires combining different fundamental techniques, such as spectroscopic, electrical and structural studies of the materials. In this thesis work we contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of charge photo-current generation in OPV layers by using transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) to directly measure the fate of the photo-excited species created upon light absorption. In particular, we contribute to the understanding of the dynamical properties of tightly bound, interfacial charge-transfer (CT) states at the donor:acceptor heterojunction. We disentangle the contributions from individual transient species to the overall TAS signal via the soft-modelling algorithm known as Multivariate Curve Resolution by Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS), and we use simple kinetic models to retrieve associated kinetic rates. Our first study explores the photo-physics of a family of polymers derived from the low-band-gap alternating copolymer PTBT where the sulphur atom in the thiadiazole unit was substituted with oxygen or selenium. The literature shows that replacing a single atom in the donor or acceptor unit of a polymer donor can cause large changes in the photovoltaic parameters, which cannot be explained considering only the variations in the optical band-gap. Opposite results have been reported on systems where a sulfur atom is replaced by selenium, and spectroscopic studies were lacking. Our TAS results on PTBO and PTBSe systems explain the superior photovoltaic performance of the original sulfur-containing variant PTBT, highlighting the low tolerance of these materials to backbone substitutions. In both PTBO and PTBSe systems, we identify strong recombination of geminate CT pairs as the major limiting factor of the Jsc and FF photovoltaic parameters. This is attributed to unfavourable electronic and conformational properties at the donor:acceptor interface. In the particular case of PTBSe:PC61BM, the recombination pathway of CT states with triplet character into the triplet exciton manifold is facilitated by the heavy atom effect, in addition to a highly intermixed morphology. Our second study comprises the spectroscopic comparison between fullerene and nonfullerene (NFA) OPV layers. The PCE of OPV devices was reaching a plateau in past years, which was overcomed thanks to the development of high efficiency NFA acceptors. Here, we compare charge generation and recombination between three systems featuring the same polymer donor PPDT2FBT matched with three different acceptors, namely the fullerene acceptor PC70BM, the small molecule nonfullerene acceptor NIDCS-HO and the polymeric acceptor N2200. Our results provide insight on the processes that limit the performance of each device, showing that small molecule NFA are promising acceptors, since morphology and disorder, the factors that we have found to be limiting the device performance, could potentially be tuned for the development of more efficient materials. For the all-polymer device based on the N2200 acceptor, we find that both geminate and nongeminate recombination are limiting the photovoltaic performance. Lastly, we investigate charge carrier dynamics in a series of solar devices composed predominantly of C60 and small amounts of organic small molecule donors, where their CT state energies are systematically varied. The well-defined microstructure in low-donor-content OPV blends makes it easier to correlate macroscopic properties to molecular parameters. Our results, in combination with time-delayed collection field (TDCF), and external quantum efficiency measurements (EQE) measurements at different bias performed by our collaborators, allow us to identify geminate recombination as the major loss channel. We find that the dynamics of the CT decay are connected to the CT state energy via the energy-gap law. In this way, the energy of the CT state is identified as the main parameter determining the efficiency of photocurrent generation in these morphologically well-defined donor:acceptor blends. Overall, the contributions in this thesis work demonstrate how TAS measurements can provide valuable information to construct a comprehensive picture of the underpinning mechanisms of charge photo-current generation in OPV layers, in particular by isolating the dynamical properties of interfacial charge-transfer (CT) states at the donor:acceptor heterojunction via modelling.&lt;/p&gt;",2020-01-01,2020,Silvina N.

W4328052589,dissertation,,National Security Policy Options For Cyber Ecosystem Resilience,"&lt;p&gt;National cyber insecurity is a wicked problem that threatens states’ societies, economies, polities, and natural security. In a world of increasing digital dependence, it is essential that states are resilient to the threats targeting and originating from their use of cyberspace. This research uses the metaphor of an ecosystem to conceptualize states’ use of and influence over cyberspace, and identifies four key threats facing cyber ecosystems – critical infrastructure attacks, disinformation campaigns, financially motivated cybercrime and attempts to influence Internet governance. The concept of cyber ecosystem resilience is then defined, and a framework is outlined that can be used by states to identify and implement national security policies that enhance resilience against the identified cyber threats. The value of this framework is then demonstrated by applying it to the identification of a suite of policy options available to states to enhance ecosystem resilience against the two threats of critical infrastructure attacks and disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;",2023-03-22,2023,Flynn Acworth,Victoria University of Wellington,,1,https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.22313419,Cybersecurity,Cyberspace; Resilience (materials science); Disinformation; Computer security; Critical infrastructure,0.6,0.508,1,0.9306736886115804
W4392564814,dissertation,,Micro-grid design and dispatch co-optimisation considering uncertainties and demand response – Cases in New Zealand,"&lt;p dir=""ltr""&gt;One in eight people around the world, approximately one billion people, lack access to reliable electricity. Also, a great majority of people with access to electricity are experiencing some form of energy hardship – around a third (29%) of New Zealand households struggle to afford their electricity bills, spend a major part of their income on power, or often feel cold in winter. In this light, the ever-falling costs and continued efficiency improvements of renewable energy technologies are facilitating the ‘clean energy for all’ initiatives globally. Whilst considerable effort has been devoted to a range of interventions to address the underlying technological, institutional, and regulatory barriers, less attention has been given to address the glaring technical knowledge gaps in quantitative energy planning research, in terms of investment planning and capacity optimisation modelling; for the design of renewable energy systems, and specifically micro-grid systems. In response, this thesis addresses four notable gaps in the literature, namely: (i) the underrepresented usage of state-of-the-art meta-heuristic optimisation algorithms to determine the configurations of components, (ii) the lack of application of game-theoretic frameworks to the study of aggregator-mediated demand-side flexibility procurement, (iii) the limited number of approaches that quantify multiple parametric uncertainties simultaneously, and (iv) the narrow focus on joint micro-grid investment planning and energy scheduling optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=""ltr""&gt;To this end, the thesis introduces a novel strategic, meta-heuristic-based, demand response-integrated, uncertainty-aware, long-term micro-grid energy planning and capacity optimisation model, featuring the following key novel generalisations, each addressing one of the above-mentioned gaps: (i) utilising a state-of-the-art meta-heuristic optimisation algorithm, moth-flame optimiser, which is found to have superior performance to a wide variety of well-established and state-of-the-art meta-heuristics in minimising micro-grid life-cycle costs, (ii) characterising the utility-aggregator-customer interactions in interruptible load programmes using non-cooperative game theory in an equitable, market-based approach, (iii) expanding the number of model-inherent parametric uncertainties quantified concurrently without excessive computational demands, and (iv) integrating a dynamic, forward-looking scheduling design framework for the co-optimisation of investment and operational planning costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=""ltr""&gt;To demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in yielding the cost-minimal mix of candidate renewable energy technologies considered for integration into a micro-grid system, the model was applied to four previously unexplored test cases. Four on- and off-grid 100%-renewable and -reliable micro-grid systems were specifically conceptualised for the following cases in New Zealand: (i) the community of 400 permanent inhabitants on Stewart Island, (ii) a rural community of about 350 people near Feilding, (iii) the eight-lot Totarabank Subdivision located in the Wairarapa District, and (iv) a 1,000-strong community in Ohakune that swells to 8,000 people during skiing season. Crucially, the case studies, undertaken on different scales and with different degrees of topological complexity, provide a robust evidence base to support the main research proposition that not only is it technically feasible to implement the smart, integrated renewable energy systems optimised by the proposed model, but they also surpass unsubsidised retail parity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=""ltr""&gt;In particular, the thesis demonstrates that using the moth-flame optimisation algorithm, capturing the real flexibility potential of small- to medium-scale end-users, characterising multiple sources of data uncertainty, and adopting look-ahead, predictive dispatch strategies during the investment planning phases of stand-alone and grid-connected micro-grid systems, can pave the way toward achieving greater energy independence, -democracy, -resilience, and -security in rural and semi-urban areas in a cost-effective and environmentally efficient way. Most of all, the developed model provides in-depth, accurate, and robust strategic infrastructure planning decision-making support by adopting a holistic and comprehensive approach to energy planning optimisation. The approach enables a high-level, realistic analysis of the financial implications of the clean energy transition, especially in community-scale installations, necessary to cost-effectively promote private sector investment in the green economy – in the efforts to advance global electrification and economy-wide deep decarbonisation.&lt;/p&gt;",2024-03-07,2024,Soheil Mohseni,Victoria University of Wellington,,0,https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.25365826,Energy_Sustainability,Demand response; Renewable energy; Grid; Operations research; Electricity,0.4,1.0,0,0.9485440247260128
W4394694529,dissertation,,Improving Medical Document Classification via Feature Engineering,"&lt;p dir=""ltr""&gt;Document classification (DC) is the task of assigning the predefined labels to unseen documents by utilizing the model trained on the available labeled documents. DC has recently attracted much attention in the medical field because many issues can be formulated as classification problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=""ltr""&gt;For example, categorizing clinical risk factors, automatic disease classification, and electronic health records classification are some applications of text classification. DC is critical for medical document management and analysis. Medical DC can assist doctors in decision making and correct decisions can reduce medical expenses. Medical documents have special attributes that distinguish them from other texts and make them difficult to analyze. For example, many acronyms and abbreviations, and short expressions make it more challenging to extract knowledge. The current classification performance on medical documents is not satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=""ltr""&gt;Furthermore, the source of data is not sufficient due to patients’ privacy. This thesis aims to enhance the input feature sets of the medical DC methods to improve their classification performance. Additionally, it develops new data augmentation methods to deal with the shortage of data. To approach these goals, this work has developed new feature manipulation methods (such as future extraction, feature selection, and feature construction) in supervised learning systems to extract new meaningful feature sets. Moreover, it develops ontology and dictionary-based data augmentation approaches to create new synthetic documents. This thesis utilizes Evolutionary Computation (EC) techniques such as Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) and other deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) to achieve its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=""ltr""&gt;The main goal of this thesis is to develop new feature engineering approaches to medical document classification by using domain-specific knowledge of the problem which automatically extracts prominent features, constructing new high-level features, selects informative features, and augments new synthetic documents from the original documents. These methods can improve medical document classification performance by enriching the quality of the input data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=""ltr""&gt;This thesis develops three feature engineering approaches including domain-specific feature extraction, two-stage and three-stage PSO-based methods to automatically extract, construct, and select new high-level features for classification. The results demonstrate that two-stage and three stage approaches outperformed the compared related works. This thesis proposes two novel ontology-based data augmentation approaches to make new synthetic documents from the original training data sets for medical document classification. These approaches can make new synthetic documents from the original documents by employing a domain-specific ontology and a general dictionary to double/triple the size of the training data set and improve the performance of medical document classification. The results show that these approaches successfully improved medical document classification performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=""ltr""&gt;This thesis develops two dictionary-based data oversampling approaches to make new synthetic documents from the original training data sets for medical document classification problems. The proposed approach can make new synthetic documents with high variety compared to similar methods. The proposed approaches make an imbalanced data set balanced and improve the classification performance too. The results show better classification performance.&lt;/p&gt;",2024-04-10,2024,Mahdi Abdollahi,Victoria University of Wellington,,0,https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.25583424,AI_Machine_Learning,Feature (linguistics); Computer science; Information retrieval; Document classification; Feature engineering,0.4,0.7,1,1.0
W4323044469,review,journal,Storytelling with Image Data: A Systematic Review and Comparative Analysis of Methods and Tools,"In our digital age, data are generated constantly from public and private sources, social media platforms, and the Internet of Things. A significant portion of this information comes in the form of unstructured images and videos, such as the 95 million daily photos and videos shared on Instagram and the 136 billion images available on Google Images. Despite advances in image processing and analytics, the current state of the art lacks effective methods for discovering, linking, and comprehending image data. Consider, for instance, the images from a crime scene that hold critical information for a police investigation. Currently, no system can interactively generate a comprehensive narrative of events from the incident to the conclusion of the investigation. To address this gap in research, we have conducted a thorough systematic literature review of existing methods, from labeling and captioning to extraction, enrichment, and transforming image data into contextualized information and knowledge. Our review has led us to propose the vision of storytelling with image data, an innovative framework designed to address fundamental challenges in image data comprehension. In particular, we focus on the research problem of understanding image data in general and, specifically, curating, summarizing, linking, and presenting large amounts of image data in a digestible manner to users. In this context, storytelling serves as an appropriate metaphor, as it can capture and depict the narratives and insights locked within the relationships among data stored across different islands. Additionally, a story can be subjective and told from various perspectives, ranging from a highly abstract narrative to a highly detailed one.",2023-03-02,2023,Fariba Lotfi; Amin Beheshti; Helia Farhood; Matineh Pooshideh; Mansour Jamzad,Macquarie University,Algorithms,17,https://doi.org/10.3390/a16030135,AI_Machine_Learning,Storytelling; Computer science; Closed captioning; Context (archaeology); Narrative,1.0,0.583,1,0.9190535943867242
W4307751771,article,journal,Security of Blockchain and AI-Empowered Smart Healthcare: Application-Based Analysis,"A smart device carries a great amount of sensitive patient data as it offers innovative and enhanced functionalities in the smart healthcare system. Moreover, the components of healthcare systems are interconnected via the Internet, bringing significant changes to the delivery of healthcare services to individuals. However, easy access to healthcare services and applications has given rise to severe risks and vulnerabilities that hamper the performance of a smart healthcare system. Moreover, a large number of heterogeneous devices accumulate data that vary in terms of size and formats, making it challenging to manage the data in the healthcare repository and secure it from attackers who seek to profit from the data. Thus, smart healthcare systems are susceptible to numerous security threats and risks, such as hardware and software-based attacks, system-level attacks, and network attacks that have the potential to place patients’ lives at risk. An analysis of the literature revealed a research gap in that most security surveys on the healthcare ecosystem examined only the security challenges and did not explore the possibility of integrating modern technologies to alleviate security issues in the smart healthcare system. Therefore, in this article, we conduct a comprehensive review of the various most recent security challenges and their countermeasures in the smart healthcare environment. In addition, an artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain-based secure architecture is proposed as a case study to analyse malware and network attacks on wearable devices. The proposed architecture is evaluated using various performance metrics such as blockchain scalability, accuracy, and dynamic malware analysis.

This Special Issue is a collection of original scientific contributions and review papers that deal with smart buildings and communities. Demand response (DR) offers the capability to apply changes in the energy usage of consumers—from their normal consumption patterns—in response to changes in energy pricing over time. This leads to a lower energy demand during peak hours or during periods when an electricity grid's reliability is put at risk. Therefore, demand response is a reduction in demand designed to reduce peak load or avoid system emergencies. Hence, demand response can be more cost-effective than adding generation capabilities to meet the peak and/or occasional demand spikes. The underlying objective of DR is to actively engage customers in modifying their consumption in response to pricing signals. Demand response is expected to increase energy market efficiency and the security of supply, which will ultimately benefit customers by way of options for managing their electricity costs leading to reduced environmental impact.",2020-09-04,2020,Dionysia Kolokotsa; Gloria Pignatta; Kostas Gobakis; Sakeena Javaid; Nadeem Javaid,University of New South Wales,MDPI eBooks,0,https://doi.org/10.3390/books978-3-03928-267-8,Energy_Sustainability,Demand response; Peak demand; Smart grid; Electricity; Supply and demand,0.4,0.583,0,0.924523001437098

Industry 4.0 and digital transformation may increase productivity and reduce energy consumption. A digital twin (DT) is a key enabler in implementing Industry 4.0 in the areas of construction and smart cities. It is an emerging technology that connects different objects by utilising the advanced Internet of Things (IoT). As a technology, it is in high demand in various industries, and its literature is growing exponentially. Previous digital modeling practices, the use of data acquisition tools, human–computer–machine interfaces, programmable cities, and infrastructure, as well as Building Information Modeling (BIM), have provided digital data for construction, monitoring, or controlling physical objects. However, a DT is supposed to offer much more than digital representation. Characteristics such as bi-directional data exchange and real-time self-management (e.g., self-awareness or self-optimisation) distinguish a DT from other information modeling systems. The need to develop and implement DT is rising because it could be a core technology in many industrial sectors post-COVID-19. This paper aims to clarify the DT concept and differentiate it from other advanced 3D modeling technologies, digital shadows, and information systems. It also intends to review the state of play in DT development and offer research directions for future investigation. It recommends the development of DT applications that offer rapid and accurate data analysis platforms for real-time decisions, self-operation, and remote supervision requirements post-COVID-19.

Developing a secure IoT ecosystem is a daunting challenge that requires a systematic and holistic approach to identify and mitigate potential security threats. Cybersecurity research considerations play a critical role in this regard, as they provide the foundation for designing and implementing security measures that can address emerging risks. To achieve a secure IoT ecosystem, scientists and engineers must first define rigorous security specifications that serve as the foundation for developing secure devices, chipsets, and networks. Developing such specifications requires an interdisciplinary approach that involves multiple stakeholders, including cybersecurity experts, network architects, system designers, and domain experts. The primary challenge in IoT security is ensuring the system can defend against both known and unknown attacks. To date, the IoT research community has identified several key security concerns related to the architecture of IoT systems. These concerns include issues related to connectivity, communication, and management protocols. This research paper provides an all-inclusive and lucid review of the current state of anomalies and security concepts related to the IoT. We classify and analyze prevalent security distresses regarding IoT's layered architecture, including connectivity, communication, and management protocols.

W3024532996,article,journal,Hybrid Renewable Energy Microgrid for a Residential Community: A Techno-Economic and Environmental Perspective in the Context of the SDG7,"Energy, being a prime enabler in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs), should be affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern. One of the SDGs (i.e., SDG7) suggests that it is necessary to ensure energy access for all. In developing countries like India, the progress toward SDG7 has somewhat stagnated. The aging conventional electric power system has its dominant share of energy from fossil fuels, plagued with frequent power outages, and leaves many un-electrified areas. These are not characteristics of a sustainable and modern system in the context of the SDG7. Promoting renewable-based energy systems, especially in the context of microgrids (MGs), is one of the promising advances needed to rejuvenate the progress toward the SDG7. In this context, a hybrid renewable energy microgrid (HREM) is proposed that gives assurance for energy access to all in an affordable, reliable, and sustainable way through modern energy systems. In this paper, a techno-economic and environmental modeling of the grid-independent HREM and its optimization for a remote community in South India are presented. A case of HREM with a proposed configuration of photovoltaic/wind turbine/diesel generator/battery energy storage system (PV/WT/DG/BESS) was modeled to meet the community residential electric load requirements. This investigation dealt with the optimum sizes of the different components used in the HREM. The results of this model presented numerous feasible solutions. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the best solution from the four optimized results. From the results, it was established that a PV + DG + BESS based HREM was the most cost-effective configuration for the specific location. In addition, the obtained optimum solutions were mapped with the key criteria of the SDG7. This mapping also suggested that the PV + DG + BESS configuration falls within the context of the SDG7. Overall, it is understood that the proposed HREM would provide energy access to households that is affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern.",2020-05-12,2020,Nallapaneni Manoj Kumar; Shauhrat S.

W3213659842,article,journal,Techno-Economic Analysis of the Hybrid Solar PV/H/Fuel Cell Based Supply Scheme for Green Mobile Communication,"Hydrogen has received tremendous global attention as an energy carrier and an energy storage system. Hydrogen carrier introduces a power to hydrogen (P2H), and power to hydrogen to power (P2H2P) facility to store the excess energy in renewable energy storage systems, with the facts of large-scale storage capacity, transportability, and multiple utilities. This work examines the techno-economic feasibility of hybrid solar photovoltaic (PV)/hydrogen/fuel cell-powered cellular base stations for developing green mobile communication to decrease environmental degradation and mitigate fossil-fuel crises. Extensive simulation is carried out using a hybrid optimization model for electric rnewables (HOMER) optimization tool to evaluate the optimal size, energy production, total production cost, per unit energy production cost, and emission of carbon footprints subject to different relevant system parameters. In addition, the throughput, and energy efficiency performance of the wireless network is critically evaluated with the help of MATLAB-based Monte-Carlo simulations taking multipath fading, system bandwidth, transmission power, and inter-cell interference (ICI) into consideration. Results show that a more stable and reliable green solution for the telecommunications sector will be the macro cellular basis stations driven by the recommended hybrid supply system. The hybrid supply system has around 17% surplus electricity and 48.1 h backup capacity that increases the system reliability by maintaining a better quality of service (QoS).

The conventional grid-tied mode was used in addition to dispatch strategy-based control. The study’s test location was the loads in the Electrical, Electronic and Communication Engineering (EECE) department at Pabna University of Science and Technology (PUST), Pabna, Bangladesh. DIgSILENT PowerFactory was employed to determine the power system-based behaviors (electrical power, current, voltage, and frequency) of the proposed hybrid system, while a derivative-free algorithm was used for the expense, optimal size, and emission assessments. While developing the microgrid, load following (LoF) and cycle charging (CyC) control were employed. The microgrid is supposed to have a 23.31 kW peak load requirement. The estimated microgrid’s levelized cost of energy (LE), its net present cost (NC), its operating cost, and its annual harmful gas emissions were estimated in this work. Additionally, since the microgrid is grid-connected, the amount of energy output that might be exported to the grid was also estimated, which will potentially increase during blackouts.

W3041841208,article,journal,"COVID, CITIES and CLIMATE: Historical Precedents and Potential Transitions for the New Economy","The 2020 collapse of the global economy due to the Covid-19 pandemic has enabled us to think about long term trends and what the future could hold for our cities and regions, especially due to the climate agenda. The paper sets out the historical precedents for economic transitions after collapses that unleash new technologically based innovation waves. These are shown to be associated with different energy and infrastructure priorities and their transport and resulting urban forms. The new technologies in the past were emerging but mainstreamed as the new economy was built on new investments. The paper suggests that the new economy, for the next 30 years, is likely to be driven by the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agendas (summarised as zero carbon–zero poverty) and will have a strong base in a cluster of innovative technologies: renewable energy, electromobility, smart cities, hydrogen-based industry, circular economy technologies, and biophilic urbanism. The first three are well underway, and the other three will need interventions if not cultural changes and may miss being mainstreamed in this recovery but could still play a minor role in the new economy. The resulting urban transformations are likely to build on Covid-19 through “global localism” and could lead to five new features: (1) relocalised centres with distributed infrastructure, (2) tailored innovations in each urban fabric, (3) less car dependence, (4) symbiotic partnerships for funding, and (5) rewritten manuals for urban professionals.

W3010325996,book-chapter,ebook platform,Going with the flow,"This chapter discusses the research on plural security provision, outside and inside ports. Ports have been researched for various reasons, as the infrastructure of harbours makes them of interest to scholars from various fields. A significant amount of transport research exists, which is surprising given that 80% of world trade is realised through maritime transportation. Research that is dedicated to analysing how plural security provision is formed and executed can contribute meaningfully to a better understanding on how roles and responsibilities are allocated, how mentalities are shaped, how power is gained and exercised, and how regulations and standards regarding the delivery of security can be influenced by particular providers. Research has found that public agencies are themselves often concerned with keeping their autonomy and can therefore be reluctant to share information and collaborate in other ways that foster beneficial security partnerships.",2020-06-04,2020,Eva Dinchel; Marleen Easton,University of Western Australia,Routledge eBooks,5,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781351132275-3,Defense_Security,Flow (mathematics); Geology; Computer science; Mechanics; Physics,0.8,0.3,1,0.9156281539830582
W4390343647,article,journal,"Intelligent Head-bot, towards the Development of an AI Based Cognitive Platform","A cognitive humanoid head is an AI enabled head-bot platform that resembles human's cognitive abilities, such as perception, thinking, learning, and decision-making. The platform is able to interact with human through natural language processing and recognize individuals, thus allowing seamless communication between two parties. No such cognitive platform has been introduced in Bangladesh, thus creating an open field to contribute to the field of Machine Intelligence. This study aims to develop an AI based humanoid head (head-bot) capable of imitating a range of expressions, recognizing individuals, and interacts with visitors through general conversation. The head-bot skeleton is developed using a number of hexagonal blocks of PVC sheet to mimic a human-head-like structure where LCD, camera, microphones, and speaker are mounted. Two separate Machine Learning models are designed for face detection and recognitions, and voice enabled chat-bot implementation. The head-bot platform incorporates 2-DoF neck movements for various head gestures and face tracking. The Artificial Neural Network models are tested with accuracy of 95.05%, and 99.0%, for face detection and recognitions, and speech recognitions and response generation, respectively. According to the overall results and system performances, it seems that the proposed system has a number of good potentials for real life applications such as entertainment, guidance, conversations, interactive receptionists, personal companion, medical assistance, and so on.",2023-12-28,2023,Ramisha Fariha Baki; Md.

W3026809684,dissertation,,The politics of privacy protection: An analysis of resistance to metadata retention and encryption access laws,"This thesis examines the politics of privacy protection, focusing on how privacy advocates contest a moral equivalence at the core of the 'problem of going dark' – a claim that privacy-enhancing technologies enable the evasion of criminal investigations. Using the analytical constructs of signification, subjectivation, and identification, the thesis argues that Australian privacy advocates contest this claim via the articulation of a civic duty to disrupt the relations of domination that enable 'morally arbitrary' surveillance powers. Overall, the thesis argues this property of 'moral arbitrariness' is important for clarifying the distinction between advocating privacy protection and enabling methods of criminal evasion.",2020-01-01,2020,Michael Peter Wilson,Queensland University of Technology,,3,https://doi.org/10.5204/thesis.eprints.199696,Cybersecurity,CONTEST; Political science; Encryption; Politics; Duty,0.6,0.208,1,0.9331428877010466

W4221106278,article,journal,Knowledge Gaps in Curricular Guidance for ICS Security,"Industrial Control Systems are an essential mechanism to manage complex computer systems necessary for modern life. These include everything from water treatment and transportation to energy systems and manufacturing. These systems are becoming increasingly integrated and more complex, and they are being used to manage even more of the elements that make our everyday lives possible. They are therefore becoming both more attractive to cyber criminals and more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. More attention needs to be paid to increasing resources and capability in industrial cybersecurity (ICSS). A major element of this is to significantly improve both the quality and availability of education in this area. The process of development of these educational initiatives is aided by curriculum guidance documents. Of necessity ICSS has largely evolved in industrial settings. This exploratory study examines the curricular guidance available for ICSS research and compares it to industry requirements to identify gaps in curricular guidance. Specifically, this paper looks at the three leading guiding documents, the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, the Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education curriculum guidance, and the NSA CAE knowledge units. These are then compared to requirements identified from ICSS related job postings. We found that the primary cybersecurity curriculum guidance documents do not sufficiently address industry requirements for ICSS.",2022-03-08,2022,Ida Ngambeki; Sean McBride; Jill Slay,University of South Australia,Journal of The Colloquium for Information Systems Security Education,5,https://doi.org/10.53735/cisse.v9i1.149,Cybersecurity,Curriculum; Process (computing); Engineering management; Workforce; Task (project management),1.0,0.658,1,1.0
