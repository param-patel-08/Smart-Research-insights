introduction the early subcommittee the american clinical neurophysiology society acns set out standardize terminology periodic and rhythmic eeg patterns the critically ill aid future research involving such patterns the initial proposed terminology was published this was presented many meetings several continents subjected multiple rounds testing interrater reliability underwent many revisions and was then published acns guideline interrater agreement the version published early was very good with almost perfect agreement for seizures main terms and the modifier sharpness absolute amplitude frequency and number phases agreement was substantial for the and modifiers and but was only moderate for triphasic morphology and fair for evolution likely least partly because the short eeg samples provided the authors concluded that interrater agreement for most terms the acns critical care eeg terminology was high and that these terms were suitable for multicenter research the clinical significance these critical care eeg patterns with the help infrastructure funding from the american epilepsy society and administrative and website support from the acns database that incorporated the acns terminology was developed for clinical and research purposes tested during routine clinical care multiple centers and made available cost the acns website this greatly enhanced the ability complete multicenter investigations after the establishment the standardized terminology and free access database incorporating these terms there have been many investigations into the clinical significance rhythmic and periodic patterns rpps critically ill patients patterns such lateralized rhythmic delta activity lrda were found highly associated with acute seizures equivalent the association found with lateralized periodic discharges lpds one study the association all the main patterns the nomenclature with seizures was defined multicenter cohort almost patients with seizure rates highest for lpds intermediate for lrda and generalized periodic discharges gpds and lowest for generalized rhythmic delta activity grda this and other studies have shown that several the modifiers within the nomenclature indeed have clinically relevant meaning for example studies have shown that higher frequency especially higher prevalence longer duration and having plus modifier are all associated with higher chance acute seizures the other hand whether pattern was spontaneous stimulus induced did not seem have significant effect its association with seizures other investigations the triphasic morphology modifier was investigated blindly with multiple expert reviewers calling into question its relationship with metabolic encephalopathy and its lack relationship with seizures for patients with refractory status epilepticus treated with anesthetic induced coma the presence highly epileptiform bursts suggested that attempted wean off anesthetics that time was much more likely lead seizure recurrence than the bursts were not highly epileptiform even long term outcome seemed associated with some modifiers with higher risk later epilepsy found lpds were more prevalent had longer duration had plus modifier changes the version the terminology although the previous version the terminology was easy use reliable and valuable for both research and clinical care new terms and concepts have emerged this version incorporate recent research findings add definitions several new terms and clarify few definitions old terms most the old terms remain unchanged but there have been some important clarifications and corrections such the calculation the number phases and multiple additions all changes have been summarized table one new main term was added unilateral

from major modifier minor modifier methods all the definitions are based extensive discussions not only among the authors this document but also among many others both live and via email and questionnaires there was not always complete consensus some issues electronic voting with each voter blinded the opinion others for the first round was used for most these issues considered additional changes from previous versions from the literature such eliminating the second cutoff for defining electrographic seizures but because clear consensus was reached was close split decision this was not changed acns critical care eeg terminology contents eeg background sporadic epileptiform discharges rhythmic and periodic patterns rpps electrographic and electroclinical seizures new brief

including uteroplacental function maternal disease maternal cardiovascular function cardiac disease maternal nutrition altitude smoking and illicit drug use and presence pathological conditions such infection aneuploidy and some genetic conditions however uteroplacental insufficiency dysfunction represents one the most frequent causes abnormal growth otherwise normal fetus impaired fetal growth associated with increased risk perinatal mortality and morbidity and long term adverse infant outcome overall growth restricted fetuses have higher rate conditions associated with prematurity experience worse neurodevelopmental outcome and are increased risk non communicable diseases adulthood such hypertension metabolic syndrome insulin resistance type diabetes mellitus coronary heart disease and stroke prenatal recognition fetal growth restriction fgr major factor identified strategies aimed preventing stillbirth which cases are associated with fgr small for gestational age sga the late third trimester this guideline provides definitions fgr previously referred intrauterine growth restriction and sga and describes the best possible management options based current data and knowledge for the purposes this guideline assume that the pregnancy singleton pregnancy dating has been carried out correctly preferably the first trimester ultrasound and that there are fetal pathologies such aneuploidy congenital malformation infection details the grades recommendation used this guideline are provided appendix reporting levels evidence not applicable this guideline fetal growth dynamic process and its assessment requires multiple observations fetal size over time fetal size determined through biometric evaluation the head circumference biparietal diameter abdominal circumference and femur length and derivation estimated fetal weight efw computed different formulae the isuog guidelines ultrasound assessment fetal biometry and growth describe methodology reference ranges growth standards and quality control processes for appropriate assessment fetal biometry and diagnosis fetal growth disorders controversies relation reference ranges and other issues related the assessment fetal biometry are described this guideline fetus considered sga when its size biometric evaluation falls below predefined threshold for its gestational age the most common definition sga efw below the percentile given reference ranges nevertheless other thresholds have been described such the and percentiles the latter approximating score fgr condition that frequently but unhelpfully defined the fetus failing reach its genetically predetermined growth potential the identification fgr often not straightforward fetal growth cannot assessed through single biometric evaluation the fetal size and growth potential hypothetical the main distinction between sga and fgr that sga fetus may small but not increased risk adverse perinatal outcome while fetus with size above the percentile may fgr and increased risk adverse perinatal and long term outcome fetuses with birth weight below the percentile are increased risk stillbirth and perinatal mortality with those with birth weight below the percentile being the highest risk for this reason fetal size the lower extreme the growth charts for example efw below the percentile for given growth charts can used isolated criterion define fgr any gestational epoch however the optimal size birth that associated with the lowest perinatal mortality seems substantially higher than the median birth weight normal cohort fact population based cohort study found increased perinatal mortality even fetuses with birth weight within the normal range with those with birth weight between the and percentiles being the lowest risk and inverse association between perinatal mortality and birth weight below the percentile large scottish population based cohort study demonstrated progressive increase the risk stillbirth pregnancies with predicted birth weight below the percentile order differentiate between sga and fgr cases which the fetal size below the percentile additional biophysical parameters are required many methods have been proposed for this purpose such evaluation fetal growth velocity use customized growth charts doppler velocimetric evaluation placental and fetal circulations and use biomarkers some these biophysical parameters are also used monitor fetal status and delivery decision criteria umbilical artery doppler biophysical tools such ductus venosus velocimetry biophysical profile bpp scoring and cardiotocographic ctg assessment fetal heart rate short term variation stv are not used diagnostic criteria for fgr but for the surveillance and management pregnancies already diagnosed fgr and are discussed below there are several methods evaluate fetal growth velocity including use longitudinal growth charts assessment deviation from growth velocity charts and individualized growth assessment overall the objective evaluate the fetal growth trajectory and identify those fetuses that are deviating from their individual trajectory indicating failure reach their growth potential there evidence suggest that reduced fetal growth velocity the third trimester associated with increased risk adverse outcome reduced growth velocity normally taken fall between consecutive ultrasound scans percentiles for more commonly efw customized charts the fetal weight and growth are adjusted for variables known impact fetal size these can include maternal height weight age parity and ethnicity and fetal sex adjustment for these variables suggested allow for better identification sga fetuses risk perinatal complications methods evaluate fetal growth velocity and application customized growth charts for this purpose are described more detail the isuog guidelines ultrasound assessment fetal biometry and growth the rationale behind the application doppler velocimetry fetal growth assessment that can identify uteroplacental function through evaluation the uterine and umbilical arteries uteroplacental insufficiency putatively mediated through spiral artery maladaptation and alterations the villous vascular tree the fetal side doppler velocimetry allows evaluation the middle cerebral artery mca and ductus venosus fetal cardiovascular adaptation progresses from hypoxia acidemia lack physiological transformation the uterine arteries from high low resistance vessels thought reflect inadequate trophoblastic invasion the spiral arteries leaving high resistance circulation the persistence high uterine artery mean pulsatility index above the percentile associated with placental insufficiency and maternal vascular malperfusion the placenta progressively increasing the corresponds progressive reduction the placental surface area available for gas and nutrient exchange and increased fetal afterload resistance and associated with placental vascular insufficiency reflected absent and the end stage phase reversed end diastolic flow edf the reduced fetal mca consequence vasodilatation the called brain sparing effect this represents hemodynamic response fetal hypoxemia via direct vascular sensing oxygen tension the cerebral circuit and other vascular beds consequent redistribution fetal cardiac output occurs preferentially the coronary arteries and adrenal glands alterations the ductus venosus flow velocity waveform especially absent reversed wave are caused progressive dilatation the ductus venosus isthmus order increase the blood flow toward the heart attempt compensate for extreme oxygen deprivation others consider that absent reversed wave the ductus venosus consequence increased intra atrial pressure due high cardiac afterload increased vascular placental resistance and direct effect fetal acidemia myocardial cell function doppler velocimetry plays central role identification surveillance and management fgr because allows for the identification uteroplacental insufficiency and fetal cardiovascular adaptation hypoxemia importantly the two phenotypes fgr early onset and late onset are characterized different doppler velocimetry patterns discussed below the bpp score consists the combined evaluation fetal tone gross body movement breathing movement amniotic fluid volume and heart rate reactivity bpp score can predict both fetal and outcome the relationship between altered bpp score and fetal seems consistent across gestational ages score associated with fetal while score has sensitivity for acidemia this correlation remains highly significant even when using simplified bpp that based assessment only fetal heart rate and amniotic fluid volume reactive ctg virtually excludes fetal hypoxemia the fetal heart rate stv biophysical parameter obtained computerized ctg cctg that reflects autonomic nervous system function the context fgr and the accompanying presence severe hypoxemia hypoxia the fetal sympathetic and parasympathetic activity altered resulting reduced fetal heart rate variation and thus reduced stv cctg and evaluation stv have been validated against invasive testing fetal hypoxemia and acidemia and represent the only objective measure fetal heart rate visual inspection conventional ctg does not provide the same information cctg ctg represents largely subjective assessment with low intra and interobserver reproducibility placental biomarkers have potential role screening diagnosis and therapy placental disease linked hypertensive disorders pregnancy and fgr several placental factors have been investigated including placental proteins well microrna and mrna some placental proteins such pregnancy associated plasma protein are biomarkers placental function the first trimester though its predictive ability limited the soluble fms like tyrosine kinase sflt placental growth factor plgf ratio has been proposed short term predictor rule out pre eclampsia women whom this condition suspected clinically although some reports suggest that use the sflt plgf ratio might helpful the management and differentiation between sga and fgr the lack interventional trial data precludes the recommendation these tests adjunct ultrasound imaging the rapidly evolving research based discussion the use biomarkers screening for sga and fgr beyond the scope this guideline there are two main phenotypes fgr which differ significantly many aspects such prevalence prediction first trimester ultrasound gestational age onset placental histopathological findings doppler velocimetric profile maternal associated disease severity and perinatal outcome table presents the main characteristics the two phenotypes which are defined early onset and late onset fgr based the observation that one phenotype more frequent early gestation and the second near term the distinction between early and late fgr usually based diagnosis before after weeks gestation although doppler evaluation seems discriminate better than gestational age between the two phenotypes fgr with regards their association with pre eclampsia and adverse perinatal outcome weeks seems the optimal gestational age cut off diagnosis and provides reasonable classification the two fgr phenotypes this gestational age threshold therefore largely agreed upon the main criterion differentiate between early and late fgr and used distinguish between early and late onset fgr this guideline the definition fgr varies between different guidelines and author groups the criteria proposed international delphi consensus represent the most recognized definition fgr table recent validation study the performance these criteria was compared that fgr definition efw percentile using the hadlock growth standard predicting adverse neonatal outcome the study cohort spanned wide gestational age range and the two definitions had comparable performance though the delphi criteria were associated with improved prediction adverse neonatal outcome despite the fact that doppler velocimetry has been used obstetric practice for nearly four decades there universal agreement which indices thresholds and reference ranges use these considerations are not applicable when qualitative assessment performed such evaluation absent reversed ductus venosus wave absent reversed edf the but they affect doppler velocimetry quantitative evaluation international guidance how perform uteroplacental and fetal doppler velocimetry provided isuog there considerable methodological heterogeneity studies reporting reference ranges for mca and doppler indices and their ratio which may least partly explain the differences reported reference ranges even among studies with high methodological quality score there are significant differences the definition normality and normal ranges recent study evaluating the most cited articles providing reference ranges for mca and cerebroplacental ratio cpr found wide discrepancies doppler reference values that accounted for variability the percentile cut off value mca term similarly the study found significant differences the cut off for above the percentile and cpr below the percentile wide discrepancies have been reported reference ranges used for biometry doppler parameters and birth weight even national level centers with high expertise the management fgr that might significantly impact the diagnosis and management fgr another reason for the lack standardization quantitative doppler velocimetry that there uniformity doppler indices that are used especially research studies for example cerebral blood flow redistribution can defined mca below different percentile thresholds percentile scores multiples the median mom can defined umbilicocerebral ratio ucr cpr above below different percentile thresholds scores mom respectively the delphi consensus procedure identified cpr below the percentile and above the percentile doppler criteria define fgr the rationale behind the application the ratios mca and cpr and ucr instead the individual components that they have been shown more sensitive fetal hypoxia and associated more strongly with adverse perinatal outcome cpr reported studies more frequently than ucr recent study suggested that ucr may allow for better differentiation cases the abnormal range early fgr compared with cpr however should highlighted that there strong evidence favor either ratio the high variability doppler reference ranges and indices used has major clinical impact prenatal diagnosis monitoring timing delivery decision reproducibility and comparison findings between research studies efficacy clinical policies and protocols and many other aspects the discussion about which reference ranges use for the diagnosis and management fgr beyond the scope this guideline however these differences should acknowledged and action needed homogenize the adoption doppler indices thresholds and reference ranges clinical and research practice table summarizes the most relevant studies reporting reference charts for mca and its ratios early fgr particularly associated with maternal vascular malperfusion the placenta characterized abnormal transformation the spiral arteries pathologic features the placental villi and multifocal infarction these disease components result called placental insufficiency and form the most common basis for placenta mediated fgr chronic ischemia the placental villi impairs plgf secretion and leads excessive sflt release syncytial knots thus resulting elevated sflt plgf ratio which typifies early fgr and the associated hypertensive disorders pregnancy elevated doppler typically precedes cascade doppler alterations fetal heart rate changes and bpp modifications with end stage cardiovascular deterioration caused severe hypoxemia followed acidosis uterine artery and mca doppler abnormalities represent early changes early fgr and may present for many weeks before severe cardiovascular and metabolic deterioration occurs although absent edf represents progressive deterioration uteroplacental function still precedes critical fetal deterioration and the progression reversed edf might slow however the rate and rapidity alteration doppler from increased blood flow resistance absent edf determines the rate fetal deterioration the late deterioration early fgr characterized severe placental insufficiency reflected reversal the edf the and worsening generalized cardiovascular and metabolic failure reflected alterations the ductus venosus absent reversed wave this cardiovascular deterioration might precede occur parallel with the alteration the stv eventually manifesting abnormal bpp score spontaneous repetitive decelerations ctg and stillbirth present there effective therapy for early fgr though efficient recognition and management severe pre eclampsia may prolong some pregnancies with early fgr the timely use steroids followed magnesium sulfate transfer tertiary care center and consideration the safest mode delivery are the key concepts early fgr management ultimately delivery represents the only therapeutic option early fgr order prevent severe consequences from hypoxia and acidosis that can lead perinatal morbidity and mortality the other hand the decision deliver has balanced against the possible harm caused prematurity this further complicated the fact that the fetus suffering from growth restriction which independent risk factor for adverse outcomes associated with prematurity thus making the outcome even more unfavorable this highlighted the fact that fetuses with early fgr neonatal survival first exceeds after weeks gestation which weeks later than their appropriate for gestational age aga counterparts this view optimal monitoring and timing delivery are crucial importance when managing early fgr once early fgr suspected diagnosed the pregnancy should monitored and managed tertiary level fetal medicine and neonatal units according uniform management protocol multidisciplinary counseling neonatology and maternal fetal medicine specialists important evidence from randomized trial trial randomized umbilical and fetal flow europe truffle shows that monitoring and delivery timing according specific protocol including ductus venosus doppler and cctg provides better than expected outcomes should taken into account that cctg not available used universally that case addition doppler evaluation assessment conventional ctg and where undertaken bpp scoring should performed the loss fetal gross body movement association with ductus venosus doppler index alterations can predict fetal cord while loss fetal tone associated with base excess meq the surveillance frequency should based the severity fgr and abnormalities progressive deterioration doppler velocimetry warrants more intensive monitoring every days when absent reversed edf present there consensus monitoring frequency however suggested management strategies have been described elsewhere mca doppler one the first parameters that becomes abnormal early fgr there seems weak association between low mca and adverse short term neonatal outcome and between low mca and high ucr and year adverse neurodevelopmental outcome however gestational age delivery and birth weight have the most pronounced impact these outcomes thus mca doppler seems guide monitoring before weeks gestation but there evidence that should used determine delivery timing around women with early fgr will develop hypertensive disorders pregnancy mainly pre eclampsia thus regular blood pressure assessment and monitoring urinary protein creatinine ratio and baseline renal hepatic function asymptomatic women with early fgr are recommended although maternal plgf testing might useful the value biomarkers the diagnosis and management fgr the absence maternal hypertension remains undefined all available guidelines early fgr recommend corticosteroid prophylaxis prevent neonatal respiratory distress syndrome the birth likely occur before weeks however the royal college obstetricians and gynaecologists rcog recommends corticosteroid prophylaxis weeks despite this recommendation worth noting that randomized trial has been performed order establish whether the benefits corticosteroids premature fetuses also apply premature growth restricted fetuses whom the reduced metabolism corticosteroids smaller placenta and the already high level endogenous adrenal corticosteroids might further damage the white matter the brain and myelination fetuses with absent reversed edf enhanced daily surveillance warranted during steroid administration there good evidence for the efficacy magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection the context preterm delivery however the exact gestational age threshold which this attenuates remains unclear many guidelines and studies recommend magnesium sulfate prophylaxis for neuroprotection growth restricted fetuses though the suggested time commencement varies being weeks weeks weeks weeks gestation the absence strong evidence regarding the optimum gestational age magnesium sulfate prophylaxis that would allow for uniform application among countries recommend refer local national guidelines large prospective international multicenter study provided evidence that early gestational age delivery and low birth weight are the primary quantifying parameters that adversely impact the neonatal outcome fetuses with early onset fgr indeed for extreme prematurity weeks and extremely low birth weight each day prolongation the pregnancy improves neonatal survival after weeks ductus venosus doppler parameters emerged the primary predictor

the most common reported reasons for intensive care unit admission for patients with severe coronavirus disease covid are either hypoxemic respiratory failure leading mechanical ventilation hypotension requiring vasopressor support data aki are either lacking only reporting incidence the basis case series and retrospective studies this perspective emphasize that aki can severe complication covid and highlight the importance assessing defining and reporting the course aki understandably relevant information that normally would part clinical descriptions and research publications has not been collected because the magnitude and accelerated pace the covid pandemic great relevance preprint medrxiv reporting aki incidence among patients over high risk patients the authors analyzed kidney histology from autopsies six patients who had aki showing severe acute tubular necrosis with lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration but not clear from this report these

april medrxivdoi important report autopsy findings from deceased patients with covid again demonstrated prominent acute proximal tubular injury but also peritubular erythrocyte aggregation and glomerular fibrin thrombi with ischemic collapse this paper also reported endothelial damage hemosiderin deposition pigment casts related rhabdomyolysis and inflammation notably some these patients lacked evidence aki detected routine measures creatinine and bun highlighting the possibility substantial subclinical kidney injury recent clinical and autopsy reports covid from china and the united states confirm increased clotting and disseminated intravascular coagulation with small vessel thrombosis and pulmonary infarction further elevated dimer and low platelet levels correlated with worse outcomes are aware that some patients with covid manifest evidence microangiopathy other organ systems such splenic infarction presenting symptoms loin pain and hematuria suggesting renal infarction numerous observations treating physicians attest that there increased occurrence circuit clotting patients with covid undergoing dialysis covid also associated with increased myocardial injury that mimics myocardial infarction possibly from myocarditis and microangiopathy thus conceivable that the hypercoagulable state that appears characteristic complication severe covid could some cases foster the evolution acute tubular necrosis cortical necrosis and therefore irreversible kidney failure innate immunity and coagulation pathways are intricately linked covid associated macrophage activation hyperferritinemia cytokine storm and release pathogen associated molecular patterns and damage associated molecular proteins can result release tissue factor and activation coagulation factors that

epithelia positive but the specificity the antibody used needs established although far know sars cov rna has not been detected the kidney these results indicate that sars cov could directly infect human kidney tubules and induce cytoplasmic renal tubular inclusions feature observed other virus associated nephropathies thus although aki may attributable hypotension and decreased kidney perfusion secondary hemodynamic hemostatic factors associated sepsis one needs consider that viral infection the kidneys with viral replication directly kidney parenchyma also plays role the main binding site for sars cov like sars cov the ace protein which expressed the kidney much more than the lungs ace expressed the brush border apical membrane the proximal tubule where colocalizes with angiotensin converting enzyme ace and also present lower levels podocytes conceivable that the virus could enter the kidney invading podocytes first and thus gain access the tubular fluid and subsequently bind ace the proximal tubule primary human airway epithelia ace expressed apically and sars cov infection predominantly occurs the apical surface but infection can occur the basolateral surface low efficiency coronavirus entry into host target cells also requires fusion the viral envelope with cellular membranes fusion activated sars cov peptides are created specific proteolytic cleavage the

unknown viral replication podocytes and the ensuing damage could theory account for the proteinuria that has been reported patients with covid further covid associated hemophagocytic macrophage activation and microangiopathy could also cause aki and podocyte damage interest cases covid associated collapsing glomerulopathy have been described regardless direct viral infection the kidney angii likely increased the context acute lung injury and there evidence that ace downregulated aki this may lead type angiotensin receptor activation well decreased angiotensin formation and subsequent worsening aki this particularly important subpopulations patients who have ckd especially those with diabetic kidney disease dkd ace and ace mrna and protein expression are altered mouse models dkd and patients with dkd thus patients with ckd especially those with dkd who develop covid may higher risk aki because baseline upregulation the ace and downregulation ace combination that primes

proportions kidney cells expressing ace the sars cov binding site and proteases the tmprss family were compared between occidental and asian individuals interestingly the expression ace and kidney disease related genes was higher occidental donors relative asian donors this would suggest that the susceptibility kidney injury from coronavirus infection might higher individuals occidental rather than asian descent are not aware however data supporting this possibility despite the very limited information kidney involvement covid aki appears involve complex process driven virus mediated injury cytokine storm angii pathway activation dysregulation complement hypercoagulation and microangiopathy interacting with common and known risk factors for aki figure there paucity data regarding
