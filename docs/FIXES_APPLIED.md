## üîß Technical Details

### INSTITUTION_SYNONYMS Implementation
```python
INSTITUTION_SYNONYMS = {
    "University of Melbourne": ["The University of Melbourne", "Melbourne University", "UniMelb"],
    "University of Sydney": ["The University of Sydney", "Sydney University", "USYD"],
    "University of Queensland": ["The University of Queensland", "UQ"],
    "University of New South Wales": ["UNSW Sydney", "UNSW", "The University of New South Wales"],
    "Australian National University": ["ANU", "The Australian National University"],
    "RMIT University": ["RMIT", "Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"],
}
```

### How It Works:
1. Collector tries to resolve institution ID from OpenAlex
2. If primary name fails, tries each synonym in order
3. Uses fuzzy matching to find best match in OpenAlex database
4. Filters results to AU/NZ only (country_code:AU|NZ)

### Why This Helps:
- OpenAlex may store universities with different official names
- "University of Melbourne" vs "The University of Melbourne"
- "UNSW" vs "University of New South Wales" vs "UNSW Sydney"
- Synonyms increase success rate of ID resolution
